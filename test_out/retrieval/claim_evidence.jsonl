Then the king, who,\nwithout our suspecting it, had overheard our conversation, interrupted\nus by saying, ‘Villefort’—observe that the king did not pronounce the\nword Noirtier, but, on the contrary, placed considerable emphasis on\nthat of Villefort—‘Villefort,’ said his majesty, ‘is a young man of\ngreat judgment and discretion, who will be sure to make a figure in his\nprofession; I like him much, and it gave me great pleasure to hear that\nhe was about to become the son-in-law of the Marquis and Marquise de\nSaint-Méran. I should myself have recommended the match, had not the\nnoble marquis anticipated my wishes by requesting my consent to it.’”\n\n“Is it possible the king could have condescended so far as to express\nhimself so favorably of me?” asked the enraptured Villefort.\n\n“I give you his very words; and if the marquis chooses to be candid, he\nwill confess that they perfectly agree with what his majesty said to\nhim, when he went six months ago to consult him upon the subject of\nyour espousing his daughter.”\n\n0091m\n\n\n\n“That is true,” answered the marquis.\n\n“How much do I owe this gracious prince! What is there I would not do\nto evince my earnest gratitude!”\n\n“That is right,” cried the marquise. “I love to see you thus. Now,\nthen, were a conspirator to fall into your hands, he would be most\nwelcome.”\n\n“For my part, dear mother,” interposed Renée, “I trust your wishes will\nnot prosper, and that Providence will only permit petty offenders, poor\ndebtors, and miserable cheats to fall into M. de Villefort’s\nhands,—then I shall be contented.”\n\n“Just the same as though you prayed that a physician might only be\ncalled upon to prescribe for headaches, measles, and the stings of\nwasps, or any other slight affection of the epidermis. If you wish to\nsee me the king’s attorney, you must desire for me some of those\nviolent and dangerous diseases from the cure of which so much honor\nredounds to the physician.”\n\nAt this moment, and as though the utterance of Villefort’s wish had\nsufficed to effect its accomplishment, a servant entered the room, and\nwhispered a few words in his ear. Villefort immediately rose from table\nand quitted the room upon the plea of urgent business; he soon,\nhowever, returned, his whole face beaming with delight. Renée regarded\nhim with fond affection; and certainly his handsome features, lit up as\nthey then were with more than usual fire and animation, seemed formed\nto excite the innocent admiration with which she gazed on her graceful\nand intelligent lover.\n\n“You were wishing just now,” said Villefort, addressing her, “that I\nwere a doctor instead of a lawyer. Well, I at least resemble the\ndisciples of Esculapius in one thing [people spoke in this style in\n1815], that of not being able to call a day my own, not even that of my\nbetrothal.”\n\n“And wherefore were you called away just now?” asked Mademoiselle de\nSaint-Méran, with an air of deep interest.\n\n“For a very serious matter, which bids fair to make work for the\nexecutioner.”\n\n“How dreadful!” exclaimed Renée, turning pale.\n\n“Is it possible?” burst simultaneously from all who were near enough to\nthe magistrate to hear his words.\n\n“Why, if my information prove correct, a sort of Bonapartist conspiracy\nhas just been discovered.”\n\n“Can I believe my ears?” cried the marquise.\n\n“I will read you the letter containing the accusation, at least,” said\nVillefort:\n\n“‘The king’s attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and the\nreligious institutions of his country, that one named Edmond Dantès,\nmate of the ship _Pharaon_, this day arrived from Smyrna, after having\ntouched at Naples and Porto-Ferrajo, has been the bearer of a letter\nfrom Mur"}, {"chunk_id": 510, "text": "thrown into the river\nafter ascertaining that he was dead.

The\nnames have been purposely concealed; my father himself does not know\nwho this president was, and if he knows, he cannot tell you; proper\nnames are not in the dictionary.”\n\n“Oh, misery,” cried Franz: “the only hope which sustained me and\nenabled me to read to the end was that of knowing, at least, the name\nof him who killed my father! Sir, sir,” cried he, turning to Noirtier,\n“do what you can—make me understand in some way!”\n\n“Yes,” replied Noirtier.\n\n“Oh, mademoiselle, mademoiselle!” cried Franz, “your grandfather says\nhe can indicate the person. Help me,—lend me your assistance!”\n\nNoirtier looked at the dictionary. Franz took it with a nervous\ntrembling, and repeated the letters of the alphabet successively, until\nhe came to M. At that letter the old man signified “Yes.”\n\n“M,” repeated Franz. The young man’s finger, glided over the words, but\nat each one Noirtier answered by a negative sign. Valentine hid her\nhead between her hands. At length, Franz arrived at the word MYSELF.\n\n40046m\n\n\n\n“Yes!”\n\n“You!” cried Franz, whose hair stood on end; “you, M.

Progress of Cavalcanti the Younger\n\nMeanwhile M. Cavalcanti the elder had returned to his service, not in\nthe army of his majesty the Emperor of Austria, but at the gaming-table\nof the baths of Lucca, of which he was one of the most assiduous\ncourtiers. He had spent every farthing that had been allowed for his\njourney as a reward for the majestic and solemn manner in which he had\nmaintained his assumed character of father.\n\nM. Andrea at his departure inherited all the papers which proved that\nhe had indeed the honor of being the son of the Marquis Bartolomeo and\nthe Marchioness Oliva Corsinari. He was now fairly launched in that\nParisian society which gives such ready access to foreigners, and\ntreats them, not as they really are, but as they wish to be considered.\nBesides, what is required of a young man in Paris? To speak its\nlanguage tolerably, to make a good appearance, to be a good gamester,\nand to pay in cash. They are certainly less particular with a foreigner\nthan with a Frenchman. Andrea had, then, in a fortnight, attained a\nvery fair position.

Bertuccio, and to a king’s attorney at\nthat! But did he know what was meant by the terrible word ‘vendetta’?”\n\n“He knew so well, that from that moment he shut himself in his house,\nand never went out unattended, seeking me high and low. Fortunately, I\nwas so well concealed that he could not find me. Then he became\nalarmed, and dared not stay any longer at Nîmes, so he solicited a\nchange of residence, and, as he was in reality very influential, he was\nnominated to Versailles. But, as you know, a Corsican who has sworn to\navenge himself cares not for distance, so his carriage, fast as it\nwent, was never above half a day’s journey before me, who followed him\non foot. The most important thing was, not to kill him only—for I had\nan opportunity of doing so a hundred times—but to kill him without\nbeing discovered—at least, without being arrested. I no longer belonged\nto myself, for I had my sister-in-law to protect and provide for.\n\n“For three months I watched M. de Villefort, for three months he took\nnot a step out-of-doors without my following him. At length I\ndiscovered that he went mysteriously to Auteuil. I followed him\nthither, and I saw him enter the house where we now are, only, instead\nof entering by the great door that looks into the street, he came on\nhorseback, or in his carriage, left the one or the other at the little\ninn, and entered by the gate you see there.”\n\nMonte Cristo made a sign with his head to show that he could discern in\nthe darkness the door to which Bertuccio alluded.\n\n“As I had nothing more to do at Versailles, I went to Auteuil, and\ngained all the information I could. If I wished to surprise him, it was\nevident this was the spot to lie in wait for him. The house belonged,\nas the concierge informed your excellency, to M. de Saint-Méran,\nVillefort’s father-in-law. M. de Saint-Méran lived at Marseilles, so\nthat this country house was useless to him, and it was reported to be\nlet to a young widow, known only by the name of ‘the Baroness.’\n\n“One evening, as I was looking over the wall, I saw a young and\nhandsome woman who was walking alone in that garden, which was not\noverlooked by any windows, and I guessed that she was awaiting M. de\nVillefort. When she was sufficiently near for me to distinguish her\nfeatures, I saw she was from eighteen to nineteen, tall and very fair.\nAs she had a loose muslin dress on and as nothing concealed her figure,\nI saw she would ere long become a mother. A few moments after, the\nlittle door was opened and a man entered. The young woman hastened to\nmeet him. They threw themselves into each other’s arms, embraced\ntenderly, and returned together to the house. The man was M. de\nVillefort; I fully believed that when he went out in the night he would\nbe forced to traverse the whole of the garden alone.”\n\n20291m\n\n\n\n“And,” asked the count, “did you ever know the name of this woman?”\n\n“No, excellency,” returned Bertuccio; “you will see that I had no time\nto learn it.”\n\n“Go on.”\n\n“That evening,” continued Bertuccio, “I could have killed the\nprocureur, but as I was not sufficiently acquainted with the\nneighborhood, I was fearful of not killing him on the spot, and that if\nhis cries were overheard I might be taken; so I put it off until the\nnext occasion, and in order that nothing should escape me, I took a\nchamber looking into the street bordered by the wall of the garden.\nThree days after, about seven o’clock in the evening, I saw a servant\non horseback leave the house at full gallop, and take the road to\nSèvres. I concluded that he was going to Versailles, and I was not\ndeceived. Three hours later, the man returned covered with dust, his\nerrand was performed, and two minutes after, another man on foot,\nmuffled in a mantle, opened the little door of the garden, which he\nclosed after him. I descende"}, {"chunk_id": 40, "text": "ot over; in a word I was, as I told you, at\nmy marriage feast; and I should have been married in an hour, and\ntomorrow I intended to start for Paris, had I not been arrested on this\ncharge which you as well as I now see to be unjust.”\n\n“Ah,” said Villefort, “this seems to me the truth. If you have been\nculpable, it was imprudence, and this imprudence was in obedience to\nthe orders of your captain. Give up this letter you have brought from\nElba, and pass your word you will appear should you be required, and go\nand rejoin your friends.\n\n“I am free, then, sir?” cried Dantès joyfully.\n\n“Yes; but first give me this letter.”\n\n“You have it already, for it was taken from me with some others which I\nsee in that packet.”\n\n“Stop a moment,” said the deputy, as Dantès took his hat and gloves.\n“To whom is it addressed?”\n\n_“To Monsieur Noirtier, Rue Coq-Héron, Paris.”_ Had a thunderbolt\nfallen into the room, Villefort could not have been more stupefied. He\nsank into his seat, and hastily turning over the packet, drew forth the\nfatal letter, at which he glanced with an expression of terror.\n\n“M. Noirtier, Rue Coq-Héron, No. 13,” murmured he, growing still paler.\n\n“Yes,” said Dantès; “do you know him?”\n\n“No,” replied Villefort; “a faithful servant of the king does not know\nconspirators.”\n\n0103m\n\n\n\n“It is a conspiracy, then?” asked Dantès, who after believing himself\nfree, now began to feel a tenfold alarm. “I have, however, already told\nyou, sir, I was entirely ignorant of the contents of the letter.”\n\n“Yes; but you knew the name of the person to whom it was addressed,”\nsaid Villefort.\n\n“I was forced to read the address to know to whom to give it.”\n\n“Have you shown this letter to anyone?” asked Villefort, becoming still\nmore pale.\n\n“To no one, on my honor.”\n\n“Everybody is ignorant that you are the bearer of a letter from the\nIsland of Elba, and addressed to M. Noirtier?”\n\n“Everybody, except the person who gave it to me.”\n\n“And that was too much, far too much,” murmured Villefort. Villefort’s\nbrow darkened more and more, his white lips and clenched teeth filled\nDantès with apprehension. After reading the letter, Villefort covered\nhis face with his hands.\n\n“Oh,” said Dantès timidly, “what is the matter?” Villefort made no\nanswer, but raised his head at the expiration of a few seconds, and\nagain perused the letter.\n\n“And you say that you are ignorant of the contents of this letter?”\n\n“I give you my word of honor, sir,” said Dantès; “but what is the\nmatter? You are ill—shall I ring for assistance?—shall I call?”\n\n“No,” said Villefort, rising hastily; “stay where you are. It is for me\nto give orders here, and not you.”\n\n“Monsieur,” replied Dantès proudly, “it was only to summon assistance\nfor you.”\n\n“I want none; it was a temporary indisposition. Attend to yourself;\nanswer me.” Dantès waited, expecting a question, but in vain. Villefort\nfell back on his chair, passed his hand over his brow, moist with\nperspiration, and, for the third time, read the letter.\n\n“Oh, if he knows the contents of this!” murmured he, “and that Noirtier\nis the father of Villefort, I am lost!” And he fixed his eyes upon\nEdmond as if he would have penetrated his thoughts.\n\n“Oh, it is impossible to doubt it,” cried he, suddenly.\n\n“In heaven’s name!” cried the unhappy young man, “if you doubt me,\nquestion me; I will answer you.” Villefort made a violent effort, and\nin a tone he strove to render firm:\n\n“Sir,” said he, “I am no longer able, as I had hoped, to restore you\nimmediately to liberty; before doing so, I must consult the trial\njustice; what my own feeling is you already know.”\n\n“Oh, monsieur,” cried Dantès, “you have been rather a friend than a\njudge.”\n\n0105m\n\n\n\n“Well, I must detain you some time longer, but I will strive to make it\nas short as possible. The principal charge against you is this letter,\nand you see——” Villefort approached the fire, cast it in, and waited\nuntil it was entirely consumed.\n\n“You see, I destroy it?”\n\n“Oh,” exclaimed Dantès, “you are goodness i"}, {"chunk_id": 668, "text": ".\n\n“Gentlemen,” he said in a hoarse voice, “give me your word of honor\nthat this horrible secret shall forever remain buried amongst\nourselves!” The two men drew back.\n\n“I entreat you——” continued Villefort.\n\n“But,” said Morrel, “the culprit—the murderer—the assassin.”\n\n“Do not alarm yourself, sir; justice will be done,” said Villefort. “My\nfather has revealed the culprit’s name; my father thirsts for revenge\nas much as you do, yet even he conjures you as I do to keep this\nsecret. Do you not, father?”\n\n“Yes,” resolutely replied Noirtier. Morrel suffered an exclamation of\nhorror and surprise to escape him.\n\n“Oh, sir,” said Villefort, arresting Maximilian by the arm, “if my\nfather, the inflexible man, makes this request, it is because he knows,\nbe assured, that Valentine will be terribly revenged. Is it not so,\nfather?”\n\nThe old man made a sign in the affirmative. Villefort continued:\n\n“He knows me, and I have pledged my word to him. Rest assured,\ngentlemen, that within three days, in a less time than justice would\ndemand, the revenge I shall have taken for the murder of my child will\nbe such as to make the boldest heart tremble;” and as he spoke these\nwords he ground his teeth, and grasped the old man’s senseless hand.\n\n“Will this promise be fulfilled, M. Noirtier?” asked Morrel, while\nd’Avrigny looked inquiringly.\n\n“Yes,” replied Noirtier with an expression of sinister joy.\n\n“Swear, then,” said Villefort, joining the hands of Morrel and\nd’Avrigny, “swear that you will spare the honor of my house, and leave\nme to avenge my child.”\n\nD’Avrigny turned round and uttered a very feeble “Yes,” but Morrel,\ndisengaging his hand, rushed to the bed, and after having pressed the\ncold lips of Valentine with his own, hurriedly left, uttering a long,\ndeep groan of despair and anguish.\n\nWe have before stated that all the servants had fled. M. de Villefort\nwas therefore obliged to request M. d’Avrigny to superintend all the\narrangements consequent upon a death in a large city, more especially a\ndeath under such suspicious circumstances.\n\nIt was something terrible to witness the silent agony, the mute despair\nof Noirtier, whose tears silently rolled down his cheeks. Villefort\nretired to his study, and d’Avrigny left to summon the doctor of the\nmayoralty, whose office it is to examine bodies after decease, and who\nis expressly named “the doctor of the dead.” M. Noirtier could not be\npersuaded to quit his grandchild. At the end of a quarter of an hour M.\nd’Avrigny returned with his associate; they found the outer gate\nclosed, and not a servant remaining in the house; Villefort himself was\nobliged to open to them. But he stopped on the landing; he had not the\ncourage to again visit the death chamber. The two doctors, therefore,\nentered the room alone. Noirtier was near the bed, pale, motionless,\nand silent as the corpse. The district doctor approached with the\nindifference of a man accustomed to spend half his time amongst the\ndead; he then lifted the sheet which was placed over the face, and just\nunclosed the lips.\n\n“Alas,” said d’Avrigny, “she is indeed dead, poor child!”\n\n50099m\n\n\n\n“Yes,” answered the doctor laconically, dropping the sheet he had\nraised. Noirtier uttered a kind of hoarse, rattling sound; the old\nman’s eyes sparkled, and the good doctor understood that he wished to\nbehold his child. He therefore approached the bed, and while his\ncompanion was dipping the fingers with which he had touched the lips of\nthe corpse in chloride of lime, he uncovered the calm and pale face,\nwhich looked like that of a sleeping angel.\n\nA tear, which appeared in the old man’s eye, expressed his thanks to\nthe doctor. The doctor of the dead then laid his permit on the corner\nof the table, and having fulfilled his duty, was conducted out by\nd’Avrigny. Villefort met them at the door of his study; having in a few\nwords thanked the district doctor, he turned to d’Avrigny, and said:\n\n“And now the priest.”\n\n“Is there any particular priest you wish to pray with Va"}]}

I invented a preparation that makes linen as\nsmooth and as easy to write on as parchment.”\n\n“You are, then, a chemist?”\n\n“Somewhat; I know Lavoisier, and was the intimate friend of Cabanis.”\n\n“But for such a work you must have needed books—had you any?”\n\n“I had nearly five thousand volumes in my library at Rome; but after\nreading them over many times, I found out that with one hundred and\nfifty well-chosen books a man possesses, if not a complete summary of\nall human knowledge, at least all that a man need really know. I\ndevoted three years of my life to reading and studying these one\nhundred and fifty volumes, till I knew them nearly by heart; so that\nsince I have been in prison, a very slight effort of memory has enabled\nme to recall their contents as readily as though the pages were open\nbefore me. I could recite you the whole of Thucydides, Xenophon,\nPlutarch, Titus Livius, Tacitus, Strada, Jornandes, Dante, Montaigne,\nShakespeare, Spinoza, Machiavelli, and Bossuet. I name only the most\nimportant.”\n\n“You are, doubtless, acquainted with a variety of languages, so as to\nhave been able to read all these?”\n\n“Yes, I speak five of the modern tongues—that is to say, German,\nFrench, Italian, English, and Spanish; by the aid of ancient Greek I\nlearned modern Greek—I don’t speak it so well as I could wish, but I am\nstill trying to improve myself.”\n\n“Improve yourself!” repeated Dantès; “why, how can you manage to do\nso?”\n\n“Why, I made a vocabulary of the words I knew; turned, returned, and\narranged them, so as to enable me to express my thoughts through their\nmedium. I know nearly one thousand words, which is all that is\nabsolutely necessary, although I believe there are nearly one hundred\nthousand in the dictionaries. I cannot hope to be very fluent, but I\ncertainly should have no difficulty in explaining my wants and wishes;\nand that would be quite as much as I should ever require.”\n\nStronger grew the wonder of Dantès, who almost fancied he had to do\nwith one gifted with supernatural powers; still hoping to find some\nimperfection which might bring him down to a level with human beings,\nhe added, “Then if you were not furnished with pens, how did you manage\nto write the work you speak of?”\n\n“I made myself some excellent ones, which would be universally\npreferred to all others if once known. You are aware what huge whitings\nare served to us on _maigre_ days. Well, I selected the cartilages of\nthe heads of these fishes, and you can scarcely imagine the delight\nwith which I welcomed the arrival of each Wednesday, Friday, and\nSaturday, as affording me the means of increasing my stock of pens; for\nI will freely confess that my historical labors have been my greatest\nsolace and relief.

At every step that Edmond took he\ndisturbed the lizards glittering with the hues of the emerald; afar off\nhe saw the wild goats bounding from crag to crag. In a word, the island\nwas inhabited, yet Edmond felt himself alone, guided by the hand of\nGod.\n\nHe felt an indescribable sensation somewhat akin to dread—that dread of\nthe daylight which even in the desert makes us fear we are watched and\nobserved. This feeling was so strong that at the moment when Edmond was\nabout to begin his labor, he stopped, laid down his pickaxe, seized his\ngun, mounted to the summit of the highest rock, and from thence gazed\nround in every direction.\n\nBut it was not upon Corsica, the very houses of which he could\ndistinguish; or on Sardinia; or on the Island of Elba, with its\nhistorical associations; or upon the almost imperceptible line that to\nthe experienced eye of a sailor alone revealed the coast of Genoa the\nproud, and Leghorn the commercial, that he gazed. It was at the\nbrigantine that had left in the morning, and the tartan that had just\nset sail, that Edmond fixed his eyes.\n\nThe first was just disappearing in the straits of Bonifacio; the other,\nfollowing an opposite direction, was about to round the Island of\nCorsica.\n\nThis sight reassured him. He then looked at the objects near him. He\nsaw that he was on the highest point of the island,—a statue on this\nvast pedestal of granite, nothing human appearing in sight, while the\nblue ocean beat against the base of the island, and covered it with a\nfringe of foam. Then he descended with cautious and slow step, for he\ndreaded lest an accident similar to that he had so adroitly feigned\nshould happen in reality.\n\nDantès, as we have said, had traced the marks along the rocks, and he\nhad noticed that they led to a small creek, which was hidden like the\nbath of some ancient nymph. This creek was sufficiently wide at its\nmouth, and deep in the centre, to admit of the entrance of a small\nvessel of the lugger class, which would be perfectly concealed from\nobservation.\n\nThen following the clew that, in the hands of the Abbé Faria, had been\nso skilfully used to guide him through the Dædalian labyrinth of\nprobabilities, he thought that the Cardinal Spada, anxious not to be\nwatched, had entered the creek, concealed his little barque, followed\nthe line marked by the notches in the rock, and at the end of it had\nburied his treasure. It was this idea that had brought Dantès back to\nthe circular rock. One thing only perplexed Edmond, and destroyed his\ntheory. How could this rock, which weighed several tons, have been\nlifted to this spot, without the aid of many men?\n\nSuddenly an idea flashed across his mind. Instead of raising it,\nthought he, they have lowered it. And he sprang from the rock in order\nto inspect the base on which it had formerly stood.\n\nHe soon perceived that a slope had been formed, and the rock had slid\nalong this until it stopped at the spot it now occupied. A large stone\nhad served as a wedge; flints and pebbles had been inserted around it,\nso as to conceal the orifice; this species of masonry had been covered\nwith earth, and grass and weeds had grown there, moss had clung to the\nstones, myrtle-bushes had taken root, and the old rock seemed fixed to\nthe earth.\n\n0301m\n\n\n\nDantès dug away the earth carefully, and detected, or fancied he\ndetected, the ingenious artifice. He attacked this wall, cemented by\nthe hand of time, with his pickaxe. After ten minutes’ labor the wall\ngave way, and a hole large enough to insert the arm was opened.\n\nDantès went and cut the strongest olive-tree he could find, stripped\noff its branches, inserted it in the hole, and used it as a lever. But\nthe rock was too heavy, and too firmly wedged, to be m"}, {"chunk_id": 108, "text": "\ndetected, and they would undoubtedly have been separated. Thus a new, a\nstronger, and more inexorable barrier was interposed to cut off the\nrealization of their hopes.\n\n“You see,” said the young man, with an air of sorrowful resignation, to\nFaria, “that God deems it right to take from me any claim to merit for\nwhat you call my devotion to you.

But my real treasure is not that, my dear friend, which awaits\nme beneath the sombre rocks of Monte Cristo, it is your presence, our\nliving together five or six hours a day, in spite of our jailers; it is\nthe rays of intelligence you have elicited from my brain, the languages\nyou have implanted in my memory, and which have taken root there with\nall their philological ramifications. These different sciences that you\nhave made so easy to me by the depth of the knowledge you possess of\nthem, and the clearness of the principles to which you have reduced\nthem—this is my treasure, my beloved friend, and with this you have\nmade me rich and happy. Believe me, and take comfort, this is better\nfor me than tons of gold and cases of diamonds, even were they not as\nproblematical as the clouds we see in the morning floating over the\nsea, which we take for _terra firma_, and which evaporate and vanish as\nwe draw near to them. To have you as long as possible near me, to hear\nyour eloquent speech,—which embellishes my mind, strengthens my soul,\nand makes my whole frame capable of great and terrible things, if I\nshould ever be free,—so fills my whole existence, that the despair to\nwhich I was just on the point of yielding when I knew you, has no\nlonger any hold over me; and this—this is my fortune—not chimerical,\nbut actual. I owe you my real good, my present happiness; and all the\nsovereigns of the earth, even Cæsar Borgia himself, could not deprive\nme of this.”\n\nThus, if not actually happy, yet the days these two unfortunates passed\ntogether went quickly. Faria, who for so long a time had kept silence\nas to the treasure, now perpetually talked of it. As he had prophesied\nwould be the case, he remained paralyzed in the right arm and the left\nleg, and had given up all hope of ever enjoying it himself. But he was\ncontinually thinking over some means of escape for his young companion,\nand anticipating the pleasure he would enjoy. For fear the letter might\nbe some day lost or stolen, he compelled Dantès to learn it by heart;\nand Dantès knew it from the first to the last word. Then he destroyed\nthe second portion, assured that if the first were seized, no one would\nbe able to discover its real meaning. Whole hours sometimes passed\nwhile Faria was giving instructions to Dantès,—instructions which were\nto serve him when he was at liberty. Then, once free, from the day and\nhour and moment when he was so, he could have but one only thought,\nwhich was, to gain Monte Cristo by some means, and remain there alone\nunder some pretext which would arouse no suspicions; and once there, to\nendeavor to find the wonderful caverns, and search in the appointed\nspot,—the appointed spot, be it remembered, being the farthest angle in\nthe second opening.\n\nIn the meanwhile the hours passed, if not rapidly, at least tolerably.\nFaria, as we have said, without having recovered the use of his hand\nand foot, had regained all the clearness of his understanding, and had\ngradually, besides the moral instructions we have detailed, taught his\nyouthful companion the patient and sublime duty of a prisoner, who\nlearns to make something from nothing. They were thus perpetually\nemployed,—Faria, that he might not see himself grow old; Dantès, for\nfear of recalling the almost extinct past which now only floated in his\nmemory like a distant light wandering in the night. So life went on for\nthem as it does for those who are not victims of misfortune and whose\nactivities gl"}, {"chunk_id": 473, "text": "\ntalent are they celebrated?

The thing was discussed for a long time, but finally decided\nin his favor. I can assure you the vertebra made a great noise in the\nlearned world, and the gentleman, who was only a knight of the Legion\nof Honor, was made an officer.”\n\n“Come,” said Monte Cristo, “this cross seems to me to be wisely\nawarded. I suppose, had he found another additional vertebra, they\nwould have made him a commander.”\n\n“Very likely,” said Albert.\n\n“And who can that person be who has taken it into his head to wrap\nhimself up in a blue coat embroidered with green?”\n\n“Oh, that coat is not his own idea; it is the Republic’s, which deputed\nDavid12 to devise a uniform for the Academicians.”\n\n“Indeed?” said Monte Cristo; “so this gentleman is an Academician?”\n\n“Within the last week he has been made one of the learned assembly.”\n\n“And what is his especial talent?”\n\n“His talent? I believe he thrusts pins through the heads of rabbits, he\nmakes fowls eat madder, and punches the spinal marrow out of dogs with\nwhalebone.”\n\n“And he is made a member of the Academy of Sciences for this?”\n\n“No; of the French Academy.”\n\n“But what has the French Academy to do with all this?”\n\n“I was going to tell you. It seems——”\n\n“That his experiments have very considerably advanced the cause of\nscience, doubtless?”\n\n“No; that his style of writing is very good.”\n\n“This must be very flattering to the feelings of the rabbits into whose\nheads he has thrust pins, to the fowls whose bones he has dyed red, and\nto the dogs whose spinal marrow he has punched out?”\n\nAlbert laughed.\n\n“And the other one?” demanded the count.\n\n“That one?”\n\n“Yes, the third.”\n\n“The one in the dark blue coat?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“He is a colleague of the count, and one of the most active opponents\nto the idea of providing the Chamber of Peers with a uniform. He was\nvery successful upon that question. He stood badly with the Liberal\npapers, but his noble opposition to the wishes of the court is now\ngetting him into favor with the journalists. They talk of making him an\nambassador.”\n\n30303m\n\n\n\n“And what are his claims to the peerage?”\n\n“He has composed two or three comic operas, written four or five\narticles in the _Siècle_, and voted five or six years on the\nministerial side.”\n\n“Bravo, viscount,” said Monte Cristo, smiling; “you are a delightful\n_cicerone_. And now you will do me a favor, will you not?”\n\n“What is it?”\n\n“Do not introduce me to any of these gentlemen; and should they wish\nit, you will warn me.” Just then the count felt his arm pressed. He\nturned round; it was Danglars.\n\n“Ah! is it you, baron?” said he.\n\n“Why do you call me baron?” said Danglars; “you know that I care\nnothing for my title. I am not like you, viscount; you like your title,\ndo you not?”\n\n“Certainly,” replied Albert, “seeing that without my title I should be\nnothing; while you, sacrificing the baron, would still remain the\nmillionaire.”\n\n“Which seems to me the finest title under the royalty of July,” replied\nDanglars.\n\n“Unfortunately,” said Monte Cristo, “one’s title to a millionaire does\nnot last for life, like that of baron, peer of France, or academician;\nfor example, the millionaires Franck & Poulmann, of Frankfurt, who have\njust become bankrupts.”\n\n“Indeed?” said Danglars, becoming pale.\n\n“Yes; I received the news this evening by a courier. I had about a\nmillion in their hands, but, warned in time, I withdrew it a month\nago.”\n\n“Ah, _mon Dieu!_” exclaimed Danglars, “they have drawn on me for\n200,000 francs!”\n\n“Well, you can throw out the draft; their signature is worth five per\ncent.”\n\n“Yes, but it is too late,” said Danglars, “I have honored their bills.”\n\n“Then,” said Monte Cristo, “here are 200,000 francs gone after——”\n\n“Hush, do not mention these things,” said Da"}, {"chunk_id": 109, "text": "gradually, besides the moral instructions we have detailed, taught his\nyouthful companion the patient and sublime duty of a prisoner, who\nlearns to make something from nothing.

So life went on for\nthem as it does for those who are not victims of misfortune and whose\nactivities glide along mechanically and tranquilly beneath the eye of\nProvidence.\n\nBut beneath this superficial calm there were in the heart of the young\nman, and perhaps in that of the old man, many repressed desires, many\nstifled sighs, which found vent when Faria was left alone, and when\nEdmond returned to his cell.\n\nOne night Edmond awoke suddenly, believing that he heard someone\ncalling him. He opened his eyes upon utter darkness. His name, or\nrather a plaintive voice which essayed to pronounce his name, reached\nhim. He sat up in bed and a cold sweat broke out upon his brow.\nUndoubtedly the call came from Faria’s dungeon.\n\n“Alas,” murmured Edmond; “can it be?”\n\nHe moved his bed, drew up the stone, rushed into the passage, and\nreached the opposite extremity; the secret entrance was open. By the\nlight of the wretched and wavering lamp, of which we have spoken,\nDantès saw the old man, pale, but yet erect, clinging to the bedstead.\nHis features were writhing with those horrible symptoms which he\nalready knew, and which had so seriously alarmed him when he saw them\nfor the first time.\n\n“Alas, my dear friend,” said Faria in a resigned tone, “you understand,\ndo you not, and I need not attempt to explain to you?”\n\nEdmond uttered a cry of agony, and, quite out of his senses, rushed\ntowards the door, exclaiming, “Help, help!”\n\nFaria had just sufficient strength to restrain him.\n\n“Silence,” he said, “or you are lost. We must now only think of you, my\ndear friend, and so act as to render your captivity supportable or your\nflight possible. It would require years to do again what I have done\nhere, and the results would be instantly destroyed if our jailers knew\nwe had communicated with each other. Besides, be assured, my dear\nEdmond, the dungeon I am about to leave will not long remain empty;\nsome other unfortunate being will soon take my place, and to him you\nwill appear like an angel of salvation. Perhaps he will be young,\nstrong, and enduring, like yourself, and will aid you in your escape,\nwhile I have been but a hindrance. You will no longer have half a dead\nbody tied to you as a drag to all your movements. At length Providence\nhas done something for you; he restores to you more than he takes away,\nand it was time I should die.”\n\nEdmond could only clasp his hands and exclaim, “Oh, my friend, my\nfriend, speak not thus!” and then resuming all his presence of mind,\nwhich had for a moment staggered under this blow, and his strength,\nwhich had failed at the words of the old man, he said, “Oh, I have\nsaved you once, and I will save you a second time!” And raising the\nfoot of the bed, he drew out the phial, still a third filled with the\nred liquor.\n\n“See,” he exclaimed, “there remains still some of the magic draught.\nQuick, quick! tell me what I must do this time; are there any fresh\ninstructions? Speak, my friend; I listen.”\n\n“There is not a hope,” replied Faria, shaking his head, “but no matter;\nGod wills it that man whom he has created, and in whose heart he has so\nprofoundly rooted the love of life, should do all in his power to\npreserve that existence, which, however painful it may be, is yet\nalways so dear.”\n\n“Oh, yes, yes!” exclaimed Dantès; “and I tell you that I will save you\nyet.”\n\n“Well, then, try.

I am not in love with Mademoiselle\nMercédès; but for you—in the words of the gospel, seek, and you shall\nfind.”\n\n“I have found already.”\n\n“What?”\n\n“I would stab the man, but the woman told me that if any misfortune\nhappened to her betrothed, she would kill herself.”\n\n“Pooh! Women say those things, but never do them.”\n\n“You do not know Mercédès; what she threatens she will do.”\n\n“Idiot!” muttered Danglars; “whether she kill herself or not, what\nmatter, provided Dantès is not captain?”\n\n“Before Mercédès should die,” replied Fernand, with the accents of\nunshaken resolution, “I would die myself!”\n\n“That’s what I call love!” said Caderousse with a voice more tipsy than\never. “That’s love, or I don’t know what love is.”\n\n“Come,” said Danglars, “you appear to me a good sort of fellow, and\nhang me, I should like to help you, but——”\n\n“Yes,” said Caderousse, “but how?”\n\n“My dear fellow,” replied Danglars, “you are three parts drunk; finish\nthe bottle, and you will be completely so.

What could you do against a dozen bandits\nwho spring out of some pit, ruin, or aqueduct, and level their pieces\nat you?”\n\n“Eh, _parbleu!_—they should kill me.”\n\nThe innkeeper turned to Franz with an air that seemed to say, “Your\nfriend is decidedly mad.”\n\n“My dear Albert,” returned Franz, “your answer is sublime, and worthy\nthe ‘_Let him die_,’ of Corneille, only, when Horace made that answer,\nthe safety of Rome was concerned; but, as for us, it is only to gratify\na whim, and it would be ridiculous to risk our lives for so foolish a\nmotive.”\n\nAlbert poured himself out a glass of _lacryma Christi_, which he sipped\nat intervals, muttering some unintelligible words.\n\n“Well, Signor Pastrini,” said Franz, “now that my companion is quieted,\nand you have seen how peaceful my intentions are, tell me who is this\nLuigi Vampa.

I\ndevoted three years of my life to reading and studying these one\nhundred and fifty volumes, till I knew them nearly by heart; so that\nsince I have been in prison, a very slight effort of memory has enabled\nme to recall their contents as readily as though the pages were open\nbefore me.

I know nearly one thousand words, which is all that is\nabsolutely necessary, although I believe there are nearly one hundred\nthousand in the dictionaries. I cannot hope to be very fluent, but I\ncertainly should have no difficulty in explaining my wants and wishes;\nand that would be quite as much as I should ever require.”\n\nStronger grew the wonder of Dantès, who almost fancied he had to do\nwith one gifted with supernatural powers; still hoping to find some\nimperfection which might bring him down to a level with human beings,\nhe added, “Then if you were not furnished with pens, how did you manage\nto write the work you speak of?”\n\n“I made myself some excellent ones, which would be universally\npreferred to all others if once known.

The\ndanger was increasing every moment. Already the broken stakes were\nyielding to the teeth and claws of the wolves. But neither Glenarvan\nnor Thalcave appeared willing to yield. The Indian had drawn Glenarvan\ntowards the entrance of the inclosure. He pointed to the plain, now\nfree from wolves. In his animated language, he explained that not a\nmoment was to be lost; that the danger, if this plan failed, would be\ngreater for those who remained; in short, that he alone knew Thaouka\nwell enough to employ his marvelous agility and speed for the common\nsafety. Glenarvan blindly persisted in his resolve to sacrifice\nhimself, when suddenly he was pushed violently back. Thaouka pranced,\nreared on his hind legs, and all at once, with a spring, cleared the\nbarrier of fire and the rampart of bodies, while a boyish voice cried,--\n\n\"God save you, my lord!\"\n\nGlenarvan and Thalcave had scarcely time to perceive Robert, who,\nclinging to the horse's mane, disappeared in the darkness.\n\n\"Robert, unfortunate!\" cried Glenarvan.\n\nBut these words the Indian himself could not hear. Frightful howls\nresounded. The wolves, starting on the track of the horse, fled into\nthe darkness with a terrible speed.\n\nThalcave and Glenarvan rushed out of the ramada. Already the plain had\nresumed its tranquillity, and they could scarcely distinguish a moving\nline which undulated afar in the shadows of the night.\n\nGlenarvan sank upon the ground, overcome, in despair, clasping his\nhands. He gazed at Thalcave, who smiled with his accustomed calmness.\n\n\"Thaouka--good horse--brave child--he will be saved!\" he repeated,\nnodding his head.\n\n\"But if he falls?\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\"He will not fall!\"\n\nIn spite of Thalcave's confidence, his companion passed the night in\nterrible anguish. He was no longer even mindful of the danger still to\nbe feared from the wolves. He would have gone in search of Robert, but\nthe Indian restrained him, and explained that their horses could not\novertake the boy, that Thaouka must have distanced his enemies, and\ncould not be found in the darkness. They must wait for day to start in\nsearch of Robert.\n\nAt four o'clock in the morning day began to break. The mists of the\nhorizon were soon tinged with pale rays. A sparkling dew covered the\nplain, and the tall grass began to wave under the first breezes of the\ndawn.\n\nThe moment of departure had arrived.\n\n\"Forward!\" said the Indian.\n\nGlenarvan did not reply, but sprang upon Robert's horse, and the two\nwere soon galloping towards the west in the direction from which their\ncompanions were to come.\n\nFor an hour they traveled thus with great speed, gazing around for\nRobert, and dreading at each step to behold his mangled body. Glenarvan\ntortured the flanks of his horse with his spurs. Suddenly shots were\nheard, and reports at regular intervals, like signals for recognition.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"It is they!\" cried Glenarvan.\n\nThalcave and he urged their horses to a more rapid pace, and a few\nmoments afterwards they joined the party led by Paganel.\n\n[Sidenote: LIVELY GRATITUDE.]\n\nTo Glenarvan's joy, Robert was there, alive, borne by the noble\nThaouka, who neighed with pleasure at seeing his master.\n\n\"Ah, my boy! my boy!\" cried Glenarvan, with unspeakable tenderness; and\nRobert and he, dismounting, rushed into each other's arms.\n\nThen it was the Indian's turn to clasp to his breast the courageous son\nof Captain Grant.\n\n\"He lives! he lives!\" exclaimed Glenarvan.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Robert, \"thanks to Thaouka.\"\n\nThe Indian had not waited for these words of gratitude to embrace his\nhorse, but at that very moment he spoke to him and embraced him, as\nif human blood flowed in the veins of the noble animal. Then, turning\ntowards Paganel, he pointed to young Robert.\n\n\"A brave boy!\" said he.\n\nGlenarvan, however, asked, even while he admired the lad,--\n\n\"Why, my son, did you no"}, {"chunk_id": 73, "text": " did not open his lips.\nAs for Thalcave, his Indian pride seemed humbled at having gone astray\non a false trail. No one, however, thought of reproaching him for so\nexcusable an error.\n\nThey returned to the encampment, saddened indeed. Still, not one of\nthe courageous and devoted men regretted so many hardships uselessly\nendured, so many dangers vainly incurred. But each saw all hope of\nsuccess annihilated in an instant. Could they find Captain Grant\nbetween Tandil and the sea? No. If any prisoner had fallen into the\nhands of the Indians on the Atlantic coast, Sergeant Manuel would\ncertainly have been informed. An event of such a nature could not\nhave escaped the natives who trade from Tandil to Carmen. Among the\ntraders of the Argentine Plains everything is known and reported. There\nwas therefore but one course now to take,--to join, without delay, the\nDuncan at Cape Medano, the appointed rendezvous.\n\n[Illustration: More than once during the journey, the attention and\ninterest of all, but especially of Paganel, were arrested by the\ncurious illusion of the mirage.]\n\nIn the meantime, Paganel had asked Glenarvan for the document, by\nrelying on which their search had resulted so unfortunately. He\nread it again with unconcealed vexation, seeking to discover a new\ninterpretation.\n\n\"This document is, at all events, clear,\" said Glenarvan. \"It explains\nin the most definite manner the shipwreck of the captain and the place\nof his captivity.\"\n\n\"No,\" replied the geographer, stamping with his foot, \"a hundred times\nno! Since Captain Grant is not on the Pampas, he is not in America.\nThis document ought to tell where he is; and it shall, my friends, or I\nam no longer Jacques Paganel.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII.\n\nTHE FLOOD.\n\n\n[Sidenote: OMENS AND MIRAGES.]\n\nFort Independence is one hundred and fifty miles from the shores of\nthe Atlantic. But for unforeseen and unexpected delays, Glenarvan\ncould have rejoined the Duncan in four days. He could not, however,\nreconcile himself to the idea of returning on board without Captain\nGrant, and failing so completely in his search; and did not therefore,\nas usual, give the orders for departure. But the major assumed the\ntask of saddling the horses, renewing the provisions, and making his\narrangements for the journey. Thanks to his activity, the little party,\nat eight o'clock in the morning, was on its way down the grassy slopes\nof the Tandil Sierra.\n\nGlenarvan, with Robert at his side, galloped on in silence. His\nlordship's bold and resolute character did not permit him to accept\nthis disappointment calmly. His heart beat violently, and his brain was\non fire. Paganel, tormented by the mystery of the document, arranged\nthe words in every way, as if to draw from them a new meaning. Thalcave\nsilently resigned himself to Thaouka's sagacity. The major, always\nconfident, performed his duties like a man upon whom discouragement can\nhave no effect. Tom Austin and his two sailors shared their master's\nannoyance. Once, when a timid hare crossed the path in front of them,\nthe superstitious Scotchmen gazed at one another.\n\n\"A bad omen,\" said Wilson.\n\n\"Yes, in the Highlands,\" replied Mulready.\n\n\"What is bad in the Highlands is no better here,\" added Wilson,\nsententiously.\n\nAbout noon the travelers had descended the mountains and gained the\nundulating plains that extend to the sea; the boundless prairie spread\nits broad carpet of verdure before them.\n\nMore than once during the journey the attention and interest of all,\nbut especially of Paganel, were arrested by the curious illusion of\nthe mirage, by which was presented in the sky, at the limits of the\nhorizon, a semblance of the estancias, the poplars and willows near\nthem, and other objects; the images being so much like the reality that\nit required a strong effort to realize their deceptive character.\n\nThe weather hitherto had been fine, but now the sky assumed a less\npleasing aspect. Masses of vapor, generated by the high temperature\nof the preceding days, condensed into t"}, {"chunk_id": 38, "text": "him.\n\n\"Have you lost your way?\" he asked.\n\n\"No, my lord,\" replied the catapaz.\n\n\"But we are not at the pass of Antuco?\"\n\n\"We are.\"\n\n\"Are you not mistaken?\"\n\n\"I am not. Here are the remains of a fire made by the Indians, and the\ntracks left by their horses.\"\n\n\"Well, they passed this way?\"\n\n\"Yes; but we cannot. The last earthquake has made it impracticable.\"\n\n\"For mules,\" replied the major; \"but not for men.\"\n\n\"That is for you to decide,\" said the catapaz. \"I have done what I\ncould. My mules and I are ready to turn back, if you please, and search\nfor the other passes of the Andes.\"\n\n\"But that will cause a delay.\"\n\n\"Of three days, at least.\"\n\nGlenarvan listened in silence to the words of the catapaz, who had\nevidently acted in accordance with his engagement. His mules could go\nno farther; but when the proposal was made to retrace their steps,\nGlenarvan turned towards his companions, and said,--\n\n\"Do you wish to go on?\"\n\n\"We will follow you,\" replied Tom Austin.\n\n\"And even precede you,\" added Paganel. \"What is it, after all? To scale\na chain of mountains whose opposite slopes afford an unusually easy\ndescent. This accomplished, we can find the Argentine laqueanos, who\nwill guide us across the Pampas, and swift horses accustomed to travel\nover the plains. Forward, then, without hesitation.\"\n\n\"Forward!\" cried his companions.\n\n\"You do not accompany us?\" said Glenarvan to the catapaz.\n\n\"I am the muleteer,\" he replied.\n\n\"As you say.\"\n\n\"Never mind,\" said Paganel; \"on the other side of this wall we shall\nfind the pass of Antuco again, and I will lead you to the foot of the\nmountain as directly as the best guide of the Andes.\"\n\nGlenarvan accordingly settled with the catapaz, and dismissed him, his\npeons, and his mules. The arms, the instruments, and the remaining\nprovisions, were divided among the seven travelers. By common consent\nit was decided that the ascent should be undertaken immediately, and\nthat, if necessary, they should travel part of the night. Around the\nprecipice to the left wound a steep path that mules could not ascend.\nThe difficulties were great; but, after two hours of fatigue and\nwandering, Glenarvan and his companions found themselves again in the\npass of Antuco.\n\nThey were now in that part of the Andes properly so called, not far\nfrom the main ridge of the mountains; but of the path traced out, of\nthe pass, nothing could be seen. All this region had just been thrown\ninto confusion by the recent earthquakes.\n\nThey ascended all night, climbed almost inaccessible plateaus, and\nleaped over broad and deep crevasses. Their arms took the place of\nropes, and their shoulders served as steps. The strength of Mulready\nand the skill of Wilson were often called into requisition. Many times,\nwithout their devotion and courage, the little party could not have\nadvanced.\n\nGlenarvan never lost sight of young Robert, whose youth and eagerness\nled him to acts of rashness, while Paganel pressed on with all the\nardor of a Frenchman. As for the major, he only moved as much as\nwas necessary, no more, no less, and mounted the path by an almost\ninsensible motion. Did he perceive that he had been ascending\nfor several hours? It is not certain. Perhaps he imagined he was\ndescending.\n\n[Sidenote: PRACTICING \"EXCELSIOR.\"]\n\nAt five o'clock in the morning the travelers had attained a height of\nseven thousand five hundred feet. They were now on the lower ridges,\nthe last limit of arborescent vegetation. At this hour the aspect of\nthese regions was entirely changed. Great blocks of glittering ice, of\na bluish color in certain parts, rose on all sides, and reflected the\nfirst rays of the sun.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe ascent now became very perilous. They no longer advanced without\ncarefully examining the ice. Wilson had taken the lead, and with his\nfoot tested the surface of the glaciers. His companions followed\nexactly in his footsteps, and avoided uttering a word, for the least\nsound might have caused the fall of the snowy masses suspended eight\nhundred "}, {"chunk_id": 45, "text": "han two minutes.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said MacNabb; \"and was Robert on your right, or on your left?\"\n\n\"On my left. I remember that his poncho flapped in my face.\"\n\n\"And where were you situated in reference to us?\"\n\n\"On the left also.\"\n\n\"Then Robert could have disappeared only on this side,\" said the major,\nturning towards the mountain, and pointing to the right. \"And also\nconsidering the time that has elapsed since his disappearance, the\nchild must have fallen at a high part of the mountain. There we must\nsearch, and, by taking different ways, we shall find him.\"\n\nNot a word more was said. The six men, scaling the declivities of the\nmountain, stationed themselves at different heights along the ridge,\nand began their search. They kept always to the right of their line of\ndescent, sounding the smallest fissures, descending to the bottom of\nprecipices half filled with fragments of the mass; and more than one\ncame forth with his garments in shreds, his feet and hands lacerated,\nat the peril of his life.\n\n[Sidenote: A SLEEPLESS NIGHT.]\n\nAll this portion of the Andes, except a few inaccessible plateaus,\nwas carefully explored for many hours without one of these brave men\nthinking of rest. But it was a vain search. The child had not only\nfound death in the mountains, but also a tomb, the stone of which,\nmade of some enormous rock, was forever closed over him.\n\nTowards noon Glenarvan and his companions, bruised and exhausted, found\nthemselves again in the valley. The former was a prey to the most\nviolent grief. He scarcely spoke, and from his lips issued only these\nwords, broken by sighs,--\"I will not go; I will not go!\"\n\nEach understood this determination, and respected it.\n\n\"We will wait,\" said Paganel to the major and Tom Austin. \"Let us take\nsome rest, and recruit our strength. We shall need it, whether to begin\nour search or continue our journey.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied MacNabb, \"let us remain, since Edward wishes it. He\nhopes: but what does he hope?\"\n\n\"God knows!\" said Tom Austin.\n\n\"Poor Robert!\" replied Paganel, wiping his eyes.\n\nTrees thronged the valley in great numbers. The major chose a group of\nlofty carob-trees, under which was established a temporary encampment.\nA few blankets, the arms, a little dried meat, and some rice, was\nall that remained to the travelers. A stream, which flowed not far\noff, furnished water, still muddy from the effects of the avalanche.\nMulready kindled a fire on the grass, and soon presented to his master\na warm and comforting repast. But Glenarvan refused it, and remained\nstretched on his poncho in profound prostration.\n\nThus the day passed. Night came, clear and calm as the preceding. While\nhis companions lay motionless, although wakeful, Glenarvan reascended\nthe mountain. He listened closely, still hoping that a last cry might\nreach him. He ventured alone and afar, pressing his ear to the ground,\nlistening, restraining the beatings of his heart, and calling in a\nvoice of despair.\n\nThe whole night long he wandered on the mountain. Sometimes Paganel,\nsometimes the major, followed him, ready to help him on the slippery\nsummits, or on the edge of the chasms, where his rashness led him. But\nhis last efforts were fruitless; and to the cry of \"Robert! Robert!\" a\nthousand times repeated, echo alone replied.\n\nDay dawned, and it was necessary to go in search of Glenarvan on\nthe mountain, and bring him in spite of his reluctance back to the\nencampment. His despair was terrible. Who would now dare to speak\nto him of departure, and propose leaving this fatal valley? But the\nprovisions were failing. They would soon meet the Argentine guides\nand horses to take them across the Pampas. To retrace their steps was\nmore difficult than to advance. Besides, the Atlantic was the place\nappointed to meet the Duncan. All these reasons did not permit a longer\ndelay, and it was for the interest of all that the hour for departure\nshould be no longer deferred.\n\nMacNabb attempted to draw Glenarvan from his grief. For a long time he\nspoke wit"}, {"chunk_id": 77, "text": "fled away in the track of Thaouka.\n\nIt was time. Five miles to the south a high and broad wall of water\nwas rushing over the plain, which was fast becoming an ocean. The tall\ngrass disappeared as before the scythe, and the tufts of mimosas, torn\nup by the current, separated and formed floating islands. The mass of\nwaters spread itself in broad waves of irresistible power. The dikes of\nthe great rivers had evidently given way, and perhaps the waters of the\nColorado and Rio Negro were now mingling in a common stream.\n\nThe wall of water descried by Thalcave advanced with the speed of a\nrace-horse. The travelers fled before it like a cloud driven by the\nstorm. Their eyes sought in vain a place of refuge. Sky and water\nmingled together on the horizon. The horses, excited by the danger,\ndashed along in a mad gallop, so that their riders could scarcely keep\ntheir seats. Glenarvan frequently glanced behind him.\n\n\"The water is overtaking us,\" he thought.\n\n\"Quick! quick!\" cried Thalcave.\n\n[Sidenote: THE ARK.]\n\nThe unfortunate beasts were urged to a swifter pace. From their flanks,\nlacerated with the spur, flowed bright red streams, which marked\ntheir course on the water by long, crimson lines. They stumbled in\nthe hollows of the ground; they were entangled in the hidden grass;\nthey fell and rose again continually. The depth of the water sensibly\nincreased. Long surges announced the on-rush of the mass of water that\ntossed its foaming crests less than two miles distant.\n\nFor a quarter of an hour this final struggle against the most terrible\nof elements was prolonged. The fugitives could keep no account of the\ndistance they had traversed; but, judging by the rapidity of their\nflight, it must have been considerable.\n\nMeantime the horses, immersed to their breasts, could no longer\nadvance without extreme difficulty. Glenarvan, Paganel, Austin, all\nbelieved themselves lost, victims of the horrible death of unfortunates\nabandoned at sea. Their animals began to lose their footing; six feet\nof water was sufficient to drown them.\n\nWe must forbear to picture the acute anguish of these eight men\novertaken by a rising inundation. They felt their powerlessness to\nstruggle against these convulsions of nature, superior to human\nstrength. Their safety was no longer in their own hands.\n\nFive minutes after, the horses were swimming, while the current alone\ncarried them along with irresistible force and furious swiftness. All\nsafety seemed impossible, when the voice of the major was heard.\n\n\"A tree!\" said he.\n\n\"A tree!\" cried Glenarvan.\n\n\"Yes, yonder!\" replied Thalcave, and he pointed northward to a kind of\ngigantic walnut-tree, which rose solitary from the midst of the waters.\n\nHis companions had no need to be urged. This tree that was opportunely\npresented to them they must reach at all hazards. The horses probably\ncould not accomplish the distance; but the men, at least, could be\nsaved,--the current would carry them.\n\nAt that moment Tom Austin's horse gave a stifled neigh and disappeared.\nHis rider, extricating himself from the stirrups, began to swim\nvigorously.\n\n\"Cling to my saddle!\" cried Glenarvan to him.\n\n\"Thanks, my lord,\" replied he, \"my arms are strong.\"\n\n\"Your horse, Robert?\" continued Glenarvan, turning towards the boy.\n\n\"All right, my lord, all right! He swims like a fish.\"\n\n\"Attention!\" cried the major, in a loud voice.\n\nThis word was scarcely pronounced, when the enormous wall of water\nreached them. A huge wave, forty feet high, overwhelmed the fugitives\nwith a terrible roar. Men and beasts, everything, disappeared in a\nwhirlpool of foam. A ponderous liquid mass engulfed them in its furious\ntide. When the deluge had passed, the men regained the surface, and\nrapidly counted their numbers; but the horses, except Thaouka, had\ndisappeared forever.\n\n\"Courage! courage!\" cried Glenarvan, who supported Paganel with one arm\nand swam with the other.\n\n\"All right! all right!\" replied the worthy geographer; \"indeed I am not\nsorry----\"\n\nWhat was he not "}]}

No one ever knew; for the poor man was\nforced to swallow the end of his sentence in half a pint of muddy water.\n\nThe major calmly advanced, taking a regular stroke of which the most\nskillful swimmer would not have been ashamed. The sailors worked their\nway along like porpoises in their native element. As for Robert, he\nclung to Thaouka's mane, and was thus drawn along. The horse proudly\ncut the waters, and kept himself instinctively on a line with the tree,\ntowards which the current bore him, and which was now not far distant.\n\nIn a few moments the entire party reached it. It was fortunate; for, if\nthis refuge had failed, all chance of safety would have vanished, and\nthey must have perished in the waves. The water was up to the top of\nthe trunk where the main branches grew, so that it was easy to grasp\nthem.\n\nThalcave, leaving his horse, and lifting Robert, seized the first limb,\nand soon his powerful arms had lodged the exhausted swimmers in a place\nof safety. But Thaouka, carried away by the current, was rapidly\ndisappearing. He turned his intelligent head towards his master, and,\nshaking his long mane, neighed for him beseechingly.\n\n[Illustration: A huge wave, forty feet high, overwhelmed the fugitives\nwith a terrible roar.

A ponderous liquid mass engulfed them in its furious\ntide.]\n\n\"Do you abandon him?\" said Paganel.\n\n\"I?\" cried the Indian, and, plunging into the tempestuous waters, he\nreappeared some distance from the tree. A few moments after, his arm\nrested upon the neck of Thaouka, and horse and horseman swam away\ntogether towards the misty horizon of the north.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII.\n\nA SINGULAR ABODE.\n\n\nThe tree upon which Glenarvan and his companions had just found refuge\nresembled a walnut-tree. It had the same shining foliage and rounded\nform. It was the \"ombu,\" which is met with only on the Argentine\nPlains. It had an enormous, twisted trunk, and was confined to the\nearth not only by its great roots, but also by strong shoots which held\nit most tenaciously. It had thus resisted the force of the inundation.\n\n[Sidenote: AN ORNITHOLOGICAL OMNIUM-GATHERUM.]\n\nThis ombu measured one hundred feet in height, and might have covered\nwith its shade a circumference of three hundred and sixty feet. All\nthe upper part rested on three great branches, which forked from the\ntop of the trunk, that was six feet in diameter. Two of these branches\nwere nearly perpendicular, and supported the immense canopy of foliage,\nwhose crossed, twisted, and interlaced limbs, as if woven by the hand\nof a basket-maker, formed an impenetrable shelter. The third branch,\non the contrary, extended almost horizontally over the roaring waters;\nits leaves were bathed in them, while it seemed a promontory to this\nisland of verdure surrounded by an ocean. There was abundant space,\nalso, in the interior of this gigantic tree. The foliage, which was\nnot very dense at its outer circumference, left large openings like\nsky-lights, and made it well ventilated and cool. At sight of these\nbranches rising in innumerable ramifications towards the clouds, while\nthe parasitic convolvuli bound them to each other, and the rays of the\nsun shone through the interstices of the leaves, you would really have\nthought that the trunk of this ombu bore upon itself alone an entire\nforest.\n\nOn the arrival of the fugitives, a feathered population flew away to\nthe top branches, protesting by their cries against so flagran"}, {"chunk_id": 200, "text": "l go first,\" replied Robert. \"I have discovered at the base of\nthe slope a sort of deep excavation, where those who descend first can\nwait for the others in safety.\"\n\n\"Go then, my boy,\" said Glenarvan, clasping the boy's hand.\n\nRobert disappeared through the opening of the grotto. A moment after,\nthree shakes of the rope informed them that he had accomplished his\ndescent successfully.\n\nGlenarvan and Lady Helena now ventured out of the grotto. The\ndarkness below was still profound, but the gray light of dawn was\nalready tinging the top of the mountain. The keen cold of the morning\nreanimated the young wife; she felt stronger, and commenced her\nperilous escape.\n\n[Sidenote: A PRECIPITATE DESCENT.]\n\nFirst her husband, and then she, slid down the rope to the point where\nthe perpendicular wall met the summit of the slope. Then Glenarvan,\ngoing before his wife and assisting her, began to descend the\ndeclivity of the mountain backwards. He sought for tufts of grass and\nbushes that offered a point of support, and tried them before placing\nLady Helena's feet upon them. Several birds, suddenly awakened, flew\naway with shrill cries, and the fugitives shuddered when a large stone\nrolled noisily to the base of the mountain.\n\nThey had accomplished half the distance when a voice was heard at the\nopening of the grotto.\n\n\"Stop!\" whispered Captain Mangles.\n\nGlenarvan, clinging with one hand to a tuft of grass and holding his\nwife with the other, waited, scarcely breathing.\n\nWilson had taken alarm. Hearing some noise outside, he had returned to\nthe hut, and, raising the mat, watched the Maoris. At a sign from him\nthe captain had stopped Glenarvan.\n\nIn truth, one of the warriors, startled by some unaccustomed sound,\nhad risen and approached the prison. Standing two paces from the\nhut, he listened with lowered head. He remained in this attitude\nfor a moment, that seemed an hour, with ear intent and eye on the\nalert. Then, shaking his head as a man who is mistaken, he returned\nto his companions, took an armful of dead wood and threw it on the\nhalf-extinct fire, whose flames revived. His face, brightly illumined\nby the blaze, betrayed no more anxiety, and, after gazing at the first\nglimmers of dawn that tinged the horizon, he stretched himself beside\nthe fire to warm his cold limbs.\n\n\"All right!\" said Wilson.\n\nThe captain made a sign to Glenarvan to continue his descent. The\nlatter, accordingly, slid gently down the slope, and soon Lady Helena\nand he stood on the narrow path where Robert was waiting for them. The\nrope was shaken three times, and next Captain Mangles, followed by Mary\nGrant, took the same perilous course. They were successful, and joined\nLord and Lady Glenarvan.\n\nFive minutes later all the fugitives, after their fortunate escape\nfrom the hut, left this temporary retreat, and, avoiding the inhabited\nshores of the lake, made their way by narrow paths farther down the\nmountain. They advanced rapidly, seeking to avoid all points where they\nmight be seen. They did not speak, but glided like shadows through the\nbushes. Where were they going? At random, it is true, but they were\nfree.\n\nAbout five o'clock day began to break. Purple tints colored the lofty\nbanks of clouds. The mountain peaks emerged from the mists of the\nmorning. The orb of day would not be long in appearing, and instead of\nbeing the signal for torture, was to betray the flight of the condemned.\n\nBefore this dreaded moment arrived it was important that the fugitives\nshould be beyond the reach of the savages. But they could not advance\nquickly, for the paths were steep. Lady Helena scaled the declivities,\nsupported and even carried by Glenarvan, while Mary Grant leaned upon\nthe arm of her betrothed. Robert, happy and triumphant, whose heart was\nfull of joy at his success, took the lead, followed by the two sailors.\n\nFor half an hour the fugitives wandered at a venture. Paganel was not\nthere to guide them,--Paganel, the object of their fears, whose absence\ncast a dark shadow ove"}, {"chunk_id": 50, "text": "lt\nhis wounded limbs. Then, smiling, he went and gathered on the banks\nof the stream a few handfuls of wild celery, with which he rubbed the\nboy's body. Under this treatment, performed with an extreme gentleness,\nthe child felt his strength revive, and it was plain that a few hours\nwould suffice to restore him.\n\nIt was therefore decided that that day and the following night should\nbe passed at the encampment. Besides, two important questions remained\nto be settled--food, and means of conveyance. Provisions and mules were\nboth wanting.\n\nFortunately Thalcave solved the difficulty. This guide, who was\naccustomed to conduct travelers along the Patagonian frontiers, and\nwas one of the most intelligent baqueanos of the country, engaged to\nfurnish Glenarvan all that his little party needed. He offered to take\nhim to a \"tolderia\" (encampment) of Indians, about four miles distant,\nwhere they would find everything necessary for the expedition. This\nproposal was made partly by gestures, partly by Spanish words which\nPaganel succeeded in understanding. It was accepted, and Glenarvan and\nhis learned friend, taking leave of their companions, reascended the\nstream under the guidance of the Patagonian.\n\nThey proceeded at a good pace for an hour and a half, taking long\nstrides to keep up to the giant Thalcave. All the region was charming,\nand of a rich fertility. The grassy pastures succeeded each other,\nand could easily have fed thousands of cattle. Large ponds, united by\na winding chain of streams, gave these plains a verdant moisture.\nBlack-headed swans sported on the mirror-like surface, and disputed the\nempire of the waters with numberless ostriches that gamboled over the\nplains, while the brilliant feathered tribes were in wonderful variety.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nJacques Paganel proceeded from admiration to ecstasy. Exclamations\nof delight continually escaped his lips, to the astonishment of the\nPatagonian, who thought it very natural that there should be birds in\nthe air, swans on the lakes, and grass on the prairies. The geographer\nhad no reason to regret his walk, or complain of its length. He\nscarcely believed himself started, or that the encampment would soon\ncome in sight.\n\nThis tolderia was at the bottom of a narrow valley among the mountains.\nHere in huts of branches lived thirty wandering natives, grazing\nlarge herds of milch cows, sheep, cattle and horses. Thus they roamed\nfrom one pasture to another, always finding a repast ready for their\nfour-footed companions.\n\n[Sidenote: GLENARVAN GOING TO MARKET.]\n\nThalcave took upon himself the negotiation, which was not long. In\nreturn for seven small Argentine horses, all saddled, a hundred pounds\nof dried meat, a few measures of rice, and some leathern bottles for\nwater, the Indians received twenty ounces of gold, the value of which\nthey perfectly understood. Glenarvan would have bought another horse\nfor the Patagonian, but he intimated that it was unnecessary.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe bargain concluded, Glenarvan took leave of his new \"providers,\" as\nPaganel expressed it, and returned to the encampment. His arrival was\nwelcomed by cries of joy at sight of the provisions and horses. Every\none ate with avidity. Robert partook of some nourishment; he had almost\nentirely regained his strength, and the remainder of the day was passed\nin perfect rest. Various subjects were alluded to: the absent dear\nones, the Duncan, Captain Mangles, his brave crew, and Harry Grant who\nwas, perhaps, not far distant.\n\nAs for Paganel, he did not leave the Indian. He became Thalcave's\nshadow, and could not remain quiet in the presence of a real\nPatagonian, in comparison with whom he would have passed for a dwarf.\nHe overwhelmed the grave Indian with Spanish phrases, to which the\nlatter quietly listened. The geographer studied this time without a\nbook, and was often heard repeating words aloud.\n\n\"If I do not get the accent,\" said he to the major, \"you must not be\nangry with me. Who would have thought that one day a Pa"}, {"chunk_id": 65, "text": "van, who was listening with intentness.\n\nBut Thalcave shook his head. He knew well that the animals would not\nabandon a certain prey until at daybreak they returned to their holes\nand dens.\n\nHowever, the tactics of their enemies had evidently changed, they no\nlonger endeavored to force the entrance of the ramada; but their new\nmanoeuvres were already causing a still more imminent danger.\n\nThe wolves, abandoning their design of penetrating the inclosure by\nthis entrance, which was defended by weapon and fire, went to the\nback of the ramada and sought to assail it in the rear. Their claws\nwere soon heard rattling against the half-decayed wood. Already their\npowerful paws and bloody mouths had forced their way between the\nshattered stakes. The horses, bewildered and panic-stricken, broke\ntheir halters and dashed into the inclosure. Glenarvan seized Robert\nin his arms, to defend him to the last extremity; and he would have\nattempted a rash flight, and rushed out of the ramada, had not his eyes\nfallen upon the Indian.\n\nThalcave, turning like a deer, had suddenly approached his horse,\nwhich was neighing with impatience, and was beginning to saddle him\ncarefully, forgetting neither strap nor buckle. He seemed no longer to\ncare for the howls, that were now redoubled. Glenarvan gazed at him\nwith a dark foreboding.\n\n\"He is leaving us!\" cried he, seeing Thalcave gather up his reins as\nthough he were about to mount.\n\n\"He? never!\" said Robert.\n\nIn truth the Indian was about to make a venture, not to leave his\nfriends, but to save them by sacrificing himself. Thaouka was ready.\nHe champed his bit; he pranced; his eyes, full of a fiery spirit, shot\nforth lightning flashes; he understood his master.\n\nJust as the Indian was seizing the mane of his horse, Glenarvan caught\nhim by the arm with a convulsive grasp.\n\n\"You are going?\" said he, pointing to the plain, which was now deserted.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the Indian, who comprehended the gesture of his\ncompanion; and, with vehement gesticulations which were however\nperfectly intelligible, he added a few words in Spanish, which\nsignified: \"Thaouka--good horse--swift--will draw the wolves after him.\"\n\n[Illustration: Frightful howls resounded. The wolves, starting on the\ntrack of the horse, fled into the darkness with a terrible speed.]\n\n\"Ha! Thalcave!\" cried Glenarvan.\n\n\"Quick, quick!\" continued the Indian; while Glenarvan said to Robert,\nin a voice broken by emotion,--\n\n\"Robert, my lad, you hear! He will sacrifice himself for us; he will\nrush out over the plain, and turn aside the fury of the wolves upon\nhimself.\"\n\n\"Friend Thalcave,\" replied Robert, looking imploringly at the\nPatagonian, \"friend Thalcave, do not leave us!\"\n\n\"No,\" said Glenarvan, \"he will not leave us.\"\n\nAnd, turning to the Indian, he added, pointing to the terrified horses\ncrowding against the stakes,--\n\n\"Let us go together.\"\n\n\"No,\" said the Indian, who was not mistaken as to the meaning of these\nwords. \"Bad beasts--frightened--Thaouka--good horse.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Glenarvan. \"Thalcave shall not leave, Robert. He\nshows me what I have to do. It is my duty to go, and his to remain with\nyou.\"\n\nThen, seizing Thaouka's bridle, he added,--\n\n\"I will go.\"\n\n\"No,\" replied the Patagonian, calmly.\n\n\"I tell you,\" cried Glenarvan, taking the bridle from the hands of the\nIndian, \"I will go. Save this boy! I trust him to you, Thalcave!\"\n\nGlenarvan, in his excitement, mingled English and Spanish together. But\nwhat matters the language? In such a terrible situation, signs tell\nall, and men quickly understand each other.\n\n[Sidenote: SAFETY FOR TWO.]\n\nHowever, Thalcave resisted, and the discussion was prolonged. The\ndanger was increasing every moment. Already the broken stakes were\nyielding to the teeth and claws of the wolves. But neither Glenarvan\nnor Thalcave appeared willing to yield. The Indian had drawn Glenarvan\ntowards the entrance of the inclosure. He pointed to the plain, now\nfree from wolves. In his animated language, he explained that not "}, {"chunk_id": 196, "text": "scene of cannibalism, which followed in all\nits horrible details.]\n\n[Illustration: The corpses, folded together, in a sitting posture,\nand tied in their clothes by a girdle of withes, were placed on this\nprimitive bier.]\n\nBut Kai-Koumou had preserved his reason in the midst of the general\nintoxication. He allowed this bloody orgy an hour to reach its utmost\nintensity. The last act of the funeral was played with the usual rites.\n\nThe bodies of Kara-Tété and his wife were taken up, and their limbs\nbent and gathered against the stomach, according to the New Zealand\ncustom. The place for the tomb had been chosen outside of the\nfortification, about two miles distant, on the summit of a small\nmountain, called Maunganamu, situated on the right shore of the lake.\n\nThither the bodies were to be carried. Two very rude palanquins, or\nrather litters, were brought to the foot of the mound. The corpses,\nfolded together, in a sitting posture, and tied in their clothes by a\ngirdle of withes, were placed on this primitive bier. Four warriors\nbore it between them, and the entire tribe, chanting the funeral hymn,\nfollowed them in procession to the place of burial.\n\nThe captives, who were always watched, saw them leave the inner\ninclosure of the pah, and then the songs and cries gradually died away.\nFor about half an hour this funeral escort continued in sight, in the\ndepths of the valley. Finally they perceived it again winding along\nthe mountain paths. The distance gave a fantastic appearance to the\nundulating movements of the long, sinuous column.\n\nThe tribe stopped at the summit of the mountain, which was eight\nhundred feet high, at the place prepared for Kara-Tété's interment.\nA common Maori would have had only a hole and a heap of stones for a\ngrave; but for a powerful and dreaded chief, destined doubtless for a\nspeedy deification, a tomb worthy of his exploits was reserved.\n\n[Sidenote: THE LAST NIGHT.]\n\nThe sepulchre had been surrounded by palisades, while stakes,\nornamented with faces reddened with ochre, stood beside the grave\nwhere the bodies were to lie. The relatives had not forgotten that the\n\"waidoua\" (the spirit of the dead) feeds on substantial nourishment\nlike the body during this perishable life. Food had therefore been\ndeposited in the inclosure, together with the weapons and clothes of\nthe deceased.\n\nNothing was wanting for the comfort of the tomb. Husband and wife were\nlaid side by side, and then covered with earth and grass after a series\nof renewed lamentations. Then the procession silently descended the\nmountain, and now no one could ascend it under penalty of death, for it\nwas tabooed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LI.\n\nSTRANGELY LIBERATED.\n\n\nJust as the sun was disappearing behind Lake Taupo, the captives were\nled back to their prison. They were not to leave it again until the\nsummit of the Wahiti mountains should kindle with the first beams of\nthe day. One night remained to prepare for death. In spite of the\nfaintness, in spite of the horror with which they were seized, they\nshared their repast in common.\n\n\"We shall need all the strength possible to face death,\" said\nGlenarvan. \"We must show these barbarians how Europeans and Christians\ncan die.\"\n\nThe meal being finished, Lady Helena repeated the evening prayer aloud,\nwhile all her companions, with uncovered heads, joined her. Having\nfulfilled this duty, and enjoyed this privilege, the prisoners embraced\neach other. Lady Helena and Mary Grant then retired to one corner of\nthe hut, and stretched themselves upon a mat. Sleep, which soothes all\nwoes, soon closed their eyes, and they slumbered in each other's arms,\novercome by fatigue and long wakefulness.\n\nGlenarvan, taking his friends aside, said:\n\n\"My dear companions, our lives and those of these poor ladies are in\nGod's hands.

The horses, overcome with fatigue, had lain down on the ground:\nThaouka alone, like a true blooded horse, slept standing, spirited in\nrepose as in action, and ready to start at the least sign from his\nmaster. Perfect tranquillity reigned within the inclosure, and the\nembers of the night-fire, as they gradually died out, cast their last\nrays over the silent obscurity.\n\nAbout ten o'clock, after a short sleep, the Indian awoke. His eyes\nbecame fixed beneath his lowered eyebrows, and his head was turned in a\nlistening attitude towards the plain. He seemed endeavoring to detect\nsome scarcely perceptible sound. A vague uneasiness was soon expressed\non his face, usually so calm. Had he perceived the approach of prowling\nIndians, or the coming of jaguars, water-tigers, and other formidable\nbeasts which are numerous in the neighborhood of rivers? This last\npossibility doubtless appeared plausible to him, for he cast a rapid\nglance over the combustible materials piled in the inclosure, and his\nanxiety increased. In fact, all this dry bedding would quickly be\nconsumed, and could not long intimidate the audacious animals.\n\nAccording to this conjecture, Thalcave had only to await the progress\nof events, which he did, half reclining, his head resting on his hands,\nhis elbows on his knees, his eyes motionless, in the attitude of a man\nwhom a sudden anxiety has awakened from sleep.\n\nAn hour passed. Any other person but Thalcave, reassured by the outward\nsilence, would have lain down again. But where a stranger would have\nsuspected nothing, the highly-trained senses and natural instinct of\nthe Indian foresaw the coming danger.\n\nWhile he was listening and watching, Thaouka gave a low neigh. His\nnose was stretched towards the entrance to the ramada. The Patagonian\nsuddenly started.\n\n\"Thaouka has scented some enemy,\" said he.\n\nHe arose and scanned the plain attentively. Silence still reigned, but\nnot tranquillity. Thalcave discerned shadows moving noiselessly among\nthe tufts of grass. Here and there glittered luminous points, which\nspread on all sides, now fading away, and now gleaming forth again. You\nwould have thought fantastic elves were dancing on the surface of an\nimmense lagoon. A stranger would doubtless have taken these flitting\nsparks for glow-worms, which shine, when night comes, in many parts of\nthe Pampas. But Thalcave was not deceived; he knew with what enemies he\nhad to deal. He loaded his carbine, and took a position near the first\nstakes of the inclosure.\n\nHe did not wait long. A strange cry, a mingling of barks and howls,\nresounded over the plain. The report of the carbine answered it,\nand was followed by a hundred frightful yelps. Glenarvan and Robert\nsuddenly awoke.\n\n[Sidenote: FEARFUL ODDS.]\n\n\"What is the matter?\" asked Robert.\n\n\"Indians?\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\"No,\" replied Thalcave, \"aguaras.\"\n\nRobert looked at Glenarvan.\n\n\"Aguaras?\" said he.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Glenarvan, \"the red wolves of the Pampas.\"\n\nBoth seized their weapons, and joined the Indian. The latter pointed\nto the plain, from which arose a series of formidable howls. Robert\ninvoluntarily took a step backward.\n\n\"You are not afraid of the wolves, my boy?\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\"No, my lord,\" replied Robert, in a firm tone. \"With you I fear\nnothing.\"\n\n\"So much the better. These aguaras are not very formidable beasts; and\nwere it not for their numbers I should not even think of them.\"\n\n\"What does it matter?\" replied Robert. \"We are well armed. Let them\ncome.\"\n\n\"And they shall be well received.\"\n\nSpeaking thus, Glenarvan endeavored to reassure the lad; but he did\nnot think without a secret terror of that dense horde of exasperated\nbeasts. Perhaps there were hundreds of them; and these three, however\nwell armed, could not advantageously contend against so many and such\nantagonists.\n\nBy the howls that resounded over the Pampas, and by the multi"}, {"chunk_id": 39, "text": "nged. Great blocks of glittering ice, of\na bluish color in certain parts, rose on all sides, and reflected the\nfirst rays of the sun.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe ascent now became very perilous. They no longer advanced without\ncarefully examining the ice. Wilson had taken the lead, and with his\nfoot tested the surface of the glaciers. His companions followed\nexactly in his footsteps, and avoided uttering a word, for the least\nsound might have caused the fall of the snowy masses suspended eight\nhundred feet above their heads.\n\nThey had reached the region of shrubs, which, four hundred and fifty\nfeet higher, gave place to grass and cactuses. At eleven thousand feet\nall traces of vegetation disappeared. The travelers had stopped only\nonce to recruit their strength by a hasty repast, and with superhuman\ncourage they resumed the ascent in the face of the ever-increasing\ndangers.\n\n[Illustration: Two hours more of terrible exertion followed. They kept\nascending, in order to reach the highest summit of this part of the\nmountain.]\n\n[Sidenote: SOMEWHAT SERIOUS.]\n\nThe strength of the little troop, however, in spite of their courage,\nwas almost gone. Glenarvan, seeing the exhaustion of his companions,\nregretted having engaged in the undertaking. Young Robert struggled\nagainst fatigue, but could go no farther.\n\nGlenarvan stopped.\n\n\"We must take a rest,\" said he, for he clearly saw that no one else\nwould make this proposal.\n\n\"Take a rest?\" replied Paganel; \"how? where? we have no shelter.\"\n\n\"It is indispensable, if only for Robert.\"\n\n\"No, my lord,\" replied the courageous child; \"I can still walk--do not\nstop.\"\n\n\"We will carry you, my boy,\" said Paganel, \"but we must, at all\nhazards, reach the eastern slope. There, perhaps, we shall find some\nhut in which we can take refuge. I ask for two hours more of travel.\"\n\n\"Do you all agree?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied his companions.\n\n\"I will take charge of the brave boy,\" added the equally brave Mulready.\n\nThey resumed their march towards the east. Two hours more of terrible\nexertion followed. They kept ascending, in order to reach the highest\nsummit of this part of the mountain.\n\nWhatever were the desires of these courageous men, the moment now came\nwhen the most valiant failed, and dizziness, that terrible malady of\nthe mountains, exhausted not only their physical strength but their\nmoral courage. It is impossible to struggle with impunity against\nfatigues of this kind. Soon falls became frequent, and those who fell\ncould only advance by dragging themselves on their knees.\n\nExhaustion was about to put an end to this too prolonged ascent; and\nGlenarvan was considering with terror the extent of the snow, the cold\nwhich in this fatal region was so much to be dreaded, the shadows that\nwere deepening on the solitary peaks, and the absence of a shelter for\nthe night, when the major stopped him, and, in a calm tone, said,--\n\n\"A hut!\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\nA SUDDEN DESCENT.\n\n\nAny one but MacNabb would have passed by, around, or even over this\nhut a hundred times without suspecting its existence. A projection on\nthe surface of the snow scarcely distinguished it from the surrounding\nrocks. It was necessary to uncover it; after half an hour of persistent\nlabor, Wilson and Mulready had cleared away the entrance to the\n\"casucha,\" and the little party stepped in.\n\n[Sidenote: A \"RESTAURANT\" REOPENED.]\n\nThis casucha, constructed by the Indians, was made of adobes, a kind\nof bricks dried in the sun. Ten persons could easily find room inside,\nand, if its walls had not been sufficiently water-tight in the rainy\nseason, at this time, at least, they were some protection against the\nseverity of the cold. There was, besides, a sort of fireplace with a\nflue of bricks very poorly laid, which enabled them to kindle a fire,\nand thus withstand the external temperature.\n\n\"Here is a shelter, at least,\" said Glenarvan, \"even if it is not\ncomfortable. Providence has led us hither, and we cannot do better than\naccept t"}, {"chunk_id": 4, "text": "Edward!\" cried Lady Glenarvan.\n\nIt was difficult to proceed in any other way, and, at all hazards,\nGlenarvan determined to break the neck of the precious bottle. It was\nnecessary to use a hammer, for the stony covering had acquired the\nhardness of granite. The fragments soon strewed the table, and several\npieces of paper were perceived adhering to each other. Glenarvan drew\nthem out carefully, separating and examining them closely, while Lady\nHelena, the major, and the captain crowded around him.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nTHE THREE DOCUMENTS.\n\n\nThese pieces of paper, half destroyed by the sea-water, exhibited only\na few words, the traces of handwriting almost entirely effaced. For\nseveral minutes Lord Glenarvan examined them attentively, turned them\nabout in every way, and exposed them to the light of day, observing\nthe least traces of writing spared by the sea. Then he looked at his\nfriends, who were regarding him with anxious eyes.\n\n\"There are here,\" said he, \"three distinct documents, probably three\ncopies of the same missive, translated into three different languages:\none English, another French, and the third German. The few words that\nremain leave no doubt on this point.\"\n\n\"But these words have at least a meaning?\" said Lady Glenarvan.\n\n\"That is difficult to say, my dear Helena. The words traced on these\npapers are very imperfect.\"\n\n\"Perhaps they will complete each other,\" said the major.\n\n\"That may be,\" replied Captain Mangles. \"It is not probable that the\nwater has obliterated these lines in exactly the same places on each,\nand by comparing these remains of phrases we shall arrive at some\nintelligible meaning.\"\n\n\"We will do so,\" said Lord Glenarvan; \"but let us proceed\nsystematically. And, first, here is the English document.\"\n\nIt showed the following arrangement of lines and words:\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"That does not mean much,\" said the major, with an air of\ndisappointment.\n\n\"Whatever it may mean,\" replied the captain, \"it is good English.\"\n\n\"There is no doubt of that,\" said his lordship. \"The words _wreck,\naland, this, and, lost_, are perfect. _Cap_ evidently means _captain_,\nreferring to the captain of a shipwrecked vessel.\"\n\n\"Let us add,\" said the captain, \"the portions of the words _docu_ and\n_ssistance_, the meaning of which is plain.\"\n\n\"Well, something is gained already!\" added Lady Helena.\n\n\"Unfortunately,\" replied the major, \"entire lines are wanting. How can\nwe find the name of the lost vessel, or the place of shipwreck?\"\n\n\"We shall find them,\" said Lord Edward.\n\n\"Very likely,\" answered the major, who was invariably of the opinion of\nevery one else; \"but how?\"\n\n\"By comparing one document with another.\"\n\n\"Let us see!\" cried Lady Helena.\n\nThe second piece of paper, more damaged than the former, exhibited only\nisolated words, arranged thus:\n\n[Sidenote: COMPARATIVE PHILOLOGY.]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"This is written in German,\" said Captain Mangles, when he had cast his\neyes upon it.\n\n\"And do you know that language?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"Perfectly, your lordship.\"\n\n\"Well, tell us what these few words mean.\"\n\nThe captain examined the document closely, and expressed himself as\nfollows:\n\n\"First, the date of the event is determined. _7 Juni_ means June 7th,\nand by comparing this figure with the figures '62,' furnished by the\nEnglish document, we have the date complete,--June 7th, 1862.\"\n\n\"Very well!\" exclaimed Lady Helena. \"Go on.\"\n\n\"On the same line,\" continued the young captain, \"I find the word\n_Glas_, which, united with the word _gow_ of the first document, gives\n_Glasgow_. It is plainly a ship from the port of Glasgow.\"\n\n\"That was my opinion,\" said the major.\n\n\"The second line is missing entirely,\" continued Captain Mangles; \"but\non the third I meet with two important words _zwei_, which means _two_,\nand _atrosen_, or rather _matrosen_, which signifies _sailors_ in\nGerman.\"\n\n\"There were a captain and two sailors, then?\" said Lady Helena.\n\n\"Probably,\" replied her husband.\n\n\"I will confess, your lordship,\" said the ca"}, {"chunk_id": 38, "text": "him.\n\n\"Have you lost your way?\" he asked.\n\n\"No, my lord,\" replied the catapaz.\n\n\"But we are not at the pass of Antuco?\"\n\n\"We are.\"\n\n\"Are you not mistaken?\"\n\n\"I am not. Here are the remains of a fire made by the Indians, and the\ntracks left by their horses.\"\n\n\"Well, they passed this way?\"\n\n\"Yes; but we cannot. The last earthquake has made it impracticable.\"\n\n\"For mules,\" replied the major; \"but not for men.\"\n\n\"That is for you to decide,\" said the catapaz. \"I have done what I\ncould. My mules and I are ready to turn back, if you please, and search\nfor the other passes of the Andes.\"\n\n\"But that will cause a delay.\"\n\n\"Of three days, at least.\"\n\nGlenarvan listened in silence to the words of the catapaz, who had\nevidently acted in accordance with his engagement. His mules could go\nno farther; but when the proposal was made to retrace their steps,\nGlenarvan turned towards his companions, and said,--\n\n\"Do you wish to go on?\"\n\n\"We will follow you,\" replied Tom Austin.\n\n\"And even precede you,\" added Paganel. \"What is it, after all? To scale\na chain of mountains whose opposite slopes afford an unusually easy\ndescent. This accomplished, we can find the Argentine laqueanos, who\nwill guide us across the Pampas, and swift horses accustomed to travel\nover the plains. Forward, then, without hesitation.\"\n\n\"Forward!\" cried his companions.\n\n\"You do not accompany us?\" said Glenarvan to the catapaz.\n\n\"I am the muleteer,\" he replied.\n\n\"As you say.\"\n\n\"Never mind,\" said Paganel; \"on the other side of this wall we shall\nfind the pass of Antuco again, and I will lead you to the foot of the\nmountain as directly as the best guide of the Andes.\"\n\nGlenarvan accordingly settled with the catapaz, and dismissed him, his\npeons, and his mules. The arms, the instruments, and the remaining\nprovisions, were divided among the seven travelers. By common consent\nit was decided that the ascent should be undertaken immediately, and\nthat, if necessary, they should travel part of the night. Around the\nprecipice to the left wound a steep path that mules could not ascend.\nThe difficulties were great; but, after two hours of fatigue and\nwandering, Glenarvan and his companions found themselves again in the\npass of Antuco.\n\nThey were now in that part of the Andes properly so called, not far\nfrom the main ridge of the mountains; but of the path traced out, of\nthe pass, nothing could be seen. All this region had just been thrown\ninto confusion by the recent earthquakes.\n\nThey ascended all night, climbed almost inaccessible plateaus, and\nleaped over broad and deep crevasses. Their arms took the place of\nropes, and their shoulders served as steps. The strength of Mulready\nand the skill of Wilson were often called into requisition. Many times,\nwithout their devotion and courage, the little party could not have\nadvanced.\n\nGlenarvan never lost sight of young Robert, whose youth and eagerness\nled him to acts of rashness, while Paganel pressed on with all the\nardor of a Frenchman. As for the major, he only moved as much as\nwas necessary, no more, no less, and mounted the path by an almost\ninsensible motion. Did he perceive that he had been ascending\nfor several hours? It is not certain. Perhaps he imagined he was\ndescending.\n\n[Sidenote: PRACTICING \"EXCELSIOR.\"]\n\nAt five o'clock in the morning the travelers had attained a height of\nseven thousand five hundred feet. They were now on the lower ridges,\nthe last limit of arborescent vegetation. At this hour the aspect of\nthese regions was entirely changed. Great blocks of glittering ice, of\na bluish color in certain parts, rose on all sides, and reflected the\nfirst rays of the sun.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe ascent now became very perilous. They no longer advanced without\ncarefully examining the ice. Wilson had taken the lead, and with his\nfoot tested the surface of the glaciers. His companions followed\nexactly in his footsteps, and avoided uttering a word, for the least\nsound might have caused the fall of the snowy masses suspended eight\nhundred "}, {"chunk_id": 26, "text": "ay was\nsheltered from the winds. The rain fell in torrents so that they could\nscarcely see the city, which was on an elevated plain in the form of a\nterrace, resting on volcanic rocks three hundred feet in height. The\nappearance of the island through this rainy curtain was misty.\n\nShipping the coal was not accomplished without great difficulty, and\nthe passengers saw themselves confined to the cabin, while sea and\nsky mingled their waters in an indescribable tumult. The weather was,\ntherefore, the topic of conversation on board. Each one had his say\nexcept the major, who would have witnessed the deluge itself with\nperfect indifference. Paganel walked to and fro, shaking his head.\n\n\"It is an imperative fact,\" said he.\n\n\"It is certain,\" replied Glenarvan, \"that the elements declare\nthemselves against you.\"\n\n\"I will see about that.\"\n\n\"You cannot face such a storm,\" said Lady Helena.\n\n\"I, madam? Certainly. I fear only for my baggage and instruments. They\nwill all be lost.\"\n\n\"Our landing is the only thing doubtful,\" resumed Glenarvan. \"Once\nat Villa-Praïa, you will not have very uncomfortable quarters; rather\nuncleanly, to be sure, in the company of monkeys and swine, whose\nsurroundings are not always agreeable; but a traveler does not regard\nthat so critically. Besides, you can hope in seven or eight months to\nembark for Europe.\"\n\n\"Seven or eight months!\" exclaimed Paganel.\n\n\"At least that. The Cape Verd Islands are very rarely frequented\nduring the rainy season. But you can employ your time profitably. This\narchipelago is still little known. There is much to do, even now.\"\n\n\"But,\" replied Paganel in a pitiful tone, \"what could I do after the\ninvestigations of the geologist Deville?\"\n\n\"That is really a pity,\" said Lady Helena. \"What will become of you,\nMonsieur Paganel?\"\n\nPaganel was silent for a few moments.\n\n\"You had decidedly better have landed at Madeira,\" rejoined Glenarvan,\n\"although there is no wine there.\"\n\n\"My dear Glenarvan,\" continued Paganel at last, \"where shall you land\nnext?\"\n\n\"At Concepcion.\"\n\n\"Alas! but that would bring me directly away from India!\"\n\n\"No; for when you have passed Cape Horn you approach the Indies.\"\n\n\"I very much doubt it.\"\n\n\"Besides,\" continued Glenarvan with the greatest gravity, \"as long as\nyou are at the Indies, what difference does it make whether they are\nthe East or the West?\"\n\n\"'What difference does it make'?\"\n\n\"The inhabitants of the Pampas of Patagonia are Indians as well as the\nnatives of the Punjab.\"\n\n\"Eh! my lord,\" exclaimed Paganel, \"that is a reason I should never have\nimagined!\"\n\n[Sidenote: BAIT FOR A TRAVELLER.]\n\n\"And then, my dear Paganel, you know that you can gain the gold medal\nin any country whatever.

He came out of his examination very creditably; the\nreverence with which he spoke of the Creator and of the Bible produced\na very favorable impression on the Scottish heads of the expedition,\nwhilst the fact that he had taken \"the first prize in geography\" was\nsufficient introduction to Monsieur Paganel, who forthwith tested his\nknowledge, greatly to his own satisfaction, and considerably to the\ncredit of his young pupil. The curiosity of his discoverers having been\nfully satisfied, Toliné was made welcome, and partook with the others\nof the general repast. Many were the plans and purposes concerning\nhim, and much wonder was expressed as to how they could speed him on\nhis way; but in the morning it was discovered that he had solved the\nproblem for himself, and a bouquet of fresh leaves and flowers, laid by\nthe side of Lady Helena's seat, was the only memento that Toliné had\nleft.\n\n[Sidenote: A GOLDEN CITY.]\n\nThe party were now approaching the district which, in the years 1851\nand 1852, was so much talked of throughout the civilized world,\nand attracted from all parts so many reckless adventurers and\nfortune-hunters. The line of the thirty-seventh parallel, on which they\nwere traveling, led them through the diggings and municipality of Mount\nAlexander, which was one of the most successful spots for the digger at\nthe commencement of the gold fever, in consequence of the comparatively\nlevel nature of the ground and the general richness of the soil, so\ndifferent from some other localities where only once in a while was\nsome enormous nugget to be found. As they drew near to the streets of\nthis hastily-built town, Ayrton and Mulready, who were in charge of the\ncart, were sent forward, whilst the others walked through the place to\ninspect what there might be of interest, as well as to ascertain what\nmight be learned concerning the object of their expedition.\n\nThus, in this strange gathering of all nationalities and creeds and\nprofessions, the regular inhabitants beheld a still more extraordinary\nsight than that every day afforded them: folks who to the refinement\nwhich education and civilization give added both the earnestness\nof the worker and the freshness and vigor of the pleasure-seeking\ntourist. In the streets, in connection with the strange sign-boards and\nannouncements, the novel erections and purposes to which some of them\nwere adapted, Paganel had a history and commentary for every one.\n\nStill more did he expatiate upon the thousand-and-one topics of\ninterest when they visited the bank building, which here is the\ncentre of more than one agency connected with this great gold-bearing\ndistrict. Here was the mineralogical museum, in which might be seen\nspecimens illustrative of all the various ways in which the gold has\nbeen found, whether in combination with clay or other minerals, or--as\nit is sometimes, to the great joy of the finder, discovered--_pur\net simple_. Here also were models, diagrams, and even the tools\nthemselves, to illustrate the different methods by which the object\nof search was dug out, or washed, or crushed, or tested. Here also\nwas an almost unequaled collection of precious stones, gems of all\nsorts, making the gallery in which they were placed a real Golconda\nfor its wealth and attractions. Besides all this, here was the centre\nof the varied agencies by which the reports were brought in from the\ncompanies established for mining purposes, and also from each isolated\nworker, of the space purchased, the number of feet or yards dug, the\nore extracted, the comparative richness or poverty of the soil here,\nthere, and elsewhere, which in their summarized and aggregate form have\ngreatly helped to a correct knowledge of the comparative and absolute\ngold-"}, {"chunk_id": 77, "text": "fled away in the track of Thaouka.\n\nIt was time. Five miles to the south a high and broad wall of water\nwas rushing over the plain, which was fast becoming an ocean. The tall\ngrass disappeared as before the scythe, and the tufts of mimosas, torn\nup by the current, separated and formed floating islands. The mass of\nwaters spread itself in broad waves of irresistible power. The dikes of\nthe great rivers had evidently given way, and perhaps the waters of the\nColorado and Rio Negro were now mingling in a common stream.\n\nThe wall of water descried by Thalcave advanced with the speed of a\nrace-horse. The travelers fled before it like a cloud driven by the\nstorm. Their eyes sought in vain a place of refuge. Sky and water\nmingled together on the horizon. The horses, excited by the danger,\ndashed along in a mad gallop, so that their riders could scarcely keep\ntheir seats. Glenarvan frequently glanced behind him.\n\n\"The water is overtaking us,\" he thought.\n\n\"Quick! quick!\" cried Thalcave.\n\n[Sidenote: THE ARK.]\n\nThe unfortunate beasts were urged to a swifter pace. From their flanks,\nlacerated with the spur, flowed bright red streams, which marked\ntheir course on the water by long, crimson lines. They stumbled in\nthe hollows of the ground; they were entangled in the hidden grass;\nthey fell and rose again continually. The depth of the water sensibly\nincreased. Long surges announced the on-rush of the mass of water that\ntossed its foaming crests less than two miles distant.\n\nFor a quarter of an hour this final struggle against the most terrible\nof elements was prolonged. The fugitives could keep no account of the\ndistance they had traversed; but, judging by the rapidity of their\nflight, it must have been considerable.\n\nMeantime the horses, immersed to their breasts, could no longer\nadvance without extreme difficulty. Glenarvan, Paganel, Austin, all\nbelieved themselves lost, victims of the horrible death of unfortunates\nabandoned at sea. Their animals began to lose their footing; six feet\nof water was sufficient to drown them.\n\nWe must forbear to picture the acute anguish of these eight men\novertaken by a rising inundation. They felt their powerlessness to\nstruggle against these convulsions of nature, superior to human\nstrength. Their safety was no longer in their own hands.\n\nFive minutes after, the horses were swimming, while the current alone\ncarried them along with irresistible force and furious swiftness. All\nsafety seemed impossible, when the voice of the major was heard.\n\n\"A tree!\" said he.\n\n\"A tree!\" cried Glenarvan.\n\n\"Yes, yonder!\" replied Thalcave, and he pointed northward to a kind of\ngigantic walnut-tree, which rose solitary from the midst of the waters.\n\nHis companions had no need to be urged. This tree that was opportunely\npresented to them they must reach at all hazards. The horses probably\ncould not accomplish the distance; but the men, at least, could be\nsaved,--the current would carry them.\n\nAt that moment Tom Austin's horse gave a stifled neigh and disappeared.\nHis rider, extricating himself from the stirrups, began to swim\nvigorously.\n\n\"Cling to my saddle!\" cried Glenarvan to him.\n\n\"Thanks, my lord,\" replied he, \"my arms are strong.\"\n\n\"Your horse, Robert?\" continued Glenarvan, turning towards the boy.\n\n\"All right, my lord, all right! He swims like a fish.\"\n\n\"Attention!\" cried the major, in a loud voice.\n\nThis word was scarcely pronounced, when the enormous wall of water\nreached them. A huge wave, forty feet high, overwhelmed the fugitives\nwith a terrible roar. Men and beasts, everything, disappeared in a\nwhirlpool of foam. A ponderous liquid mass engulfed them in its furious\ntide. When the deluge had passed, the men regained the surface, and\nrapidly counted their numbers; but the horses, except Thaouka, had\ndisappeared forever.\n\n\"Courage! courage!\" cried Glenarvan, who supported Paganel with one arm\nand swam with the other.\n\n\"All right! all right!\" replied the worthy geographer; \"indeed I am not\nsorry----\"\n\nWhat was he not "}, {"chunk_id": 30, "text": "eets had grown into prairies. There was no\ncommerce, no activity, no business. The mandolin resounded from every\nbalcony, languishing songs issued from the lattices of the windows, and\nConcepcion, the ancient city of men, had become a village of women and\nchildren.\n\nGlenarvan appeared little desirous of seeking the causes of this\ndecline--though Jacques Paganel attacked him on this subject--and,\nwithout losing an instant, betook himself to the house of J. R.\nBentock, Esq., consul of Her Britannic Majesty. This individual\nreceived him very courteously, and when he learned the story of Captain\nGrant undertook to search along the entire coast.\n\nThe question whether the Britannia had been wrecked on the shores of\nChili or Araucania was decided in the negative. No report of such an\nevent had come either to the consul, or his colleagues in other parts\nof the country.\n\nBut Glenarvan was not discouraged. He returned to Talcahuana, and,\nsparing neither fatigue, trouble, or money, he sent men to the coast,\nbut their search was in vain. The most minute inquiries among the\npeople of the vicinity were of no avail. They were forced to conclude\nthat the Britannia had left no trace of her shipwreck.\n\n[Illustration: In Concepcion.]\n\n[Sidenote: \"TRY AGAIN!\"]\n\nGlenarvan then informed his companions of the failure of his endeavors.\nMary Grant and her brother could not restrain their grief. It was now\nsix days since the arrival of the Duncan at Talcahuana. The passengers\nwere together in the cabin. Lady Helena was consoling, not by her\nwords--for what could she say?--but by her caresses, the two children\nof the captain. Jacques Paganel had taken up the document again, and\nwas regarding it with earnest attention, as if he would have drawn from\nit new secrets. For an hour he had examined it thus, when Glenarvan,\naddressing him, said,--\n\n\"Paganel, I appeal to your sagacity. Is the interpretation we have made\nof this document incorrect? Is the sense of these words illogical?\"\n\nPaganel did not answer. He was reflecting.\n\n\"Are we mistaken as to the supposed scene of the shipwreck?\" continued\nGlenarvan. \"Does not the name Patagonia suggest itself at once to the\nmind?\"\n\nPaganel was still silent.\n\n\"In short,\" said Glenarvan, \"does not the word _Indian_ justify us\nstill more?\"\n\n\"Perfectly,\" replied MacNabb.\n\n\"And therefore, is it not evident that these shipwrecked men, when they\nwrote these lines, expected to be prisoners of the Indians?\"\n\n\"There you are wrong, my dear lord,\" said Paganel, at last; \"and if\nyour other conclusions are just, the last at least does not seem to me\nrational.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Lady Helena, while all eyes were turned\ntowards the geographer.\n\n\"I mean,\" answered Paganel, emphasizing his words, \"that Captain Grant\nis _now prisoner of the Indians_: and I will add that the document\nleaves no doubt on this point.\"\n\n\"Explain yourself, sir,\" said Miss Grant.\n\n\"Nothing is easier, my dear Mary. Instead of reading _they will be\nprisoners_, read _they are prisoners_, and all will be clear.\"\n\n\"But that is impossible,\" replied Glenarvan.\n\n\"Impossible? And why, my noble friend?\" asked Paganel, smiling.\n\n\"Because the bottle must have been thrown when the vessel was breaking\non the rocks. Hence the degrees of longitude and latitude apply to the\nvery place of shipwreck.\"\n\n\"Nothing proves it,\" said Paganel, earnestly; \"and I do not see why\nthe shipwrecked sailors, after being carried by the Indians into the\ninterior of the country, could not have sought to make known by means\nof this bottle the place of their captivity.\"\n\n\"Simply, my dear Paganel, because to throw a bottle into the sea it is\nnecessary, at least, that the sea should be before you.\"\n\n\"Or, in the absence of the sea,\" added Paganel, \"the rivers which flow\ninto it.\"\n\nAn astonished silence followed this unexpected, yet reasonable, answer.\nBy the flash that brightened the eyes of his hearers Paganel knew that\neach of them had conceived a new hope.

They no longer advanced without\ncarefully examining the ice. Wilson had taken the lead, and with his\nfoot tested the surface of the glaciers. His companions followed\nexactly in his footsteps, and avoided uttering a word, for the least\nsound might have caused the fall of the snowy masses suspended eight\nhundred feet above their heads.\n\nThey had reached the region of shrubs, which, four hundred and fifty\nfeet higher, gave place to grass and cactuses. At eleven thousand feet\nall traces of vegetation disappeared. The travelers had stopped only\nonce to recruit their strength by a hasty repast, and with superhuman\ncourage they resumed the ascent in the face of the ever-increasing\ndangers.\n\n[Illustration: Two hours more of terrible exertion followed. They kept\nascending, in order to reach the highest summit of this part of the\nmountain.]\n\n[Sidenote: SOMEWHAT SERIOUS.]\n\nThe strength of the little troop, however, in spite of their courage,\nwas almost gone. Glenarvan, seeing the exhaustion of his companions,\nregretted having engaged in the undertaking. Young Robert struggled\nagainst fatigue, but could go no farther.\n\nGlenarvan stopped.\n\n\"We must take a rest,\" said he, for he clearly saw that no one else\nwould make this proposal.\n\n\"Take a rest?\" replied Paganel; \"how? where? we have no shelter.\"\n\n\"It is indispensable, if only for Robert.\"\n\n\"No, my lord,\" replied the courageous child; \"I can still walk--do not\nstop.\"\n\n\"We will carry you, my boy,\" said Paganel, \"but we must, at all\nhazards, reach the eastern slope. There, perhaps, we shall find some\nhut in which we can take refuge. I ask for two hours more of travel.\"\n\n\"Do you all agree?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied his companions.\n\n\"I will take charge of the brave boy,\" added the equally brave Mulready.\n\nThey resumed their march towards the east. Two hours more of terrible\nexertion followed. They kept ascending, in order to reach the highest\nsummit of this part of the mountain.\n\nWhatever were the desires of these courageous men, the moment now came\nwhen the most valiant failed, and dizziness, that terrible malady of\nthe mountains, exhausted not only their physical strength but their\nmoral courage. It is impossible to struggle with impunity against\nfatigues of this kind. Soon falls became frequent, and those who fell\ncould only advance by dragging themselves on their knees.\n\nExhaustion was about to put an end to this too prolonged ascent; and\nGlenarvan was considering with terror the extent of the snow, the cold\nwhich in this fatal region was so much to be dreaded, the shadows that\nwere deepening on the solitary peaks, and the absence of a shelter for\nthe night, when the major stopped him, and, in a calm tone, said,--\n\n\"A hut!\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\nA SUDDEN DESCENT.\n\n\nAny one but MacNabb would have passed by, around, or even over this\nhut a hundred times without suspecting its existence. A projection on\nthe surface of the snow scarcely distinguished it from the surrounding\nrocks. It was necessary to uncover it; after half an hour of persistent\nlabor, Wilson and Mulready had cleared away the entrance to the\n\"casucha,\" and the little party stepped in.\n\n[Sidenote: A \"RESTAURANT\" REOPENED.]\n\nThis casucha, constructed by the Indians, was made of adobes, a kind\nof bricks dried in the sun. Ten persons could easily find room inside,\nand, if its walls had not been sufficiently water-tight in the rainy\nseason, at this time, at least, they were some protection against the\nseverity of the cold. There was, besides, a sort of fireplace with a\nflue of bricks very poorly laid, which enabled them to kindle a fire,\nand thus withstand the external temperature.\n\n\"Here is a shelter, at least,\" said Glenarvan, \"even if it is not\ncomfortable.

If Captain Grant was a\nprisoner of one of these tribes, had he been carried to the north or\nto the south? This problem harassed Glenarvan. It was advisable at all\nhazards to keep track of the captain. In short, it was better to follow\nThalcave's advice and reach the village of Tandil, where at least they\ncould obtain information.\n\nAbout four o'clock in the afternoon they approached a hill that might\nhave passed for a mountain in so level a country. It was Tapalquem\nSierra, and at its foot the travelers encamped for the night.\n\n[Sidenote: GALLOPING GAUCHOS.]\n\nThe passage of this mountain was accomplished the next day with the\ngreatest ease. They followed the sandy undulations of a gradually\nsloping terrace, which certainly did not present difficulties to\npeople who had scaled the Andes, and the horses scarcely relaxed their\nrapid pace. At noon they reached the abandoned Fort Tapalquem, the\nfirst of the chain of forts built on the southern frontier against the\nplundering natives. But not a shadow of an Indian did they encounter,\nto the increasing surprise of Thalcave; although, towards the middle of\nthe day, three rovers of the plain, well armed and mounted, gazed for\na moment at the little party, but prevented their approach, galloping\naway with incredible rapidity. Glenarvan was furious.\n\n\"Gauchos,\" said the Patagonian.\n\n\"Ah! Gauchos,\" replied MacNabb. \"Well, Paganel, what do you think of\nthese creatures?\"\n\n\"I think they look like famous bandits,\" answered Paganel.\n\n\"And hence of course are, my dear geographer?\"\n\n\"Of course, my dear major.\"\n\nPaganel's avowal was followed by a general laugh, which did not\ndisconcert him at all.\n\nAccording to Thalcave's orders, they advanced in close ranks, and\nat evening encamped in a spacious abandoned rancho, where the chief\nCatriel generally assembled his bands of natives. From an examination\nof the ground and the absence of fresh tracks, the Patagonian knew that\nit had not been occupied for a long time.\n\nThe next morning Glenarvan and his companions found themselves again\non the plain. The first estancias (vast establishments for raising\ncattle), which border upon the Tandil, were descried; but Thalcave\nresolved not to stop, but to keep straight on to Fort Independence,\nwhere he wished to obtain information, especially concerning the\nsingular condition of this abandoned country.\n\nThe trees, so rare since leaving the Andes, now reappeared. The greater\npart of these have been planted since the arrival of the Europeans\non the American continent. They generally surround \"corrals,\" vast\ncattle-inclosures protected with stakes. Here thousands of cattle,\nsheep, cows, and horses, branded with the mark of the owner, graze\nand fatten, while large numbers of huge dogs keep watch. The soil is\nadmirably adapted to raising cattle, and yields an excellent fodder.\n\nThe people lead the life of the shepherds of the Bible. Their flocks\nare perhaps even more numerous than those which fed on the plains of\nMesopotamia; but the family element is wanting, and the owners of the\ngreat folds of the Pampas have little to recommend themselves or their\nmanner of life.\n\nPaganel explained all these particulars to his companions, and even\nsucceeded in interesting the major.\n\nThalcave, meanwhile, hastened their progress, as he wished to arrive\nthat evening at Fort Independence. The horses, urged on by their\nmasters, and following the example of Thaouka, dashed through the\ntall grass. They passed several farms, fortified and defended by deep\nditches. The principal house was provided with an elevated terrace,\nfrom which the inmates could fire upon the plunderers of the plain.\nGlenarvan might perhaps have obtained here the information that he\nsought; but it was wisest to go to the village of Tandil. They did not\nstop, therefore, and soon the feet of the horses struck the grassy\nsward of the first mountain slopes. An hour afterward the village\nappeared at t"}]}

A moment after,\nthree shakes of the rope informed them that he had accomplished his\ndescent successfully.\n\nGlenarvan and Lady Helena now ventured out of the grotto. The\ndarkness below was still profound, but the gray light of dawn was\nalready tinging the top of the mountain. The keen cold of the morning\nreanimated the young wife; she felt stronger, and commenced her\nperilous escape.\n\n[Sidenote: A PRECIPITATE DESCENT.]\n\nFirst her husband, and then she, slid down the rope to the point where\nthe perpendicular wall met the summit of the slope. Then Glenarvan,\ngoing before his wife and assisting her, began to descend the\ndeclivity of the mountain backwards. He sought for tufts of grass and\nbushes that offered a point of support, and tried them before placing\nLady Helena's feet upon them. Several birds, suddenly awakened, flew\naway with shrill cries, and the fugitives shuddered when a large stone\nrolled noisily to the base of the mountain.\n\nThey had accomplished half the distance when a voice was heard at the\nopening of the grotto.\n\n\"Stop!\" whispered Captain Mangles.\n\nGlenarvan, clinging with one hand to a tuft of grass and holding his\nwife with the other, waited, scarcely breathing.\n\nWilson had taken alarm. Hearing some noise outside, he had returned to\nthe hut, and, raising the mat, watched the Maoris. At a sign from him\nthe captain had stopped Glenarvan.\n\nIn truth, one of the warriors, startled by some unaccustomed sound,\nhad risen and approached the prison. Standing two paces from the\nhut, he listened with lowered head. He remained in this attitude\nfor a moment, that seemed an hour, with ear intent and eye on the\nalert. Then, shaking his head as a man who is mistaken, he returned\nto his companions, took an armful of dead wood and threw it on the\nhalf-extinct fire, whose flames revived. His face, brightly illumined\nby the blaze, betrayed no more anxiety, and, after gazing at the first\nglimmers of dawn that tinged the horizon, he stretched himself beside\nthe fire to warm his cold limbs.\n\n\"All right!\" said Wilson.\n\nThe captain made a sign to Glenarvan to continue his descent. The\nlatter, accordingly, slid gently down the slope, and soon Lady Helena\nand he stood on the narrow path where Robert was waiting for them. The\nrope was shaken three times, and next Captain Mangles, followed by Mary\nGrant, took the same perilous course. They were successful, and joined\nLord and Lady Glenarvan.\n\nFive minutes later all the fugitives, after their fortunate escape\nfrom the hut, left this temporary retreat, and, avoiding the inhabited\nshores of the lake, made their way by narrow paths farther down the\nmountain. They advanced rapidly, seeking to avoid all points where they\nmight be seen. They did not speak, but glided like shadows through the\nbushes. Where were they going? At random, it is true, but they were\nfree.\n\nAbout five o'clock day began to break. Purple tints colored the lofty\nbanks of clouds. The mountain peaks emerged from the mists of the\nmorning. The orb of day would not be long in appearing, and instead of\nbeing the signal for torture, was to betray the flight of the condemned.\n\nBefore this dreaded moment arrived it was important that the fugitives\nshould be beyond the reach of the savages. But they could not advance\nquickly, for the paths were steep. Lady Helena scaled the declivities,\nsupported and even carried by Glenarvan, while Mary Grant leaned upon\nthe arm of her betrothed. Robert, happy and triumphant, whose heart was\nfull of joy at his success, took the lead, followed by the two sailors.\n\nFor half an hour the fugitives wandered at a venture.

There were thirty-five miles more to travel before they were\nout of Chili.\n\nThe country had not changed. It was still rich in amaryllis, violets,\ndate-trees, and golden-flowered cactuses. A few animals, among\nothers the ocelot, inhabited the thickets. A heron, a solitary owl,\nthrushes and snipes wary of the talons of the hawk, were the only\nrepresentatives of the feathered tribe.\n\nOf the natives few were seen; only some \"guassos\" (degenerate children\nof the Indians and Spanish), galloping on horses which they lacerated\nwith the gigantic spurs that adorned their naked feet, and passing\nlike shadows. They met on the way no one who could inform them, and\ninquiries were therefore utterly impossible.\n\n[Sidenote: AN ASTONISHED CATAPAZ.]\n\nGlenarvan thought that Captain Grant, if prisoner of the Indians, must\nhave been carried by them beyond the Andes. Their search could be\nsuccessful only in the Pampas. They must be patient, and travel on\nswiftly and continuously.\n\n[Illustration: By means of a ford, they crossed the Rio Tubal, the\nmountains visible in the distance.]\n\nThey advanced in the same order as before, which Robert with difficulty\nkept, for his eagerness led him to press forward, to the great\nannoyance of his animal. Nothing but a command from Glenarvan would\nkeep the young boy at his place in the line. The country now became\nmore uneven; and several hillocks indicated that they were approaching\nthe mountains.\n\nPaganel still continued his study of Spanish.\n\n\"What a language it is!\" exclaimed he; \"so full and sonorous!\"\n\n\"But you are making progress, of course?\" replied Glenarvan.\n\n\"Certainly, my dear lord. Ah! if there were only no accent! But, alas!\nthere is one!\"\n\nIn studying this language, Paganel did not, however, neglect his\ngeographical observations. In these, indeed, he was astonishingly\nclever, and could not have found his superior. When Glenarvan\nquestioned the catapaz about some peculiarity of the country, his\nlearned companion would always anticipate the answer of the guide, who\nthen gazed at him with a look of amazement.\n\nThat same day they met a road which crossed the line that they had\nhitherto pursued. Lord Glenarvan naturally asked its name of their\nguide, and Paganel as naturally answered,--\n\n\"The road from Yumbel to Los Angelos.\"\n\nGlenarvan looked at the catapaz.\n\n\"Exactly,\" replied he.\n\nThen, addressing the geographer, he said,--\n\n\"You have traveled in this country?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" replied Paganel gravely.\n\n\"On a mule?\"\n\n\"No; in an arm-chair.\"\n\nThe catapaz did not understand, for he shrugged his shoulders and\nreturned to the head of the troop.\n\nAt five o'clock in the afternoon they stopped in a shallow gorge, a\nfew miles above the little town of Loja; and that night the travelers\nencamped at the foot of the first slopes of the Andes.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\nELEVEN THOUSAND FEET ALOFT.\n\n\nThe route through Chili had as yet presented no serious obstacles; but\nnow the dangers that attend a journey across the mountains suddenly\nincreased, the struggle with the natural difficulties was about to\nbegin in earnest.\n\nAn important question had to be decided before starting. By what pass\ncould they cross the Andes with the least departure from the prescribed\ncourse? The catapaz was questioned on this subject.\n\n\"I know,\" he replied, \"of but two passes that are practicable in this\npart of the Andes.\"\n\n\"Doubtless the pass of Arica,\" said Paganel, \"which was discovered by\nValdivia Mendoza.\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\n\"And that of Villarica, situated to the south of Nevado.\"\n\n\"You are right.\"\n\n\"Well, my friend, these two passes have only one difficulty; they will\ncarry us to the south, or the north, farther than we wish.\"\n\n\"Have you another pass to propose?"}, {"chunk_id": 233, "text": "ctly,\" replied Harry Grant; \"and scarcely a day has passed but\nmemory has recalled those words upon which our only hope hung.\"\n\n\"And what are they, captain?\" inquired Glenarvan. \"Tell us, for our\ncuriosity is great.\"\n\n\"I am ready to satisfy you,\" continued Harry Grant; \"but you know that,\nto increase the chances of success, I inclosed in the bottle three\ndocuments, written in three languages. Which one do you wish to hear?\"\n\n\"They are not identical, then?\" cried Paganel.\n\n\"Yes, almost to a word.\"\n\n\"Well, give us the French document,\" said Glenarvan. \"This one was\nspared the most by the waves, and has served as the principal basis for\nour search.\"\n\n\"This is it, my lord, word for word,\" answered Harry Grant.\n\n\"'On the 27th June, 1862, the brig Britannia, of Glasgow, was lost\n1500 leagues from Patagonia, in the southern hemisphere. Carried by the\nwaves, two sailors and Captain Grant reached Tabor Island----'\"\n\n\"Ha!\" interrupted Paganel.\n\n\"'Here,'\" resumed Harry Grant, \"'continually a prey to a cruel\ndestitution, they cast this document into the sea at longitude 153° and\nlatitude 37° 11'. Come to their aid, or they are lost.'\"\n\nAt the word \"Tabor,\" Paganel had suddenly risen, and then, controlling\nhimself no longer, he cried:\n\n\"How Tabor Island? It is Maria Theresa.\"\n\n\"Certainly, Mr. Paganel,\" replied Harry Grant; \"Maria Theresa on the\nEnglish and German, but Tabor on the French maps.\"\n\nAt this moment a vigorous blow descended upon Paganel's shoulder. Truth\ncompels us to say that it was from the major, who now failed in his\nstrict habits of propriety.\n\n\"A fine geographer you are!\" said MacNabb, in a tone of badinage. \"But\nno matter, since we have succeeded.\"\n\n\"No matter?\" cried Paganel; \"I ought never to have forgotten that\ntwofold appellation! It is an unpardonable mistake, unworthy of the\nsecretary of a Geographical Society. I am disgraced!\"\n\nWhen the meal was finished, Harry Grant put everything in order in his\nhouse. He took nothing away, for he was willing that the guilty convict\nshould inherit his possessions.\n\nThey returned to the vessel; and, as he expected to sail the same day,\nGlenarvan gave orders for the quartermaster's landing. Ayrton was\nbrought on deck, and found himself in the presence of Harry Grant.\n\n\"It is I, Ayrton,\" said he.\n\n\"Yes, captain,\" replied Ayrton, without betraying any astonishment at\nHarry Grant's appearance. \"Well, I am not sorry to see you again in\ngood health.\"\n\n[Illustration: The passengers could see the quartermaster, with folded\narms, standing motionless as a statue, on a rock, and gazing at the\nvessel.]\n\n\"It seems, Ayrton, that I made a mistake in landing you on an inhabited\ncoast.\"\n\n\"It seems so, captain.\"\n\n\"You will take my place on this desert island. May Heaven lead you to\nrepentance!\"\n\n\"May it be so,\" rejoined Ayrton, in a calm tone.\n\nThen Glenarvan, addressing the quartermaster, said:\n\n\"Do you still adhere, Ayrton, to this determination to be abandoned?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord.\"\n\n\"Does Tabor Island suit you?\"\n\n\"Perfectly.\"\n\n\"Now listen to my last words. You will be far removed from every land,\nand deprived of all communication with your fellow-men. Miracles are\nrare, and you will not probably remove from this island, where we leave\nyou. You will be alone, under the eye of God, who reads the uttermost\ndepths of all hearts; but you will not be lost, as was Captain Grant.\nHowever unworthy you may be of the remembrance of men, still they will\nremember you. I know where you are, and will never forget you.\"\n\n\"Thank you, my lord!\" replied Ayrton, simply.\n\nSuch were the last words exchanged between Glenarvan and the\nquartermaster. The boat was ready, and Ayrton embarked. Captain Mangles\nhad previously sent to the island several cases of preserved food, some\nclothes, tools, weapons, and a supply of powder and shot. The abandoned\nman could therefore employ his time to advantage. Nothing was wanting,\nnot even books, foremost among which was a Bible.\n\nThe hour for separation had come.

He came out of his examination very creditably; the\nreverence with which he spoke of the Creator and of the Bible produced\na very favorable impression on the Scottish heads of the expedition,\nwhilst the fact that he had taken \"the first prize in geography\" was\nsufficient introduction to Monsieur Paganel, who forthwith tested his\nknowledge, greatly to his own satisfaction, and considerably to the\ncredit of his young pupil. The curiosity of his discoverers having been\nfully satisfied, Toliné was made welcome, and partook with the others\nof the general repast. Many were the plans and purposes concerning\nhim, and much wonder was expressed as to how they could speed him on\nhis way; but in the morning it was discovered that he had solved the\nproblem for himself, and a bouquet of fresh leaves and flowers, laid by\nthe side of Lady Helena's seat, was the only memento that Toliné had\nleft.\n\n[Sidenote: A GOLDEN CITY.]\n\nThe party were now approaching the district which, in the years 1851\nand 1852, was so much talked of throughout the civilized world,\nand attracted from all parts so many reckless adventurers and\nfortune-hunters. The line of the thirty-seventh parallel, on which they\nwere traveling, led them through the diggings and municipality of Mount\nAlexander, which was one of the most successful spots for the digger at\nthe commencement of the gold fever, in consequence of the comparatively\nlevel nature of the ground and the general richness of the soil, so\ndifferent from some other localities where only once in a while was\nsome enormous nugget to be found. As they drew near to the streets of\nthis hastily-built town, Ayrton and Mulready, who were in charge of the\ncart, were sent forward, whilst the others walked through the place to\ninspect what there might be of interest, as well as to ascertain what\nmight be learned concerning the object of their expedition.\n\nThus, in this strange gathering of all nationalities and creeds and\nprofessions, the regular inhabitants beheld a still more extraordinary\nsight than that every day afforded them: folks who to the refinement\nwhich education and civilization give added both the earnestness\nof the worker and the freshness and vigor of the pleasure-seeking\ntourist. In the streets, in connection with the strange sign-boards and\nannouncements, the novel erections and purposes to which some of them\nwere adapted, Paganel had a history and commentary for every one.\n\nStill more did he expatiate upon the thousand-and-one topics of\ninterest when they visited the bank building, which here is the\ncentre of more than one agency connected with this great gold-bearing\ndistrict. Here was the mineralogical museum, in which might be seen\nspecimens illustrative of all the various ways in which the gold has\nbeen found, whether in combination with clay or other minerals, or--as\nit is sometimes, to the great joy of the finder, discovered--_pur\net simple_. Here also were models, diagrams, and even the tools\nthemselves, to illustrate the different methods by which the object\nof search was dug out, or washed, or crushed, or tested. Here also\nwas an almost unequaled collection of precious stones, gems of all\nsorts, making the gallery in which they were placed a real Golconda\nfor its wealth and attractions. Besides all this, here was the centre\nof the varied agencies by which the reports were brought in from the\ncompanies established for mining purposes, and also from each isolated\nworker, of the space purchased, the number of feet or yards dug, the\nore extracted, the comparative richness or poverty of the soil here,\nthere, and elsewhere, which in their summarized and aggregate form have\ngreatly helped to a correct knowledge of the comparative and absolute\ngold-"}, {"chunk_id": 62, "text": "arvan, Robert, and Thalcave had yielded to the common law, and,\nstretched on their thick beds of grass, they enjoyed a refreshing\nsleep. The horses, overcome with fatigue, had lain down on the ground:\nThaouka alone, like a true blooded horse, slept standing, spirited in\nrepose as in action, and ready to start at the least sign from his\nmaster. Perfect tranquillity reigned within the inclosure, and the\nembers of the night-fire, as they gradually died out, cast their last\nrays over the silent obscurity.\n\nAbout ten o'clock, after a short sleep, the Indian awoke. His eyes\nbecame fixed beneath his lowered eyebrows, and his head was turned in a\nlistening attitude towards the plain. He seemed endeavoring to detect\nsome scarcely perceptible sound. A vague uneasiness was soon expressed\non his face, usually so calm. Had he perceived the approach of prowling\nIndians, or the coming of jaguars, water-tigers, and other formidable\nbeasts which are numerous in the neighborhood of rivers? This last\npossibility doubtless appeared plausible to him, for he cast a rapid\nglance over the combustible materials piled in the inclosure, and his\nanxiety increased. In fact, all this dry bedding would quickly be\nconsumed, and could not long intimidate the audacious animals.\n\nAccording to this conjecture, Thalcave had only to await the progress\nof events, which he did, half reclining, his head resting on his hands,\nhis elbows on his knees, his eyes motionless, in the attitude of a man\nwhom a sudden anxiety has awakened from sleep.\n\nAn hour passed. Any other person but Thalcave, reassured by the outward\nsilence, would have lain down again. But where a stranger would have\nsuspected nothing, the highly-trained senses and natural instinct of\nthe Indian foresaw the coming danger.\n\nWhile he was listening and watching, Thaouka gave a low neigh. His\nnose was stretched towards the entrance to the ramada. The Patagonian\nsuddenly started.\n\n\"Thaouka has scented some enemy,\" said he.\n\nHe arose and scanned the plain attentively. Silence still reigned, but\nnot tranquillity. Thalcave discerned shadows moving noiselessly among\nthe tufts of grass. Here and there glittered luminous points, which\nspread on all sides, now fading away, and now gleaming forth again. You\nwould have thought fantastic elves were dancing on the surface of an\nimmense lagoon. A stranger would doubtless have taken these flitting\nsparks for glow-worms, which shine, when night comes, in many parts of\nthe Pampas. But Thalcave was not deceived; he knew with what enemies he\nhad to deal. He loaded his carbine, and took a position near the first\nstakes of the inclosure.\n\nHe did not wait long. A strange cry, a mingling of barks and howls,\nresounded over the plain. The report of the carbine answered it,\nand was followed by a hundred frightful yelps. Glenarvan and Robert\nsuddenly awoke.\n\n[Sidenote: FEARFUL ODDS.]\n\n\"What is the matter?\" asked Robert.\n\n\"Indians?\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\"No,\" replied Thalcave, \"aguaras.\"\n\nRobert looked at Glenarvan.\n\n\"Aguaras?\" said he.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Glenarvan, \"the red wolves of the Pampas.\"\n\nBoth seized their weapons, and joined the Indian. The latter pointed\nto the plain, from which arose a series of formidable howls. Robert\ninvoluntarily took a step backward.\n\n\"You are not afraid of the wolves, my boy?\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\"No, my lord,\" replied Robert, in a firm tone. \"With you I fear\nnothing.\"\n\n\"So much the better.

We anchored our\nvessel—which had a double hold, where our goods were concealed—amidst a\nnumber of other vessels that bordered the banks of the Rhône from\nBeaucaire to Arles. On our arrival we began to discharge our cargo in\nthe night, and to convey it into the town, by the help of the innkeeper\nwith whom we were connected.\n\n“Whether success rendered us imprudent, or whether we were betrayed, I\nknow not; but one evening, about five o’clock, our little cabin-boy\ncame breathlessly, to inform us that he had seen a detachment of\ncustom-house officers advancing in our direction. It was not their\nproximity that alarmed us, for detachments were constantly patrolling\nalong the banks of the Rhône, but the care, according to the boy’s\naccount, that they took to avoid being seen. In an instant we were on\nthe alert, but it was too late; our vessel was surrounded, and amongst\nthe custom-house officers I observed several gendarmes, and, as\nterrified at the sight of their uniforms as I was brave at the sight of\nany other, I sprang into the hold, opened a port, and dropped into the\nriver, dived, and only rose at intervals to breathe, until I reached a\nditch that had recently been made from the Rhône to the canal that runs\nfrom Beaucaire to Aigues-Mortes. I was now safe, for I could swim along\nthe ditch without being seen, and I reached the canal in safety. I had\ndesignedly taken this direction. I have already told your excellency of\nan innkeeper from Nîmes who had set up a little tavern on the road from\nBellegarde to Beaucaire.”\n\n“Yes,” said Monte Cristo “I perfectly recollect him; I think he was\nyour colleague.”\n\n“Precisely,” answered Bertuccio; “but he had, seven or eight years\nbefore this period, sold his establishment to a tailor at Marseilles,\nwho, having almost ruined himself in his old trade, wished to make his\nfortune in another. Of course, we made the same arrangements with the\nnew landlord that we had with the old; and it was of this man that I\nintended to ask shelter.”\n\n“What was his name?” inquired the count, who seemed to become somewhat\ninterested in Bertuccio’s story.\n\n“Gaspard Caderousse; he had married a woman from the village of\nCarconte, and whom we did not know by any other name than that of her\nvillage. She was suffering from malarial fever, and seemed dying by\ninches. As for her husband, he was a strapping fellow of forty, or\nfive-and-forty, who had more than once, in time of danger, given ample\nproof of his presence of mind and courage.”\n\n“And you say,” interrupted Monte Cristo “that this took place towards\nthe year——”\n\n“1829, your excellency.”\n\n“In what month?”\n\n“June.”\n\n“The beginning or the end?”\n\n“The evening of the 3rd.”\n\n20303m\n\n\n\n“Ah,” said Monte Cristo “the evening of the 3rd of June, 1829.

Aided by the remaining fragment, I guessed the rest; measuring\nthe length of the lines by those of the paper, and divining the hidden\nmeaning by means of what was in part revealed, as we are guided in a\ncavern by the small ray of light above us.”\n\n“And what did you do when you arrived at this conclusion?”\n\n“I resolved to set out, and did set out at that very instant, carrying\nwith me the beginning of my great work, the unity of the Italian\nkingdom; but for some time the imperial police (who at this period,\nquite contrary to what Napoleon desired so soon as he had a son born to\nhim, wished for a partition of provinces) had their eyes on me; and my\nhasty departure, the cause of which they were unable to guess, having\naroused their suspicions, I was arrested at the very moment I was\nleaving Piombino.\n\n“Now,” continued Faria, addressing Dantès with an almost paternal\nexpression, “now, my dear fellow, you know as much as I do myself. If\nwe ever escape together, half this treasure is yours; if I die here,\nand you escape alone, the whole belongs to you.”\n\n“But,” inquired Dantès hesitating, “has this treasure no more\nlegitimate possessor in the world than ourselves?”\n\n“No, no, be easy on that score; the family is extinct. The last Count\nof Spada, moreover, made me his heir, bequeathing to me this symbolic\nbreviary, he bequeathed to me all it contained; no, no, make your mind\nsatisfied on that point. If we lay hands on this fortune, we may enjoy\nit without remorse.”\n\n“And you say this treasure amounts to——”\n\n“Two millions of Roman crowns; nearly thirteen millions of our money.”2\n\n“Impossible!” said Dantès, staggered at the enormous amount.\n\n“Impossible? and why?” asked the old man. “The Spada family was one of\nthe oldest and most powerful families of the fifteenth century; and in\nthose times, when other opportunities for investment were wanting, such\naccumulations of gold and jewels were by no means rare; there are at\nthis day Roman families perishing of hunger, though possessed of nearly\na million in diamonds and jewels, handed down by entail, and which they\ncannot touch.”\n\nEdmond thought he was in a dream—he wavered between incredulity and\njoy.\n\n“I have only kept this secret so long from you,” continu"}, {"chunk_id": 315, "text": "rprise and terror; and without a word I suffered myself to be\nhandcuffed and tied to a horse’s tail, and thus they took me to Nîmes.\n\n“I had been tracked by a customs-officer, who had lost sight of me near\nthe tavern; feeling certain that I intended to pass the night there, he\nhad returned to summon his comrades, who just arrived in time to hear\nthe report of the pistol, and to take me in the midst of such\ncircumstantial proofs of my guilt as rendered all hopes of proving my\ninnocence utterly futile. One only chance was left me, that of\nbeseeching the magistrate before whom I was taken to cause every\ninquiry to be made for the Abbé Busoni, who had stopped at the inn of\nthe Pont du Gard on that morning.\n\n“If Caderousse had invented the story relative to the diamond, and\nthere existed no such person as the Abbé Busoni, then, indeed, I was\nlost past redemption, or, at least, my life hung upon the feeble chance\nof Caderousse himself being apprehended and confessing the whole truth.\n\n“Two months passed away in hopeless expectation on my part, while I\nmust do the magistrate the justice to say that he used every means to\nobtain information of the person I declared could exculpate me if he\nwould.

I felt some\ndegree of nervousness as I entered upon the history of the diamond,\nbut, to my inexpressible astonishment, he confirmed it in every\nparticular, and to my equal surprise, he seemed to place entire belief\nin all I said.\n\n“And then it was that, won by his mild charity, seeing that he was\nacquainted with all the habits and customs of my own country, and\nconsidering also that pardon for the only crime of which I was really\nguilty might come with a double power from lips so benevolent and kind,\nI besought him to receive my confession, under the seal of which I\nrecounted the Auteuil affair in all its details, as well as every other\ntransaction of my life. That which I had done by the impulse of my best\nfeelings produced the same effect as though it had been the result of\ncalculation. My voluntary confession of the assassination at Auteuil\nproved to him that I had not committed that of which I stood accused.\nWhen he quitted me, he bade me be of good courage, and to rely upon his\ndoing all in his power to convince my judges of my innocence.\n\n“I had speedy proofs that the excellent abbé was engaged in my behalf,\nfor the rigors of my imprisonment were alleviated by many trifling\nthough acceptable indulgences, and I was told that my trial was to be\npostponed to the assizes following those now being held.\n\n“In the interim it pleased Providence to cause the apprehension of\nCaderousse, who was discovered in some distant country, and brought\nback to France, where he made a full confession, refusing to make the\nfact of his wife’s having suggested and arranged the murder any excuse\nfor his own guilt. The wretched man was sentenced to the galleys for\nlife, and I was immediately set at liberty.”\n\n“And then it was, I presume,” said Monte Cristo “that you came to me as\nthe bearer of a letter from the Abbé Busoni?”\n\n“It was, your excellency; the benevolent abbé took an evident interest\nin all that concerned me.\n\n“‘Your mode of life as a smuggler,’ said he to me one day, ‘will be the\nruin of you; if you get out, don’t take it up again.’\n\n“‘But how,’ inquired I, ‘am I to maint"}, {"chunk_id": 123, "text": "\nthe owner knowing who he was; and however the old sailor and his crew\ntried to “pump” him, they extracted nothing more from him; he gave\naccurate descriptions of Naples and Malta, which he knew as well as\nMarseilles, and held stoutly to his first story. Thus the Genoese,\nsubtle as he was, was duped by Edmond, in whose favor his mild\ndemeanor, his nautical skill, and his admirable dissimulation, pleaded.\nMoreover, it is possible that the Genoese was one of those shrewd\npersons who know nothing but what they should know, and believe nothing\nbut what they should believe.\n\nIn this state of mutual understanding, they reached Leghorn. Here\nEdmond was to undergo another trial; he was to find out whether he\ncould recognize himself, as he had not seen his own face for fourteen\nyears. He had preserved a tolerably good remembrance of what the youth\nhad been, and was now to find out what the man had become. His comrades\nbelieved that his vow was fulfilled. As he had twenty times touched at\nLeghorn, he remembered a barber in St. Ferdinand Street; he went there\nto have his beard and hair cut. The barber gazed in amazement at this\nman with the long, thick and black hair and beard, which gave his head\nthe appearance of one of Titian’s portraits. At this period it was not\nthe fashion to wear so large a beard and hair so long; now a barber\nwould only be surprised if a man gifted with such advantages should\nconsent voluntarily to deprive himself of them. The Leghorn barber said\nnothing and went to work.\n\nWhen the operation was concluded, and Edmond felt that his chin was\ncompletely smooth, and his hair reduced to its usual length, he asked\nfor a looking-glass. He was now, as we have said, three-and-thirty\nyears of age, and his fourteen years’ imprisonment had produced a great\ntransformation in his appearance.\n\nDantès had entered the Château d’If with the round, open, smiling face\nof a young and happy man, with whom the early paths of life have been\nsmooth, and who anticipates a future corresponding with his past. This\nwas now all changed. The oval face was lengthened, his smiling mouth\nhad assumed the firm and marked lines which betoken resolution; his\neyebrows were arched beneath a brow furrowed with thought; his eyes\nwere full of melancholy, and from their depths occasionally sparkled\ngloomy fires of misanthropy and hatred; his complexion, so long kept\nfrom the sun, had now that pale color which produces, when the features\nare encircled with black hair, the aristocratic beauty of the man of\nthe north; the profound learning he had acquired had besides diffused\nover his features a refined intellectual expression; and he had also\nacquired, being naturally of a goodly stature, that vigor which a frame\npossesses which has so long concentrated all its force within itself.\n\n0283m\n\n\n\nTo the elegance of a nervous and slight form had succeeded the solidity\nof a rounded and muscular figure. As to his voice, prayers, sobs, and\nimprecations had changed it so that at times it was of a singularly\npenetrating sweetness, and at others rough and almost hoarse.\n\nMoreover, from being so long in twilight or darkness, his eyes had\nacquired the faculty of distinguishing objects in the night, common to\nthe hyena and the wolf. Edmond smiled when he beheld himself; it was\nimpossible that his best friend—if, indeed, he had any friend\nleft—could recognize him; he could not recognize himself.\n\nThe master of _La Jeune Amélie_, who was very desirous of retaining\namongst his crew a man of Edmond’s value, had offered to advance him\nfunds out of his future profits, which Edmond had accepted. His next\ncare on leaving the barber’s who had achieved his first metamorphosis\nwas to enter a shop and buy a complete sailor’s suit—a garb, as we all\nknow, very simple, and consisting of white trousers, a striped shirt,\nand a cap.\n\nIt was in this costume, and bringing back to Jacopo the shirt and\ntrousers he had lent him, that Edmond reappeared before the captain of\nthe lugger, who had ma"}]}

Instantly afterwards four\ncarbineers, on horseback, appeared on the edge of the wood; three of\nthem appeared to be looking for the fugitive, while the fourth dragged\na brigand prisoner by the neck. The three carbineers looked about\ncarefully on every side, saw the young peasants, and galloping up,\nbegan to question them. They had seen no one.\n\n“‘That is very annoying,’ said the brigadier; for the man we are\nlooking for is the chief.’\n\n“‘Cucumetto?’ cried Luigi and Teresa at the same moment.\n\n“‘Yes,’ replied the brigadier; ‘and as his head is valued at a thousand\nRoman crowns, there would have been five hundred for you, if you had\nhelped us to catch him.’ The two young persons exchanged looks. The\nbrigadier had a moment’s hope. Five hundred Roman crowns are three\nthousand lire, and three thousand lire are a fortune for two poor\norphans who are going to be married.\n\n“‘Yes, it is very annoying,’ said Vampa; ‘but we have not seen him.’\n\n“Then the carbineers scoured the country in different directions, but\nin vain; then, after a time, they disappeared. Vampa then removed the\nstone, and Cucumetto came out. Through the crevices in the granite he\nhad seen the two young peasants talking with the carbineers, and\nguessed the subject of their parley. He had read in the countenances of\nLuigi and Teresa their steadfast resolution not to surrender him, and\nhe drew from his pocket a purse full of gold, which he offered to them.\nBut Vampa raised his head proudly; as to Teresa, her eyes sparkled when\nshe thought of all the fine gowns and gay jewellery she could buy with\nthis purse of gold.\n\n“Cucumetto was a cunning fiend, and had assumed the form of a brigand\ninstead of a serpent, and this look from Teresa showed to him that she\nwas a worthy daughter of Eve, and he returned to the forest, pausing\nseveral times on his way, under the pretext of saluting his protectors.\n\n“Several days elapsed, and they neither saw nor heard of Cucumetto. The\ntime of the Carnival was at hand. The Count of San-Felice announced a\ngrand masked ball, to which all that were distinguished in Rome were\ninvited. Teresa had a great desire to see this ball. Luigi asked\npermission of his protector, the steward, that she and he might be\npresent amongst the servants of the house. This was granted. The ball\nwas given by the Count for the particular pleasure of his daughter\nCarmela, whom he adored. Carmela was precisely the age and figure of\nTeresa, and Teresa was as handsome as Carmela. On the evening of the\nball Teresa was attired in her best, her most brilliant ornaments in\nher hair, and gayest glass beads,—she was in the costume of the women\nof Frascati.

The first thing\nnecessary to render an act valid is, that the notary should be\nthoroughly convinced that he has faithfully interpreted the will and\nwishes of the person dictating the act.

An imperceptible smile of triumph\nwas expressed on the lips of the procureur.

Will you tell me what you require, in\norder to set your conscience quite at ease on the subject?”\n\n“In order to render an act valid, I must be certain of the approbation\nor disapprobation of my client.

Noirtier closed his eyes.\n\n“And you approve of what she said—that is to say, you declare that the\nsigns which she mentioned are really those by means of which you are\naccustomed to convey your thoughts?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“It was you who sent for me?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“To make your will?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“And you do not wish me to go away without fulfilling your original\nintentions?” The old man winked violently.\n\n“Well, sir,” said the young girl, “do you understand now, and is your\nconscience perfectly at rest on the subject?”\n\nBut before the notary could answer, Villefort had drawn him aside.\n\n“Sir,” said he, “do you suppose for a moment that a man can sustain a\nphysical shock, such as M. Noirtier has received, without any detriment\nto his mental faculties?”\n\n“It is not exactly that, sir,” said the notary, “which makes me uneasy,\nbut the difficulty will be in wording his thoughts and intentions, so\nas to be able to get his answers.”\n\n“You must see that to be an utter impossibility,” said Villefort.\nValentine and the old man heard this conversation, and Noirtier fixed\nhis eye so earnestly on Valentine that she felt bound to answer to the\nlook.\n\n“Sir,” said she, “that need not make you uneasy, however difficult it\nmay at first sight appear to be.

But as Villefort saw\nhis father but seldom, and then only when absolutely obliged, and as he\nnever took any pains to please or gratify him when he was there, all\nthe old man’s happiness was centred in his granddaughter. Valentine, by\nmeans of her love, her patience, and her devotion, had learned to read\nin Noirtier’s look all the varied feelings which were passing in his\nmind. To this dumb language, which was so unintelligible to others, she\nanswered by throwing her whole soul into the expression of her\ncountenance, and in this manner were the conversations sustained\nbetween the blooming girl and the helpless invalid, whose body could\nscarcely be called a living one, but who, nevertheless, possessed a\nfund of knowledge and penetration, united with a will as powerful as\never although clogged by a body rendered utterly incapable of obeying\nits impulses.\n\nValentine had solved the problem, and was able easily to understand his\nthoughts, and to convey her own in return, and, through her untiring\nand devoted assiduity, it was seldom that, in the ordinary transactions\nof every-day life, she failed to anticipate the wishes of the living,\nthinking mind, or the wants of the almost inanimate body.\n\nAs to the servant, he had, as we have said, been with his master for\nfive-and-twenty years, therefore he knew all his habits, and it was\nseldom that Noirtier found it necessary to ask for anything, so prompt\nwas he in administering to all the necessities of the invalid.\n\nVillefort did not need the help of either Valentine or the domestic in\norder to carry on with his father the strange conversation which he was\nabout to begin. As we have said, he perfectly understood the old man’s\nvocabulary, and if he did not use it more often, it was only\nindifference and _ennui_ which prevented him from so doing. He\ntherefore allowed Valentine to go into the garden, sent away Barrois,\nand after having seated himself at his father’s right hand, while\nMadame de Villefort placed herself on the left, he addressed him thus:\n\n“I trust you will not be displeased, sir, that Valentine has not come\nwith us, or that I dismissed Barrois, for our conference will be one\nwhich could not with propriety be carried on in the presence of either.\nMadame de Villefort and I have a communication to make to you.”\n\nNoirtier’s face remained perfectly passive during this long preamble,\nwhile, on the contrary, Villefort’s eye was endeavoring to penetrate\ninto the inmost recesses of the old man’s heart.\n\n“This communication,” continued the procureur, in that cold and\ndecisive tone which seemed at once to preclude all discussion, “will,\nwe are sure, meet with your approbation.”\n\nThe eye of the invalid still retained that vacancy of expression which\nprevented his son from obtaining any knowledge of the feelings which\nwere passing in his mind; he listened, nothing more.\n\n“Sir,” resumed Villefort, “we are thinking of marrying Valentine.” Had\nthe old man’s face been moulded in wax it could not have shown less\nemotion at this news than was now to be traced there. “The marriage\nwill take place in less than three months,” said Villefort.\n\nNoirtier’s eye still retained its inanimate expression.\n\nMadame de Villefort now took her part in the conversation and added:\n\n“We thought this news would possess an interest for you, sir, who have\nalways entertained a great affection for Valentine; it therefore only\nnow remains for us to tell you the name of the young man for whom she\nis destined.

No, I repeat again, that nothing shall induce me to renew\nattempts evidently at variance with the Almighty’s pleasure.”\n\nDantès held down his head, that the other might not see how joy at the\nthought of having a companion outweighed the sympathy he felt for t"}, {"chunk_id": 106, "text": "nce of this treasure, which\n\n           ...lions of Roman crowns, and which he\n\n                             ...ck from the small\n\n                           ...ings have been made\n\n                           ...ngle in the second;\n\n                                   ...tire to him\n\n                                    ...ar † Spada.”\n\n\nFaria followed him with an excited look.\n\n“And now,” he said, when he saw that Dantès had read the last line,\n“put the two fragments together, and judge for yourself.” Dantès\nobeyed, and the conjointed pieces gave the following:\n\n0245m\n\n\n\n“This 25th day of April, 1498, be...ing invited to dine by his Holiness\nAlexander VI., and fearing that not...content with making me pay for my\nhat, he may desire to become my heir, and re...serves for me the fate\nof Cardinals Caprara and Bentivoglio, who were poisoned,...I declare to\nmy nephew, Guido Spada, my sole heir, that I have bu...ried in a place\nhe knows and has visited with me, that is, in...the caves of the small\nIsland of Monte Cristo, all I poss...essed of ingots, gold, money,\njewels, diamonds, gems; that I alone...know of the existence of this\ntreasure, which may amount to nearly two mil...lions of Roman crowns,\nand which he will find on raising the twentieth ro...ck from the small\ncreek to the east in a right line.

Aided by the remaining fragment, I guessed the rest; measuring\nthe length of the lines by those of the paper, and divining the hidden\nmeaning by means of what was in part revealed, as we are guided in a\ncavern by the small ray of light above us.”\n\n“And what did you do when you arrived at this conclusion?”\n\n“I resolved to set out, and did set out at that very instant, carrying\nwith me the beginning of my great work, the unity of the Italian\nkingdom; but for some time the imperial police (who at this period,\nquite contrary to what Napoleon desired so soon as he had a son born to\nhim, wished for a partition of provinces) had their eyes on me; and my\nhasty departure, the cause of which they were unable to guess, having\naroused their suspicions, I was arrested at the very moment I was\nleaving Piombino.\n\n“Now,” continued Faria, addressing Dantès with an almost paternal\nexpression, “now, my dear fellow, you know as much as I do myself. If\nwe ever escape together, half this treasure is yours; if I die here,\nand you escape alone, the whole belongs to you.”\n\n“But,” inquired Dantès hesitating, “has this treasure no more\nlegitimate possessor in the world than ourselves?”\n\n“No, no, be easy on that score; the family is extinct. The last Count\nof Spada, moreover, made me his heir, bequeathing to me this symbolic\nbreviary, he bequeathed to me all it contained; no, no, make your mind\nsatisfied on that point. If we lay hands on this fortune, we may enjoy\nit without remorse.”\n\n“And you say this treasure amounts to——”\n\n“Two millions of Roman crowns; nearly thirteen millions of our money.”2\n\n“Impossible!” said Dantès, staggered at the enormous amount.\n\n“Impossible? and why?” asked the old man. “The Spada family was one of\nthe oldest and most powerful families of the fifteenth century; and in\nthose times, when other opportunities for investment were wanting, such\naccumulations of gold and jewels were by no means rare; there are at\nthis day Roman families perishing of hunger, though possessed of nearly\na million in diamonds and jewels, handed down by entail, and which they\ncannot touch.”\n\nEdmond thought he was in a dream—he wavered between incredulity and\njoy.\n\n“I have only kept this secret so long from you,” continu"}, {"chunk_id": 750, "text": "eat drinkers of water; As the flood proved once\nfor all.”\n\n[2] $2,600,000 in 1894.\n\n[3] Knocked on the head.\n\n[4] Beheaded.\n\n[5] Scott, of course: “The son of an ill-fated sire, and the father of\na yet more unfortunate family, bore in his looks that cast of\ninauspicious melancholy by which the physiognomists of that time\npretended to distinguish those who were predestined to a violent and\nunhappy death.”—The Abbot, ch. xxii.\n\n[6] Guillotine.\n\n[7] Dr. Guillotin got the idea of his famous machine from witnessing an\nexecution in Italy.\n\n[8] Brucea ferruginea.\n\n[9] ‘Money and sanctity, Each in a moiety.’\n\n[10] Elisabeth de Rossan, Marquise de Ganges, was one of the famous\nwomen of the court of Louis XIV. where she was known as “La Belle\nProvençale.” She was the widow of the Marquis de Castellane when she\nmarried de Ganges, and having the misfortune to excite the enmity of\nher new brothers-in-law, was forced by them to take poison; and they\nfinished her off with pistol and dagger.—Ed.\n\n[11] Magistrate and orator of great eloquence—chancellor of France\nunder Louis XV.\n\n[12] Jacques-Louis David, a famous French painter (1748-1825).\n\n[13] Ali Pasha, “The Lion,” was born at Tepelini, an Albanian village\nat the foot of the Klissoura Mountains, in 1741.

That man made a deep impression on me; I shall never forget\nhis countenance!”\n\n20025m\n\n\n\nThe Englishman smiled imperceptibly.\n\n“And you say, sir,” he interposed, “that the two dungeons——”\n\n“Were separated by a distance of fifty feet; but it appears that this\nEdmond Dantès——”\n\n“This dangerous man’s name was——”\n\n“Edmond Dantès. It appears, sir, that this Edmond Dantès had procured\ntools, or made them, for they found a tunnel through which the\nprisoners held communication with one another.”\n\n“This tunnel was dug, no doubt, with an intention of escape?”\n\n“No doubt; but unfortunately for the prisoners, the Abbé Faria had an\nattack of catalepsy, and died.”\n\n“That must have cut short the projects of escape.”\n\n“For the dead man, yes,” replied M. de Boville, “but not for the\nsurvivor; on the contrary, this Dantès saw a means of accelerating his\nescape. He, no doubt, thought that prisoners who died in the Château\nd’If were interred in an ordinary burial-ground, and he conveyed the\ndead man into his own cell, took his place in the sack in which they\nhad sewed up the corpse, and awaited the moment of interment.”\n\n“It was a bold step, and one that showed some courage,” remarked the\nEnglishman.\n\n“As I have already told you, sir, he was a very dangerous man; and,\nfortunately, by his own act disembarrassed the government of the fears\nit had on his account.”\n\n“How was that?”\n\n“How? Do you not comprehend?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“The Château d’If has no cemetery, and they simply throw the dead into\nthe sea, after fastening a thirty-six-pound cannon-ball to their feet.”\n\n“Well?” observed the Englishman as if he were slow of comprehension.\n\n“Well, they fastened a thirty-six-pound ball to his feet, and threw him\ninto the sea.”\n\n“Really!” exclaimed the Englishman.\n\n“Yes, sir,” continued the inspector of prisons. “You may imagine the\namazement of the fugitive when he found himself flung headlong over the\nrocks! I should like to have seen his face at that moment.”\n\n“That would have been difficult.”\n\n“No matter,” replied De Boville, in supreme good-humor at the certainty\nof recovering his two hundred thousand francs,—“no matter, I can fancy\nit.” And he shouted with laughter.\n\n“So can I,” said the Englishman, and he laughed too; but he laughed as\nthe English do, “at the end of his teeth.”\n\n“And so,” continued the Englishman who first gained his composure, “he\nwas drowned?”\n\n“Unquestionably.”\n\n“So that the governor got rid of the dangerous and the crazy prisoner\nat the same time?”\n\n“Precisely.”\n\n20027m\n\n\n\n“But some official document was drawn up as to this affair, I suppose?”\ninquired the Englishman.\n\n“Yes, yes, the mortuary deposition.

The carriage\nstopped near the Meta Sudans; the door was opened, and the young men,\neagerly alighting, found themselves opposite a _cicerone_, who appeared\nto have sprung up from the ground, so unexpected was his appearance.\n\nThe usual guide from the hotel having followed them, they had paid two\nconductors, nor is it possible, at Rome, to avoid this abundant supply\nof guides; besides the ordinary _cicerone_, who seizes upon you\ndirectly you set foot in your hotel, and never quits you while you\nremain in the city, there is also a special _cicerone_ belonging to\neach monument—nay, almost to each part of a monument. It may,\ntherefore, be easily imagined there is no scarcity of guides at the\nColosseum, that wonder of all ages, which Martial thus eulogizes:\n\n“Let Memphis cease to boast the barbarous miracles of her pyramids, and\nthe wonders of Babylon be talked of no more among us; all must bow to\nthe superiority of the gigantic labor of the Cæsars, and the many\nvoices of Fame spread far and wide the surpassing merits of this\nincomparable monument.”\n\nAs for Albert and Franz, they essayed not to escape from their\n_ciceronian_ tyrants; and, indeed, it would have been so much the more\ndifficult to break their bondage, as the guides alone are permitted to\nvisit these monuments with torches in their hands. Thus, then, the\nyoung men made no attempt at resistance, but blindly and confidingly\nsurrendered themselves into the care and custody of their conductors.\n\nFranz had already made seven or eight similar excursions to the\nColosseum, while his less favored companion trod for the first time in\nhis life the classic ground forming the monument of Flavius Vespasian;\nand, to his credit be it spoken, his mind, even amid the glib loquacity\nof the guides, was duly and deeply touched with awe and enthusiastic\nadmiration of all he saw; and certainly no adequate notion of these\nstupendous ruins can be formed save by such as have visited them, and\nmore especially by moonlight, at which time the vast proportions of the\nbuilding appear twice as large when viewed by the mysterious beams of a\nsouthern moonlit sky, whose rays are sufficiently clear and vivid to\nlight the horizon with a glow equal to the soft twilight of a western\nclime.\n\nScarcely, therefore, had the reflective Franz walked a hundred steps\nbeneath the interior porticoes of the ruin, when, abandoning Albert to\nthe guides (who would by no means yield their prescriptive right of\ncarrying their victims through the routine regularly laid down, and as\nregularly followed by them, but dragged the unconscious visitor to the\nvarious objects with a pertinacity that admitted of no appeal,\nbeginning, as a matter of course, with the “Lions’ Den”, the “Hall of\nthe Gladiators” and finishing with “Cæsar’s Podium”), to escape a\njargon and mechanical survey of the wonders by which he was surrounded,\nFranz ascended a half-dilapidated staircase, and, leaving them to\nfollow their monotonous round, seated himself at the foot of a column,\nand immediately opposite a large aperture, which permitted him to enjoy\na full and undisturbed view of the gigantic dimensions of the majestic\nruin.\n\nFranz had remained for nearly a quarter of an hour perfectly hidden by\nthe shadow of the vast column at whose base he had found a\nresting-place, and from whence his eyes followed the motions of Albert\nand his guides, who, holding torches in their hands, had emerged from a\nvomitorium at the opposite extremity of the Colosseum, and then again\ndisappeared down the steps conducting to the seats reserved for the\nVestal virgins, resembling, as they glided along, some restless shades\nfollowing the flickering glare of so m"}]}

Memory\nmakes the one, philosophy the other.”\n\n“But cannot one learn philosophy?”\n\n“Philosophy cannot be taught; it is the application of the sciences to\ntruth; it is like the golden cloud in which the Messiah went up into\nheaven.”\n\n“Well, then,” said Dantès, “What shall you teach me first? I am in a\nhurry to begin. I want to learn.”\n\n“Everything,” said the abbé. And that very evening the prisoners\nsketched a plan of education, to be entered upon the following day.\nDantès possessed a prodigious memory, combined with an astonishing\nquickness and readiness of conception; the mathematical turn of his\nmind rendered him apt at all kinds of calculation, while his naturally\npoetical feelings threw a light and pleasing veil over the dry reality\nof arithmetical computation, or the rigid severity of geometry. He\nalready knew Italian, and had also picked up a little of the Romaic\ndialect during voyages to the East; and by the aid of these two\nlanguages he easily comprehended the construction of all the others, so\nthat at the end of six months he began to speak Spanish, English, and\nGerman.\n\nIn strict accordance with the promise made to the abbé, Dantès spoke no\nmore of escape. Perhaps the delight his studies afforded him left no\nroom for such thoughts; perhaps the recollection that he had pledged\nhis word (on which his sense of honor was keen) kept him from referring\nin any way to the possibilities of flight. Days, even months, passed by\nunheeded in one rapid and instructive course. At the end of a year\nDantès was a new man. Dantès observed, however, that Faria, in spite of\nthe relief his society afforded, daily grew sadder; one thought seemed\nincessantly to harass and distract his mind. Sometimes he would fall\ninto long reveries, sigh heavily and involuntarily, then suddenly rise,\nand, with folded arms, begin pacing the confined space of his dungeon.\nOne day he stopped all at once, and exclaimed:\n\n“Ah, if there were no sentinel!”\n\n“There shall not be one a minute longer than you please,” said Dantès,\nwho had followed the working of his thoughts as accurately as though\nhis brain were enclosed in crystal so clear as to display its minutest\noperations.\n\n“I have already told you,” answered the abbé, “that I loathe the idea\nof shedding blood.”\n\n“And yet the murder, if you choose to call it so, would be simply a\nmeasure of self-preservation.”\n\n“No matter! I could never agree to it.”\n\n“Still, you have thought of it?”\n\n“Incessantly, alas!” cried the abbé.\n\n“And you have discovered a means of regaining our freedom, have you\nnot?” asked Dantès eagerly.\n\n“I have; if it were only possible to place a deaf and blind sentinel in\nthe gallery beyond us.”\n\n“He shall be both blind and deaf,” replied the young man, with an air\nof determination that made his companion shudder.\n\n“No, no,” cried the abbé; “impossible!”\n\nDantès endeavored to renew the subject; the abbé shook his head in\ntoken of disapproval, and refused to make any further response. Three\nmonths passed away.\n\n“Are you strong?” the abbé asked one day of Dantès. The young man, in\nreply, took up the chisel, bent it into the form of a horseshoe, and\nthen as readily straightened it.\n\n“And will you engage not to do any harm to the sentry, except as a last\nresort?”\n\n“I promise on my honor.”\n\n“Then,” said the abbé, “we may hope to put our design into execution.”\n\n“And how long shall we be in accomplishing the necessary work?”\n\n“At least a year.”\n\n“And shall we begin at once?”\n\n“At once.”\n\n“We have lost a year to no purpose!” cried Dantès.\n\n“Do you consider the last twelve months to have been wasted?” asked the\nabbé.\n\n“Forgive me!” cried Edmond, blushing deeply.\n\n“Tut, tut!” answered the abbé, “man is but man after all, and you are\nabout the best specimen of the genus I have ever known. Come, let me\nsh"}, {"chunk_id": 86, "text": "en weary with\ntoil, you had your hopes to refresh and encourage you.”\n\n“I assure you,” replied the old man, “I did not turn to that source for\nrecreation or support.”\n\n“What did you do then?”\n\n“I wrote or studied.”\n\n“Were you then permitted the use of pens, ink, and paper?”\n\n“Oh, no,” answered the abbé; “I had none but what I made for myself.”\n\n“You made paper, pens and ink?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nDantès gazed with admiration, but he had some difficulty in believing.\nFaria saw this.\n\n“When you pay me a visit in my cell, my young friend,” said he, “I will\nshow you an entire work, the fruits of the thoughts and reflections of\nmy whole life; many of them meditated over in the shades of the\nColosseum at Rome, at the foot of St. Mark’s column at Venice, and on\nthe borders of the Arno at Florence, little imagining at the time that\nthey would be arranged in order within the walls of the Château d’If.\nThe work I speak of is called _A Treatise on the Possibility of a\nGeneral Monarchy in Italy_, and will make one large quarto volume.”\n\n“And on what have you written all this?”\n\n“On two of my shirts. I invented a preparation that makes linen as\nsmooth and as easy to write on as parchment.”\n\n“You are, then, a chemist?”\n\n“Somewhat; I know Lavoisier, and was the intimate friend of Cabanis.”\n\n“But for such a work you must have needed books—had you any?”\n\n“I had nearly five thousand volumes in my library at Rome; but after\nreading them over many times, I found out that with one hundred and\nfifty well-chosen books a man possesses, if not a complete summary of\nall human knowledge, at least all that a man need really know. I\ndevoted three years of my life to reading and studying these one\nhundred and fifty volumes, till I knew them nearly by heart; so that\nsince I have been in prison, a very slight effort of memory has enabled\nme to recall their contents as readily as though the pages were open\nbefore me. I could recite you the whole of Thucydides, Xenophon,\nPlutarch, Titus Livius, Tacitus, Strada, Jornandes, Dante, Montaigne,\nShakespeare, Spinoza, Machiavelli, and Bossuet. I name only the most\nimportant.”\n\n“You are, doubtless, acquainted with a variety of languages, so as to\nhave been able to read all these?”\n\n“Yes, I speak five of the modern tongues—that is to say, German,\nFrench, Italian, English, and Spanish; by the aid of ancient Greek I\nlearned modern Greek—I don’t speak it so well as I could wish, but I am\nstill trying to improve myself.”\n\n“Improve yourself!” repeated Dantès; “why, how can you manage to do\nso?”\n\n“Why, I made a vocabulary of the words I knew; turned, returned, and\narranged them, so as to enable me to express my thoughts through their\nmedium. I know nearly one thousand words, which is all that is\nabsolutely necessary, although I believe there are nearly one hundred\nthousand in the dictionaries. I cannot hope to be very fluent, but I\ncertainly should have no difficulty in explaining my wants and wishes;\nand that would be quite as much as I should ever require.”\n\nStronger grew the wonder of Dantès, who almost fancied he had to do\nwith one gifted with supernatural powers; still hoping to find some\nimperfection which might bring him down to a level with human beings,\nhe added, “Then if you were not furnished with pens, how did you manage\nto write the work you speak of?”\n\n“I made myself some excellent ones, which would be universally\npreferred to all others if once known. You are aware what huge whitings\nare served to us on _maigre_ days. Well, I selected the cartilages of\nthe heads of these fishes, and you can scarcely imagine the delight\nwith which I welcomed the arrival of each Wednesday, Friday, and\nSaturday, as affording me the means of increasing my stock of pens; for\nI will freely confess that my historical labors have been my greatest\nsolace and relief. While retracing the past, I forget the present; and\ntraversing at will the path of history I cease to remember that I am\nmyself a prisoner.”\n\n“But the ink,” said Dantès; “of what did y"}, {"chunk_id": 473, "text": "\ntalent are they celebrated?

The thing was discussed for a long time, but finally decided\nin his favor. I can assure you the vertebra made a great noise in the\nlearned world, and the gentleman, who was only a knight of the Legion\nof Honor, was made an officer.”\n\n“Come,” said Monte Cristo, “this cross seems to me to be wisely\nawarded. I suppose, had he found another additional vertebra, they\nwould have made him a commander.”\n\n“Very likely,” said Albert.\n\n“And who can that person be who has taken it into his head to wrap\nhimself up in a blue coat embroidered with green?”\n\n“Oh, that coat is not his own idea; it is the Republic’s, which deputed\nDavid12 to devise a uniform for the Academicians.”\n\n“Indeed?” said Monte Cristo; “so this gentleman is an Academician?”\n\n“Within the last week he has been made one of the learned assembly.”\n\n“And what is his especial talent?”\n\n“His talent? I believe he thrusts pins through the heads of rabbits, he\nmakes fowls eat madder, and punches the spinal marrow out of dogs with\nwhalebone.”\n\n“And he is made a member of the Academy of Sciences for this?”\n\n“No; of the French Academy.”\n\n“But what has the French Academy to do with all this?”\n\n“I was going to tell you.

He was\nvery successful upon that question. He stood badly with the Liberal\npapers, but his noble opposition to the wishes of the court is now\ngetting him into favor with the journalists. They talk of making him an\nambassador.”\n\n30303m\n\n\n\n“And what are his claims to the peerage?”\n\n“He has composed two or three comic operas, written four or five\narticles in the _Siècle_, and voted five or six years on the\nministerial side.”\n\n“Bravo, viscount,” said Monte Cristo, smiling; “you are a delightful\n_cicerone_. And now you will do me a favor, will you not?”\n\n“What is it?”\n\n“Do not introduce me to any of these gentlemen; and should they wish\nit, you will warn me.” Just then the count felt his arm pressed. He\nturned round; it was Danglars.\n\n“Ah! is it you, baron?” said he.\n\n“Why do you call me baron?” said Danglars; “you know that I care\nnothing for my title. I am not like you, viscount; you like your title,\ndo you not?”\n\n“Certainly,” replied Albert, “seeing that without my title I should be\nnothing; while you, sacrificing the baron, would still remain the\nmillionaire.”\n\n“Which seems to me the finest title under the royalty of July,” replied\nDanglars.\n\n“Unfortunately,” said Monte Cristo, “one’s title to a millionaire does\nnot last for life, like that of baron, peer of France, or academician;\nfor example, the millionaires Franck & Poulmann, of Frankfurt, who have\njust become bankrupts.”\n\n“Indeed?” said Danglars, becoming pale.\n\n“Yes; I received the news this evening by a courier. I had about a\nmillion in their hands, but, warned in time, I withdrew it a month\nago.”\n\n“Ah, _mon Dieu!_” exclaimed Danglars, “they have drawn on me for\n200,000 francs!”\n\n“Well, you can throw out the draft; their signature is worth five per\ncent.”\n\n“Yes, but it is too late,” said Danglars, “I have honored their bills.”\n\n“Then,” said Monte Cristo, “here are 200,000 francs gone after——”\n\n“Hush, do not mention these things,” said Da"}, {"chunk_id": 109, "text": "gradually, besides the moral instructions we have detailed, taught his\nyouthful companion the patient and sublime duty of a prisoner, who\nlearns to make something from nothing. They were thus perpetually\nemployed,—Faria, that he might not see himself grow old; Dantès, for\nfear of recalling the almost extinct past which now only floated in his\nmemory like a distant light wandering in the night. So life went on for\nthem as it does for those who are not victims of misfortune and whose\nactivities glide along mechanically and tranquilly beneath the eye of\nProvidence.\n\nBut beneath this superficial calm there were in the heart of the young\nman, and perhaps in that of the old man, many repressed desires, many\nstifled sighs, which found vent when Faria was left alone, and when\nEdmond returned to his cell.\n\nOne night Edmond awoke suddenly, believing that he heard someone\ncalling him. He opened his eyes upon utter darkness. His name, or\nrather a plaintive voice which essayed to pronounce his name, reached\nhim. He sat up in bed and a cold sweat broke out upon his brow.\nUndoubtedly the call came from Faria’s dungeon.\n\n“Alas,” murmured Edmond; “can it be?”\n\nHe moved his bed, drew up the stone, rushed into the passage, and\nreached the opposite extremity; the secret entrance was open. By the\nlight of the wretched and wavering lamp, of which we have spoken,\nDantès saw the old man, pale, but yet erect, clinging to the bedstead.\nHis features were writhing with those horrible symptoms which he\nalready knew, and which had so seriously alarmed him when he saw them\nfor the first time.\n\n“Alas, my dear friend,” said Faria in a resigned tone, “you understand,\ndo you not, and I need not attempt to explain to you?”\n\nEdmond uttered a cry of agony, and, quite out of his senses, rushed\ntowards the door, exclaiming, “Help, help!”\n\nFaria had just sufficient strength to restrain him.\n\n“Silence,” he said, “or you are lost. We must now only think of you, my\ndear friend, and so act as to render your captivity supportable or your\nflight possible. It would require years to do again what I have done\nhere, and the results would be instantly destroyed if our jailers knew\nwe had communicated with each other. Besides, be assured, my dear\nEdmond, the dungeon I am about to leave will not long remain empty;\nsome other unfortunate being will soon take my place, and to him you\nwill appear like an angel of salvation. Perhaps he will be young,\nstrong, and enduring, like yourself, and will aid you in your escape,\nwhile I have been but a hindrance. You will no longer have half a dead\nbody tied to you as a drag to all your movements. At length Providence\nhas done something for you; he restores to you more than he takes away,\nand it was time I should die.”\n\nEdmond could only clasp his hands and exclaim, “Oh, my friend, my\nfriend, speak not thus!” and then resuming all his presence of mind,\nwhich had for a moment staggered under this blow, and his strength,\nwhich had failed at the words of the old man, he said, “Oh, I have\nsaved you once, and I will save you a second time!” And raising the\nfoot of the bed, he drew out the phial, still a third filled with the\nred liquor.\n\n“See,” he exclaimed, “there remains still some of the magic draught.\nQuick, quick! tell me what I must do this time; are there any fresh\ninstructions? Speak, my friend; I listen.”\n\n“There is not a hope,” replied Faria, shaking his head, “but no matter;\nGod wills it that man whom he has created, and in whose heart he has so\nprofoundly rooted the love of life, should do all in his power to\npreserve that existence, which, however painful it may be, is yet\nalways so dear.”\n\n“Oh, yes, yes!” exclaimed Dantès; “and I tell you that I will save you\nyet.”\n\n“Well, then, try. The cold gains upon me. I feel the blood flowing\ntowards my brain.

The two favorite studies of my youth were botany and\nmineralogy, and subsequently, when I learned that the use of simples\nfrequently explained the whole history of a people, and the entire life\nof individuals in the East, as flowers betoken and symbolize a love\naffair, I have regretted that I was not a man, that I might have been a\nFlamel, a Fontana, or a Cabanis.”\n\n“And the more, madame,” said Monte Cristo, “as the Orientals do not\nconfine themselves, as did Mithridates, to make a cuirass of his\npoisons, but they also made them a dagger. Science becomes, in their\nhands, not only a defensive weapon, but still more frequently an\noffensive one; the one serves against all their physical sufferings,\nthe other against all their enemies. With opium, belladonna, brucea,\nsnake-wood, and the cherry-laurel, they put to sleep all who stand in\ntheir way.

There are as many elixirs of every\nkind as there are caprices and peculiarities in the physical and moral\nnature of humanity; and I will say further—the art of these chemists is\ncapable with the utmost precision to accommodate and proportion the\nremedy and the bane to yearnings for love or desires for vengeance.”\n\n“But, sir,” remarked the young woman, “these Eastern societies, in the\nmidst of which you have passed a portion of your existence, are as\nfantastic as the tales that come from their strange land. A man can\neasily be put out of the way there, then; it is, indeed, the Bagdad and\nBassora of the _Thousand and One Nights_. The sultans and viziers who\nrule over society there, and who constitute what in France we call the\ngovernment, are really Haroun-al-Raschids and Giaffars, who not only\npardon a poisoner, but even make him a prime minister, if his crime has\nbeen an ingenious one, and who, under such circumstances, have the\nwhole story written in letters of gold, to divert their hours of\nidleness and _ennui_.”\n\n“By no means, madame; the fanciful exists no longer in the East. There,\ndisguised under other names, and concealed under other costumes, are\npolice agents, magistrates, attorneys-general, and bailiffs. They hang,\nbehead, and impale their criminals in the most agreeable possible\nmanner; but some of these, like clever rogues, have contrived to escape\nhuman justice, and succeed in their fraudulent enterprises by cunning\nstratagems.

That man made a deep impression on me; I shall never forget\nhis countenance!”\n\n20025m\n\n\n\nThe Englishman smiled imperceptibly.\n\n“And you say, sir,” he interposed, “that the two dungeons——”\n\n“Were separated by a distance of fifty feet; but it appears that this\nEdmond Dantès——”\n\n“This dangerous man’s name was——”\n\n“Edmond Dantès. It appears, sir, that this Edmond Dantès had procured\ntools, or made them, for they found a tunnel through which the\nprisoners held communication with one another.”\n\n“This tunnel was dug, no doubt, with an intention of escape?”\n\n“No doubt; but unfortunately for the prisoners, the Abbé Faria had an\nattack of catalepsy, and died.”\n\n“That must have cut short the projects of escape.”\n\n“For the dead man, yes,” replied M. de Boville, “but not for the\nsurvivor; on the contrary, this Dantès saw a means of accelerating his\nescape. He, no doubt, thought that prisoners who died in the Château\nd’If were interred in an ordinary burial-ground, and he conveyed the\ndead man into his own cell, took his place in the sack in which they\nhad sewed up the corpse, and awaited the moment of interment.”\n\n“It was a bold step, and one that showed some courage,” remarked the\nEnglishman.\n\n“As I have already told you, sir, he was a very dangerous man; and,\nfortunately, by his own act disembarrassed the government of the fears\nit had on his account.”\n\n“How was that?”\n\n“How? Do you not comprehend?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“The Château d’If has no cemetery, and they simply throw the dead into\nthe sea, after fastening a thirty-six-pound cannon-ball to their feet.”\n\n“Well?” observed the Englishman as if he were slow of comprehension.\n\n“Well, they fastened a thirty-six-pound ball to his feet, and threw him\ninto the sea.”\n\n“Really!” exclaimed the Englishman.\n\n“Yes, sir,” continued the inspector of prisons. “You may imagine the\namazement of the fugitive when he found himself flung headlong over the\nrocks! I should like to have seen his face at that moment.”\n\n“That would have been difficult.”\n\n“No matter,” replied De Boville, in supreme good-humor at the certainty\nof recovering his two hundred thousand francs,—“no matter, I can fancy\nit.” And he shouted with laughter.\n\n“So can I,” said the Englishman, and he laughed too; but he laughed as\nthe English do, “at the end of his teeth.”\n\n“And so,” continued the Englishman who first gained his composure, “he\nwas drowned?”\n\n“Unquestionably.”\n\n“So that the governor got rid of the dangerous and the crazy prisoner\nat the same time?”\n\n“Precisely.”\n\n20027m\n\n\n\n“But some official document was drawn up as to this affair, I suppose?”\ninquired the Englishman.\n\n“Yes, yes, the mortuary deposition.

Thus a new, a\nstronger, and more inexorable barrier was interposed to cut off the\nrealization of their hopes.\n\n“You see,” said the young man, with an air of sorrowful resignation, to\nFaria, “that God deems it right to take from me any claim to merit for\nwhat you call my devotion to you. I have promised to remain forever\nwith you, and now I could not break my promise if I would. The treasure\nwill be no more mine than yours, and neither of us will quit this\nprison. But my real treasure is not that, my dear friend, which awaits\nme beneath the sombre rocks of Monte Cristo, it is your presence, our\nliving together five or six hours a day, in spite of our jailers; it is\nthe rays of intelligence you have elicited from my brain, the languages\nyou have implanted in my memory, and which have taken root there with\nall their philological ramifications. These different sciences that you\nhave made so easy to me by the depth of the knowledge you possess of\nthem, and the clearness of the principles to which you have reduced\nthem—this is my treasure, my beloved friend, and with this you have\nmade me rich and happy. Believe me, and take comfort, this is better\nfor me than tons of gold and cases of diamonds, even were they not as\nproblematical as the clouds we see in the morning floating over the\nsea, which we take for _terra firma_, and which evaporate and vanish as\nwe draw near to them. To have you as long as possible near me, to hear\nyour eloquent speech,—which embellishes my mind, strengthens my soul,\nand makes my whole frame capable of great and terrible things, if I\nshould ever be free,—so fills my whole existence, that the despair to\nwhich I was just on the point of yielding when I knew you, has no\nlonger any hold over me; and this—this is my fortune—not chimerical,\nbut actual. I owe you my real good, my present happiness; and all the\nsovereigns of the earth, even Cæsar Borgia himself, could not deprive\nme of this.”\n\nThus, if not actually happy, yet the days these two unfortunates passed\ntogether went quickly. Faria, who for so long a time had kept silence\nas to the treasure, now perpetually talked of it. As he had prophesied\nwould be the case, he remained paralyzed in the right arm and the left\nleg, and had given up all hope of ever enjoying it himself. But he was\ncontinually thinking over some means of escape for his young companion,\nand anticipating the pleasure he would enjoy. For fear the letter might\nbe some day lost or stolen, he compelled Dantès to learn it by heart;\nand Dantès knew it from the first to the last word. Then he destroyed\nthe second portion, assured that if the first were seized, no one would\nbe able to discover its real meaning. Whole hours sometimes passed\nwhile Faria was giving instructions to Dantès,—instructions which were\nto serve him when he was at liberty. Then, once free, from the day and\nhour and moment when he was so, he could have but one only thought,\nwhich was, to gain Monte Cristo by some means, and remain there alone\nunder some pretext which would arouse no suspicions; and once there, to\nendeavor to find the wonderful caverns, and search in the appointed\nspot,—the appointed spot, be it remembered, being the farthest angle in\nthe second opening.\n\nIn the meanwhile the hours passed, if not rapidly, at least tolerably.\nFaria, as we have said, without having recovered the use of his hand\nand foot, had regained all the clearness of his understanding, and had\ngradually, besides the moral instructions we have detailed, taught his\nyouthful companion the patient and sublime duty of a prisoner, who\nlearns to make something from nothing. They were thus perpetually\nemployed,—Faria, that he might not see himself grow old; Dantès, for\nfear of recalling the almost extinct past which now only floated in his\nmemory like a distant light wandering in the night.

She advanced some\nsteps towards the staircase, and listened. ‘They are approaching,’ said\nshe; ‘perhaps they bring us peace and liberty!’\n\n“‘What do you fear, Vasiliki?’ said Selim, in a voice at once so gentle\nand yet so proud. ‘If they do not bring us peace, we will give them\nwar; if they do not bring life, we will give them death.’ And he\nrenewed the flame of his lance with a gesture which made one think of\nDionysus of old Crete.16 But I, being only a little child, was\nterrified by this undaunted courage, which appeared to me both\nferocious and senseless, and I recoiled with horror from the idea of\nthe frightful death amidst fire and flames which probably awaited us.\n\n“My mother experienced the same sensations, for I felt her tremble.\n‘Mamma, mamma,’ said I, ‘are we really to be killed?’ And at the sound\nof my voice the slaves redoubled their cries and prayers and\nlamentations. ‘My child,’ said Vasiliki, ‘may God preserve you from\never wishing for that death which today you so much dread!’ Then,\nwhispering to Selim, she asked what were her master’s orders. ‘If he\nsend me his poniard, it will signify that the emperor’s intentions are\nnot favorable, and I am to set fire to the powder; if, on the contrary,\nhe send me his ring, it will be a sign that the emperor pardons him,\nand I am to extinguish the match and leave the magazine untouched.’—‘My\nfriend,’ said my mother, ‘when your master’s orders arrive, if it is\nthe poniard which he sends, instead of despatching us by that horrible\ndeath which we both so much dread, you will mercifully kill us with\nthis same poniard, will you not?’—‘Yes, Vasiliki,’ replied Selim\ntranquilly.\n\n“Suddenly we heard loud cries; and, listening, discerned that they were\ncries of joy. The name of the French officer who had been sent to\nConstantinople resounded on all sides amongst our Palikares; it was\nevident that he brought the answer of the emperor, and that it was\nfavorable.”\n\n“And do you not remember the Frenchman’s name?” said Morcerf, quite\nready to aid the memory of the narrator. Monte Cristo made a sign to\nhim to be silent.\n\n“I do not recollect it,” said Haydée.\n\n“The noise increased; steps were heard approaching nearer and nearer;\nthey were descending the steps leading to the cavern. Selim made ready\nhis lance. Soon a figure appeared in the gray twilight at the entrance\nof the cave, formed by the reflection of the few rays of daylight which\nhad found their way into this gloomy retreat. ‘Who are you?’ cried\nSelim. ‘But whoever you may be, I charge you not to advance another\nstep.’—‘Long live the emperor!’ said the figure. ‘He grants a full\npardon to the Vizier Ali, and not only gives him his life, but restores\nto him his fortune and his possessions.’ My mother uttered a cry of\njoy, and clasped me to her bosom. ‘Stop,’ said Selim, seeing that she\nwas about to go out; ‘you see I have not yet received the\nring,’—‘True,’ said my mother. And she fell on her knees, at the same\ntime holding me up towards heaven, as if she desired, while praying to\nGod in my behalf, to raise me actually to his presence.”\n\nAnd for the second time Haydée stopped, overcome by such violent\nemotion that the perspiration stood upon her pale brow, and her stifled\nvoice seemed hardly able to find utterance, so parched and dry were her\nthroat and lips.\n\n40076m\n\n\n\nMonte Cristo poured a little iced water into a glass, and presented it\nto her, saying with a mildness in which was also a shade of\ncommand,—“Courage.”\n\nHaydée dried her eyes, and continued:\n\n“By this time our eyes, habituated to the darkness, had recognized the\nmessenger of the pasha,—it was a friend.

We hear From Yanina\n\nIf Valentine could have seen the trembling step and agitated\ncountenance of Franz when he quitted the chamber of M. Noirtier, even\nshe would have been constrained to pity him. Villefort had only just\ngiven utterance to a few incoherent sentences, and then retired to his\nstudy, where he received about two hours afterwards the following\nletter:\n\n“After all the disclosures which were made this morning, M. Noirtier de\nVillefort must see the utter impossibility of any alliance being formed\nbetween his family and that of M. Franz d’Épinay. M. d’Épinay must say\nthat he is shocked and astonished that M. de Villefort, who appeared to\nbe aware of all the circumstances detailed this morning, should not\nhave anticipated him in this announcement.”\n\n\nNo one who had seen the magistrate at this moment, so thoroughly\nunnerved by the recent inauspicious combination of circumstances, would\nhave supposed for an instant that he had anticipated the annoyance;\nalthough it certainly never had occurred to him that his father would\ncarry candor, or rather rudeness, so far as to relate such a history.\nAnd in justice to Villefort, it must be understood that M. Noirtier,\nwho never cared for the opinion of his son on any subject, had always\nomitted to explain the affair to Villefort, so that he had all his life\nentertained the belief that General de Quesnel, or the Baron d’Épinay,\nas he was alternately styled, according as the speaker wished to\nidentify him by his own family name, or by the title which had been\nconferred on him, fell the victim of assassination, and not that he was\nkilled fairly in a duel. This harsh letter, coming as it did from a man\ngenerally so polite and respectful, struck a mortal blow at the pride\nof Villefort.\n\nHardly had he read the letter, when his wife entered. The sudden\ndeparture of Franz, after being summoned by M. Noirtier, had so much\nastonished everyone, that the position of Madame de Villefort, left\nalone with the notary and the witnesses, became every moment more\nembarrassing. Determined to bear it no longer, she arose and left the\nroom; saying she would go and make some inquiries into the cause of his\nsudden disappearance.\n\nM. de Villefort’s communications on the subject were very limited and\nconcise; he told her, in fact, that an explanation had taken place\nbetween M. Noirtier, M. d’Épinay, and himself, and that the marriage of\nValentine and Franz would conseq"}, {"chunk_id": 179, "text": ", and let my gratitude remain in obscurity like your\ngood deeds.”\n\n20064m\n\n\n\nAnd with a smile expressive of supreme content, he left his\nhiding-place, and without being observed, descended one of the flights\nof steps provided for debarkation, and hailing three times, shouted\n“Jacopo, Jacopo, Jacopo!”\n\nThen a launch came to shore, took him on board, and conveyed him to a\nyacht splendidly fitted up, on whose deck he sprung with the activity\nof a sailor; thence he once again looked towards Morrel, who, weeping\nwith joy, was shaking hands most cordially with all the crowd around\nhim, and thanking with a look the unknown benefactor whom he seemed to\nbe seeking in the skies.\n\n“And now,” said the unknown, “farewell kindness, humanity, and\ngratitude! Farewell to all the feelings that expand the heart! I have\nbeen Heaven’s substitute to recompense the good—now the god of\nvengeance yields to me his power to punish the wicked!”\n\nAt these words he gave a signal, and, as if only awaiting this signal,\nthe yacht instantly put out to sea.\n\n\n\n Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor\n\nTowards the beginning of the year 1838, two young men belonging to the\nfirst society of Paris, the Viscount Albert de Morcerf and the Baron\nFranz d’Épinay, were at Florence. They had agreed to see the Carnival\nat Rome that year, and that Franz, who for the last three or four years\nhad inhabited Italy, should act as _cicerone_ to Albert.\n\nAs it is no inconsiderable affair to spend the Carnival at Rome,\nespecially when you have no great desire to sleep on the Piazza del\nPopolo, or the Campo Vaccino, they wrote to Signor Pastrini, the\nproprietor of the Hôtel de Londres, Piazza di Spagna, to reserve\ncomfortable apartments for them. Signor Pastrini replied that he had\nonly two rooms and a parlor on the third floor, which he offered at the\nlow charge of a louis per diem. They accepted his offer; but wishing to\nmake the best use of the time that was left, Albert started for Naples.\nAs for Franz, he remained at Florence, and after having passed a few\ndays in exploring the paradise of the Cascine, and spending two or\nthree evenings at the houses of the Florentine nobility, he took a\nfancy into his head (having already visited Corsica, the cradle of\nBonaparte) to visit Elba, the waiting-place of Napoleon.\n\nOne evening he cast off the painter of a sailboat from the iron ring\nthat secured it to the dock at Leghorn, wrapped himself in his coat and\nlay down, and said to the crew,—“To the Island of Elba!”\n\nThe boat shot out of the harbor like a bird and the next morning Franz\ndisembarked at Porto-Ferrajo. He traversed the island, after having\nfollowed the traces which the footsteps of the giant have left, and\nre-embarked for Marciana.\n\nTwo hours after he again landed at Pianosa, where he was assured that\nred partridges abounded. The sport was bad; Franz only succeeded in\nkilling a few partridges, and, like every unsuccessful sportsman, he\nreturned to the boat very much out of temper.\n\n“Ah, if your excellency chose,” said the captain, “you might have\ncapital sport.”\n\n“Where?”\n\n“Do you see that island?” continued the captain, pointing to a conical\npile rising from the indigo sea.\n\n“Well, what is this island?”\n\n“The Island of Monte Cristo.”\n\n“But I have no permission to shoot over this island.”\n\n“Your excellency does not require a permit, for the island is\nuninhabited.”\n\n“Ah, indeed!” said the young man. “A desert island in the midst of the\nMediterranean must be a curiosity.”\n\n“It is very natural; this island is a mass of rocks, and does not\ncontain an acre of land capable of cultivation.”\n\n“To whom does this island belong?”\n\n“To Tuscany.”\n\n“What game shall I find there!”\n\n“Thousands of wild goats.”\n\n“Who live upon the stones, I suppose,” said Franz with an incredulous\nsmile.\n\n“No, but by browsing the shrubs and trees that grow out of the crevices\nof the rocks.”\n\n“Where can I sleep?”\n\n“On shore in the grottos, or on board in your cloak; besides, if your\nexcellency pleases, we can leav"}]}

In two days I\nshall be on board the Duncan, and in six at Twofold Bay. There is the\nplace of meeting. The lord's party will be still fast in the marshes\nof the Snowy. Cross the river at Kemple Pier bridge, go to the coast,\nand wait for me. I will find means to bring you on board. With the\ncrew once at sea, and a vessel like the Duncan, we shall be masters\nof the Indian Ocean.' 'Hurrah for Ben Joyce!' cried the convicts.\nMulready's horse was then led up, and Ben Joyce disappeared at a gallop\non the Lucknow road, while the band proceeded southeastward to the\nSnowy River. Mulready, although severely wounded, had strength to drag\nhimself within two hundred paces of the encampment, where we picked him\nup almost dead. This,\" added MacNabb, \"is Mulready's sad story. You\nunderstand now why the courageous sailor wished so much to speak.\"\n\nThis revelation terrified all.\n\n\"Pirates! pirates!\" cried Glenarvan. \"My crew massacred, my Duncan in\nthe hands of these bandits!\"\n\n\"Yes, for Ben Joyce will surprise the vessel,\" replied the major, \"and\nthen----\"\n\n\"Well, we must reach the coast before these wretches,\" said Paganel.\n\n\"But how cross the Snowy?\" asked Wilson.\n\n\"Like them,\" answered Glenarvan. \"They will cross Kemple Pier bridge,\nand we will do the same.\"\n\n\"But what will become of Mulready?\" inquired Lady Helena.\n\n\"We will take turns in carrying him. Shall I give up my defenceless\ncrew to Ben Joyce's band?\"\n\nThe plan of crossing Kemple Pier bridge was practicable, but perilous.\nThe convicts might locate themselves at this point to defend it. It\nwould be at least thirty against seven! But there are moments when we\ndo not think of these things, when we must advance at all hazards.\n\n\"My lord,\" said Captain Mangles, at length, \"before risking our\nlast chance, before venturing towards the bridge, it is prudent to\nreconnoitre it first. I will undertake this.\"\n\n\"I will accompany you, captain,\" replied Paganel.\n\n[Sidenote: THE BURNED BRIDGE.]\n\nThis proposal was accepted, and the captain and Paganel prepared to\nstart immediately. They were to follow along the bank of the river till\nthey came to the place indicated by Ben Joyce, and keep out of sight\nof the convicts, who were probably lying in wait. These two courageous\nmen accordingly, well furnished with arms and provisions, set out, and\nsoon disappeared among the tall rushes of the river.\n\n[Illustration: The animal reared. Mulready seized his revolver and\nfired.]\n\nAll day the little party waited for them. At evening they had not yet\nreturned, and great fears were entertained. At last, about eleven\no'clock, Wilson announced their approach. They arrived, worn out with\nthe fatigues of a six-mile journey.\n\n\"The bridge? Is it there?\" asked Glenarvan, rushing to meet them.\n\n\"Yes, a bridge of rushes,\" said Captain Mangles. \"The convicts passed,\nit is true, but----\"\n\n\"But what?\" cried Glenarvan, who foresaw a new calamity.\n\n\"They burned it after their passage,\" replied Paganel.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIII.\n\nHELPLESS AND HOPELESS.\n\n\nIt was not the time to despair, but to act. If Kemple Pier bridge was\ndestroyed, they must cross the Snowy at all events, and reach Twofold\nBay before Ben Joyce's band. They lost no time, therefore, in vain\nwords; but the next day Captain Mangles and Glenarvan went to examine\nthe river, preparatory to a passage.\n\nThe tumultuous waters, swollen by the rains, had not subsided. They\nwhirled along with indescribable fury. It was certain death to brave\nthis torrent. Glenarvan, with folded arms and lowered head, stood\nmotionless.\n\n\"Do you wish me to try to swim to the opposite bank?\" asked Captain\nMangles.\n\n\"No, John,\" replied Glenarvan, seizing the bold young man by the hand;\n\"let us wait.\"\n\nThey both returned to the encampment. The day was passed in the most\nlively anxiety. Ten times did Glenarvan return to the river. He sought\nto contrive some bold plan of crossing it, but in va"}, {"chunk_id": 142, "text": " brandy, and\nwhisky of his tavern, and scarcely ever saw any one but squatters or\nherdsmen.\n\nHe replied in an ill-humored way to the questions that were addressed\nhim; but his answers sufficed to determine Ayrton upon his course.\nGlenarvan, however, remunerated the tavern-keeper for the little\ntrouble they had given him, and was about to leave the inn, when a\nplacard, affixed to the wall, attracted his attention. It was a notice\nof the colonial police, detailing the escape of the convicts from\nPerth, and setting a price upon the head of Ben Joyce--a hundred pounds\nsterling to any one who should deliver him up.\n\n\"Indeed,\" said Glenarvan, \"that is a rascal worth hanging.\"\n\n\"And especially worth taking,\" replied Ayrton. \"A hundred pounds! What\na sum! He is not worth it.\"\n\n\"As for the inn-keeper,\" added Glenarvan, as he left the room, \"I\nscarcely put faith in him, despite his placard.\"\n\n\"Nor I either,\" said Ayrton.\n\nGlenarvan and the quartermaster rejoined the party, and they all\nproceeded to where a narrow pass wound across the chain. Here they\nbegan the ascent.\n\n[Sidenote: ANOTHER DEATH.]\n\nBut it was an arduous task. More than once the ladies and their\ncompanions had to dismount, and it was often necessary to push the\nwheels of the heavy vehicle at some steep ascent, or to hold it\nback along the edge of some dangerous precipice. The oxen, as they\ncould not work to advantage at sudden turns, had frequently to be\nunyoked, and the cart blocked to prevent it from sliding back. Ayrton\nwas repeatedly forced to bring the already exhausted horses to his\nassistance.\n\nWhether this exertion was too prolonged, or whether from some other\ncause, one of the horses gave out during the ascent. He fell suddenly,\nwithout an instant's warning. It was Mulready's horse; and when the\nsailor attempted to help him up, he found that he was dead. Ayrton\nexamined the animal carefully, but did not seem to understand the cause\nof this sudden death.\n\n\"The beast must have burst a blood-vessel,\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\"Evidently,\" replied Ayrton.\n\n\"Take my horse, Mulready,\" added Glenarvan; \"I will join Lady Helena in\nthe cart.\"\n\nMulready obeyed, and the little party continued their fatiguing ascent,\nabandoning the body to the crows.\n\nThe next day they began the descent, which was much more rapid. During\nits course a violent hail-storm burst on them, and they were forced to\nseek a shelter beneath the rocks. Not hailstones, but pieces of ice as\nlarge as one's hand, were precipitated from the angry clouds. A sling\ncould not have hurled them with greater force, and several sharp blows\nwarned Paganel and Robert to be on their guard. The cart was pierced\nthrough in many places: indeed, few roofs could have resisted the fall\nof these cutting missiles, some of which froze to the trunks of the\ntrees. It was necessary to wait for the end of this avalanche, for fear\nof being stoned to death, and it was an hour before the party regained\nthe steep path, still slippery with icy incrustations. At evening the\ncart, considerably shattered, but still firm on its wooden wheels,\ndescended the last slopes of the Alps, between tall solitary pines, and\nreached the plains of Gippsland.\n\n[Illustration: Not hailstones, but pieces of ice as large as one's\nhand, were precipitated from the angry clouds.]\n\n[Sidenote: DIVIDED COUNSELS.]\n\nAll were impatient to gain their destination, the Pacific Ocean,\nwhere the Britannia had been wrecked. There only could traces of the\nshipwrecked seamen be found, and not in these desert regions. Ayrton\nurged Lord Glenarvan to send an order to the Duncan to repair to the\ncoast, that he might have at his disposal all the aid possible in his\nsearch. In his opinion they ought to take advantage of the Lucknow\nroad, which would lead them to Melbourne. Afterwards this might be\ndifficult, for highways leading directly to the capital would be\nabsolutely wanting.\n\nThis advice of the quartermaster seemed reasonable. Paganel seconded\nit. He thought, too, that the yacht woul"}, {"chunk_id": 113, "text": "hed\nthe hospitable dwelling of Mr. O'Moore, where his labor insured him a\ncomfortable livelihood.\n\n\"And if Ayrton is pleased with me,\" said the Irish colonist, when the\nstory was finished, \"I cannot but be pleased with him. He is an honest\nand intelligent man, a good worker, and, if he chooses, this house\nshall long be at his service.\"\n\nAyrton thanked Mr. O'Moore, and waited for further questions. He\nprobably thought, however, that the legitimate curiosity of his hearers\nought to be satisfied. What could he say that had not been repeated\na hundred times already? Glenarvan was, therefore, about to open the\nconversation on a new topic, to profit by the information received from\nAyrton, when the major, addressing him, said:\n\n\"You were quartermaster of the Britannia?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Ayrton.\n\nBut perceiving that a certain feeling of distrust, a doubt, however\nslight, had suggested this inquiry, he added,--\n\n\"I saved my contract from the wreck.\"\n\nHe immediately left the room in search of this authoritative document.\nDuring his absence, which lasted but a few moments, Mr. O'Moore said:\n\n\"My lord, I will answer for it that Ayrton is an honest man. During the\ntwo months that he has been in my employ, I have had no fault to find\nwith him. I knew the story of his shipwreck and captivity. He is a true\nman, and worthy of your entire confidence.\"\n\nGlenarvan was about to answer that he had never doubted Ayrton's\nhonesty, when the latter returned and presented his contract. It was a\npaper signed by the owners of the Britannia and Captain Grant, whose\nwriting Mary recognized immediately. It stated that \"Tom Ayrton, able\nseaman, was engaged as quartermaster on board the brig Britannia of\nGlasgow.\" There was, therefore, no possible doubt of Ayrton's identity,\nfor it would have been difficult to suppose that this contract could be\nin his hands and not belong to him.\n\n[Sidenote: ENTANGLEMENTS.]\n\n\"Now,\" said Glenarvan, \"I appeal to you all for advice as to what is\nbest to be done. Your advice, Ayrton, would be particularly valuable,\nand I should be much obliged if you would give it to us.\"\n\nThe sailor reflected a few moments, and then replied:\n\n\"I thank you, my lord, for the confidence you place in me, and hope to\nshow myself worthy of it. I have some knowledge of the country, and of\nthe customs of the natives; and, if I can be of use to you----\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" replied Glenarvan.\n\n\"I think, like you,\" continued Ayrton, \"that Captain Grant and his two\nsailors were saved from the shipwreck; but, since they have not reached\nthe English possessions, since they have not reappeared, I doubt not\nthat their fate was the same as my own, and that they are prisoners of\nthe natives.\"\n\n\"You repeat, Mr. Ayrton, the arguments that I have already\nsubstantiated,\" said Paganel. \"The shipwrecked seamen are evidently\nprisoners of the natives, as they feared. But ought we to suppose that,\nlike you, they have been carried to the north?\"\n\n\"It is quite likely, sir,\" replied Ayrton. \"The hostile tribes would\nhardly remain in the neighborhood of the English provinces.\"\n\n\"This fact will complicate our search,\" said Glenarvan, quite\ndisconcerted. \"How shall we find the traces of the prisoners in the\ninterior of so vast a continent?\"\n\nA prolonged silence followed this remark. Lady Helena frequently\ncast a questioning glance at her companions, but without eliciting a\nresponsive sign. Paganel himself was silent, contrary to his custom.\nHis usual ingenuity now failed him. Captain Mangles paced the room with\nlong strides, as if he had been on the deck of his vessel, involved in\nsome difficulty.\n\n\"And you, Mr. Ayrton,\" said Lady Helena, at length, to the\nquartermaster, \"what would you do?\"\n\n\"Madam,\" replied he, promptly, \"I should re-embark on board the Duncan,\nand go straight to the place of the shipwreck. There I should act\naccording to circumstances, or indications that chance might furnish.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" said Glenarvan; \"but we must wait till the Duncan is\nrepaired.\"\n\n\"Ah! you"}, {"chunk_id": 217, "text": "What do you mean, Tom?\" inquired Glenarvan.\n\n\"I mean,\" he replied, \"that when the quartermaster, Ayrton, learned,\nthe day after our departure, the Duncan's destination----\"\n\n\"Ayrton!\" cried Glenarvan. \"Is he on board?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord.\"\n\n\"Ayrton here!\" repeated Glenarvan, glancing at Captain Mangles.\n\n\"Wonderful indeed!\" said the young captain.\n\nIn an instant, with the swiftness of lightning, Ayrton's conduct, his\nlong-contrived treachery, Glenarvan's wound, the attack upon Mulready,\ntheir sufferings in the marshes of the Snowy, all the wretch's deeds,\nflashed upon the minds of the two men. And now, by a strange fatality,\nthe convict was in their power.\n\n\"Where is he?\" asked Glenarvan quickly.\n\n\"In a cabin in the forecastle,\" replied Tom Austin, \"closely guarded.\"\n\n\"Why this confinement?\"\n\n[Sidenote: AN UNOFFICIAL TRIBUNAL.]\n\n\"Because, when Ayrton saw that the yacht was sailing for New Zealand,\nhe flew into a passion; because he attempted to force me to change the\nship's course; because he threatened me; and, finally, because he urged\nmy men to a mutiny. I saw that he was a dangerous person, and was\ncompelled, therefore, to take precautions against him.\"\n\n\"And since that time?\"\n\n\"Since that time he has been in his cabin, without offering to come\nout.\"\n\n\"Good!\"\n\nAt this moment Glenarvan and Captain Mangles were summoned to the\nsaloon. Breakfast, which they so much needed, was ready. They took\nseats at the table, but did not speak of Ayrton.\n\nHowever, when the meal was ended, and the passengers had assembled on\ndeck, Glenarvan informed them of the quartermaster's presence on board.\nAt the same time he declared his intention of sending for him.\n\n\"Can I be released from attending this tribunal?\" asked Lady Helena.\n\"I confess to you, my dear Edward, that the sight of this unfortunate\nwould be very painful to me.\"\n\n\"It is only to confront him, Helena,\" replied Glenarvan. \"Remain,\nif you can. Ben Joyce should see himself face to face with all his\nintended victims.\"\n\nLady Helena yielded to this request, and Mary Grant and she took their\nplaces beside him, while around them stood the major, Paganel, Captain\nMangles, Robert, Wilson, Mulready, and Olbinett, all who had suffered\nso severely by the convict's treason. The crew of the yacht, who did\nnot yet understand the seriousness of these proceedings, maintained a\nprofound silence.\n\n\"Call Ayrton!\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVI.\n\nAYRTON'S OBSTINACY.\n\n\nAyrton soon made his appearance. He crossed the deck with a confident\nstep, and ascended the poop-stairs. His eyes had a sullen look, his\nteeth were set, and his fists clinched convulsively. His bearing\ndisplayed neither exultation nor humility. As soon as he was in Lord\nGlenarvan's presence, he folded his arms, and calmly and silently\nwaited to be questioned:\n\n\"Ayrton,\" said Glenarvan, \"here we all are, as you see, on board the\nDuncan, that you would have surrendered to Ben Joyce's accomplices.\"\n\nAt these words the lips of the quartermaster slightly trembled. A quick\nblush colored his hard features,--not the sign of remorse, but the\nshame of defeat. He was prisoner on this yacht that he had meant to\ncommand as master, and his fate was soon to be decided.\n\nHowever, he made no reply. Glenarvan waited patiently, but Ayrton still\npersisted in maintaining an obstinate silence.\n\n\"Speak, Ayrton; what have you to say?\" continued Glenarvan.\n\nThe convict hesitated, and the lines of his forehead were strongly\ncontracted. At last he said, in a calm voice:\n\n\"I have nothing to say, my lord. I was foolish enough to let myself be\ntaken. Do what you please.\"\n\n[Sidenote: A DUMB PRISONER.]\n\nHaving given his answer, the quartermaster turned his eyes toward\nthe coast that extended along the west, and affected a profound\nindifference for all that was passing around him. You would have\nthought, to look at him, that he was a stranger to this serious affair.\n\nBut Glenarvan had resolved to be patient.

A few boldly-struck chords wafted\nto his ears their harmonious vibrations.

Paganel said nothing to the sailor, but, reserving\nhis account of the incident for Glenarvan the next day, he crept into\nthe tent.\n\nIn the morning the whole party were awakened by unexpected bayings.\nGlenarvan at once arose. Two magnificent pointers were gamboling along\nthe edge of a small wood; but at the approach of the travelers they\ndisappeared among the trees, barking loudly.\n\n\"There must be a station in this desert,\" said Glenarvan, \"and hunters,\nsince those are hunting-dogs.\"\n\nPaganel was just about to relate his experiences of the past night,\nwhen two men appeared, in hunting costume, mounted on fine horses. They\nnaturally stopped at sight of the little party, encamped in gypsy-like\nfashion, and seemed to be wondering what the presence of armed men in\nthis place meant, when they perceived the ladies, who were alighting\nfrom the cart.\n\nThey immediately dismounted, and advanced towards them, hat in hand.\nGlenarvan went to meet them, and introduced himself and party, giving\nthe name and rank of each member. The young men bowed, and one of them,\nthe elder, said:\n\n\"My lord, will your ladies, your companions, and yourself do us the\nhonor to accompany us to our house?\"\n\n\"May I ask, gentlemen, whom I have the honor of addressing?\" inquired\nGlenarvan.\n\n\"Michael and Alexander Patterson, proprietors of Hottam Station. You\nare already on the grounds of the establishment, and have but a quarter\nof a mile to go.\"\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" replied Glenarvan, \"I should be unwilling to slight a\nhospitality so graciously offered----\"\n\n\"My lord,\" interrupted Michael Patterson, \"by accepting you will confer\na favor upon two poor colonists, who will be only too happy to extend\nto you the honors of the desert.\"\n\nGlenarvan bowed in token of assent.\n\n\"Sir,\" said Paganel, addressing Michael Patterson, \"should I be too\ninquisitive were I to ask if it was you who sang that divine air of\nMozart last night?\"\n\n\"It was I, sir,\" replied the gentleman; \"and my brother "}, {"chunk_id": 158, "text": "of a mile distant. Glenarvan, pushing back MacNabb,\nwas advancing along the path, when, not far from the cart, these words\nwere uttered:\n\n\"Help! help!\"\n\nIt was a plaintive and despairing voice. Captain Mangles and the major\nrushed towards it. In a few moments they perceived, on the edge of\nthe coppice, a human form that was dragging itself along and groaning\npiteously. It was Mulready, wounded and half dead. When his companions\nraised him, they felt their hands dabbling in blood. The rain now\nincreased, and the wind howled through the branches of the dead trees.\nIn the midst of these terrific gusts, Glenarvan, the major, and the\ncaptain bore the body of Mulready.\n\nOn arriving at the cart, Paganel, Robert, Wilson, and Olbinett came\nout, and Lady Helena gave up her room to the poor sailor. The major\ntook off Mulready's vest, wet with blood and rain. He discovered the\nwound. It was a poniard stab, which the unfortunate had received in his\nright side.\n\nMacNabb dressed it skillfully. Whether the weapon had reached the vital\nparts, he could not say. A stream of bright-red blood spurted forth,\nwhile the paleness and the swoon of the wounded man proved that he had\nbeen seriously injured. The major accordingly placed upon the opening\nof the wound, after first washing it with fresh water, a thick wad of\ntinder, and then a few layers of lint, confined by a bandage, and thus\nsucceeded in stopping the hemorrhage. The patient was then laid on his\nside, his head and breast raised, and Lady Helena gave him a refreshing\ndraught.\n\nAt the end of a quarter of an hour, the wounded man, who had been\nmotionless till then, made a movement. His eyes half opened, his lips\nmurmured disconnected words, and the major, putting down his ear, heard\nhim say:\n\n\"My lord--the letter--Ben Joyce----\"\n\n[Sidenote: A DAY OF DOUBT.]\n\nThe major repeated these words, and glanced at his companions. What did\nMulready mean? Ben Joyce had attacked the sailor, but why? Was it not\nsimply for the purpose of preventing him from reaching the Duncan? This\nletter--Glenarvan examined the sailor's pockets. The letter addressed\nto Tom Austin was gone.\n\nThe night passed in anxiety and anguish. They feared every moment that\nthe wounded man would die. A burning fever consumed him. Lady Helena\nand Mary Grant, as though his sisters, did not leave him; never was\npatient better nursed, or by more tender hands.\n\nDay appeared. The rain had ceased. Heavy clouds still rolled along\nthe vault of the sky, and the earth was strewn with the fragments of\nbranches. The clay, soaked by floods of water, had yielded; and the\nsides of the cart became unsteady, but sank no deeper.\n\nCaptain Mangles, Paganel, and Glenarvan took a tour of exploration\naround the camp. They traversed the path still marked with blood, but\nfound no trace of Ben Joyce or his band. They went to the place where\nthe attack had been made. Here two corpses lay on the ground, shot\nby Mulready. One was the farrier of Black Point. His face, which had\nmortified, was a horrible sight.\n\nGlenarvan did not pursue his investigations farther, prudence\nforbidding. He therefore returned to the cart, much alarmed by the\nseriousness of the situation.\n\n\"We cannot think of sending another messenger to Melbourne,\" said he.\n\n\"But we must,\" replied Captain Mangles; \"and I will make the attempt,\nsince my sailor has failed.\"\n\n\"No, John. You have not even a horse to carry you these two hundred\nmiles.\"\n\nIndeed, Mulready's horse, the only one that remained, had not\nreappeared. Had he fallen beneath the shots of the murderers? Was he\nrunning wild over the desert? Had the convicts captured him?\n\n[Illustration: In the midst of these terrific gusts, Glenarvan, the\nmajor, and the captain bore the body of Mulready.]\n\n[Sidenote: RESOLUTION, AND RECOVERY.]\n\n\"Whatever happens,\" continued Glenarvan, \"we will separate no more.\nLet us wait eight or fifteen days, till the waters of the river resume\ntheir natural level.

He wore a traveling\ncap, stout yellow buskins and leather gaiters, pantaloons of maroon\nvelvet, and a jacket of the same material, whose innumerable pockets\nseemed stuffed with note-books, memoranda, scraps, portfolios, and a\nthousand articles as inconvenient as they were useless, not to speak\nof a telescope which he carried in a sling.\n\nThe curiosity of this unknown being was a singular contrast to the\ncalmness of the major. He walked around MacNabb, and gazed at him\nquestioningly, whilst the latter did not trouble himself whence the\nstranger came, whither he was going, or why he was on board the Duncan.\n\nWhen this enigmatical character saw his approaches mocked by the\nindifference of the major, he seized his telescope, which at its full\nlength measured four feet; and motionless, with legs straddled, like a\nsign-post on a highway, he pointed his instrument to the line where sky\nand water met. After a few moments of examination, he lowered it, and\nresting it on the deck, leaned upon it as upon a cane. But immediately\nthe joints of the instrument closed, and the newly discovered\npassenger, whose point of support suddenly failed, was stretched at the\nfoot of the mainmast.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nAny one else in the major's place would at least have smiled, but he\ndid not even wink. The unknown then assumed his rôle.\n\n\"Steward!\" he cried, with an accent that betokened a foreigner.\n\nHe waited. No one appeared.\n\n\"Steward!\" he repeated, in a louder tone.\n\nMr. Olbinett was passing just then on his way to the kitchen under the\nforecastle. What was his astonishment to hear himself thus addressed by\nthis tall individual, who was utterly unknown to him!\n\n\"Where did this person come from?\" said he to himself. \"A friend of\nLord Glenarvan? It is impossible.\"\n\nHowever, he came on deck, and approached the stranger.\n\n\"Are you the steward of the vessel?\" the latter asked him.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Olbinett; \"but I have not the honor----\"\n\n\"I am the passenger of cabin number six.\"\n\n\"Number six?\" repeated the steward.\n\n\"Certainly; and your name is----?\"\n\n\"Olbinett.\"\n\n\"Well, Olbinett, my friend,\" answered the stranger of cabin number six,\n\"I must think of dinner, and acutely, too. For thirty-six hours I have\neaten nothing, or, rather, have slept, which is pardonable in a man\ncome all the way from Paris to Glasgow. What hour do you dine, if you\nplease?\"\n\n\"At nine o'clock,\" answered Olbinett, mechanically.\n\nThe stranger attempted to consult his watch; but this took some time,\nfor he did not find it till he came to his ninth pocket.\n\n[Sidenote: CONFUSION WORSE CONFOUNDED.]\n\n\"Well,\" said he, \"it is not yet eight o'clock; therefore, Olbinett, a\nbiscuit and a glass of sherry for the present; for I am fainting with\nhunger.\"\n\nOlbinett listened without understanding. Moreover, the unknown kept\ntalking, and passed from one subject to another with extreme volubility.\n\n\"Well,\" said he, \"has not the captain risen yet? And the mate? What is\nhe doing? Is he asleep, too? Fortunately, the weather is beautiful, the\nwind favorable, and the ship goes on quite by herself----\"\n\nJust as he said this, Captain Mangles appeared at the companion-way.\n\n\"Here is the captain,\" said Olbinett.\n\n\"Ah, I am delighted,\" cried the stranger, \"delighted to make your\nacquaintance, Captain Burton!\"\n\nIf any one was ever astounded, John Mangles certainly was, not less at\nhearing himself called \"Captain Burton,\" than at seeing this stranger\non board his vessel.\n\nThe latter continued, with more animation:\n\n\"Permit me to shake hands with you, and if I did not do so day before\nyesterday, it was that no one might be embarrassed at the moment of\ndeparture. But to-day, captain, I am truly happy to meet you.\"\n\nCaptain Mangles opened his eyes in measureless astonishment, looking\nfirst at Olbinett, and then at the new comer.\n\n\"Now,\" continued the latter, \"the introduction is"}, {"chunk_id": 216, "text": "ajor, greatly puzzled.\n\n\"Yes, Mr. MacNabb,\" replied Austin. \"I will soon bring it.\"\n\nHe accordingly repaired to his own cabin. While he was gone, they gazed\nat each other in silence, except the major, who, with his eye fixed\nupon Paganel, said, as he folded his arms:\n\n\"Indeed, I must confess, Paganel, that this is a little too much.\"\n\nAt this moment Austin returned. He held in his hand the letter written\nby Paganel, and signed by Glenarvan.\n\n\"Read it, my lord,\" said the old sailor.\n\nGlenarvan took the letter, and read:\n\n\"Order for Tom Austin to put to sea, and bring the Duncan to the\neastern coast of New Zealand.\"\n\n\"New Zealand?\" cried Paganel, starting.\n\nHe snatched the letter from Glenarvan's hands, rubbed his eyes,\nadjusted his spectacles to his nose, and read in his turn.\n\n\"New Zealand!\" repeated he, in an indescribable tone, while the letter\nslipped from his fingers.\n\nJust then he felt a hand fall upon his shoulder. He turned, and found\nhimself face to face with the major.\n\n[Sidenote: PAGANEL IN THE WITNESS-BOX.]\n\n\"Well, my good Paganel,\" said MacNabb, in a grave tone, \"it is\nfortunate that you did not send the Duncan to Cochin-China.\"\n\nThis sally finished the poor geographer. A fit of laughter seized the\nwhole crew. Paganel, as if mad, ran to and fro, holding his head in his\nhands, and tearing his hair. However, when he had recovered from his\nfrenzy, there was still another unavoidable question to answer.\n\n\"Now, Paganel,\" said Glenarvan, \"be candid. I acknowledge that your\nabsent-mindedness has been providential. To be sure, without you the\nDuncan would have fallen into the hands of the convicts; without you we\nshould have been recaptured by the Maoris. But do tell me, what strange\nassociation of ideas, what unnatural aberration, induced you to write\nNew Zealand instead of Australia?\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Paganel. \"It was----\"\n\nBut at that moment his eyes fell upon Robert and Mary Grant, and he\nstopped short, finally replying:\n\n\"Never mind, my dear Glenarvan. I am a madman, a fool, an incorrigible\nbeing, and shall die a most famous blunderer!\"\n\nThe affair was no longer discussed. The mystery of the Duncan's\npresence there was solved; and the travelers, so miraculously saved,\nthought only of revisiting their comfortable cabins and partaking of a\ngood breakfast.\n\nHowever, leaving Lady Helena, Mary Grant, the major, Paganel, and\nRobert to enter the saloon, Glenarvan and Captain Mangles retained Tom\nAustin with them. They wished to question him further.\n\n\"Now, Tom,\" said Glenarvan, \"let me know: did not this order to sail\nfor the coast of New Zealand seem strange to you?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord,\" replied Austin. \"I was very much surprised; but, as I\nam not in the habit of discussing the orders I receive, I obeyed. Could\nI act otherwise? If any accident had happened from not following your\ninstructions, should I not have been to blame? Would you have done\ndifferently, captain?\"\n\n\"No, Tom,\" answered Captain Mangles.\n\n\"But what did you think?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"I thought, my lord, that, in the cause of Captain Grant, it was\nnecessary to go wherever you directed me; that by some combination of\ncircumstances another vessel would take you to New Zealand, and that\nI was to wait for you on the eastern coast of the island. Moreover,\non leaving Melbourne, I kept my destination secret, and the crew did\nnot know it till we were out at sea and the shores of Australia had\ndisappeared from sight. But then an incident occurred that perplexed me\nvery much.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, Tom?\" inquired Glenarvan.\n\n\"I mean,\" he replied, \"that when the quartermaster, Ayrton, learned,\nthe day after our departure, the Duncan's destination----\"\n\n\"Ayrton!\" cried Glenarvan. \"Is he on board?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord.\"\n\n\"Ayrton here!\" repeated Glenarvan, glancing at Captain Mangles.\n\n\"Wonderful indeed!\" said the young captain.\n\nIn an instant, with the swiftness of lightning, Ayrton's conduct, his\nlong-contrived treachery, Glenarvan's wound, the attack upon Mulready,\ntheir suffer"}]}

Come,\nnow, I have hopes of obtaining what I have been for years endeavoring\nto persuade the marquise to promise; namely, a perfect amnesty and\nforgetfulness of the past.”\n\n“With all my heart,” replied the marquise; “let the past be forever\nforgotten. I promise you it affords _me_ as little pleasure to revive\nit as it does you. All I ask is, that Villefort will be firm and\ninflexible for the future in his political principles. Remember, also,\nVillefort, that we have pledged ourselves to his majesty for your\nfealty and strict loyalty, and that at our recommendation the king\nconsented to forget the past, as I do” (and here she extended to him\nher hand)—“as I now do at your entreaty. But bear in mind, that should\nthere fall in your way anyone guilty of conspiring against the\ngovernment, you will be so much the more bound to visit the offence\nwith rigorous punishment, as it is known you belong to a suspected\nfamily.”\n\n“Alas, madame,” returned Villefort, “my profession, as well as the\ntimes in which we live, compels me to be severe.

As Villefort observes, it is a great act of folly\nto have left such a man between Corsica, where he was born, and Naples,\nof which his brother-in-law is king, and face to face with Italy, the\nsovereignty of which he coveted for his son.”\n\n“Unfortunately,” said Villefort, “there are the treaties of 1814, and\nwe cannot molest Napoleon without breaking those compacts.”\n\n“Oh, well, we"}, {"chunk_id": 505, "text": "g but useless documents.\n\n“Shall I open the secretaire?” asked Valentine.\n\n“Yes,” said the old man.\n\n“And the drawers?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Those at the side?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“The middle one?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nValentine opened it and drew out a bundle of papers. “Is that what you\nwish for?” asked she.\n\n“No.”\n\nShe took successively all the other papers out till the drawer was\nempty. “But there are no more,” said she. Noirtier’s eye was fixed on\nthe dictionary.\n\n“Yes, I understand, grandfather,” said the young girl.\n\n40036m\n\n\n\nShe pointed to each letter of the alphabet. At the letter S the old man\nstopped her. She opened, and found the word “secret.”\n\n“Ah! is there a secret spring?” said Valentine.\n\n“Yes,” said Noirtier.\n\n“And who knows it?” Noirtier looked at the door where the servant had\ngone out.\n\n“Barrois?” said she.\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Shall I call him?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nValentine went to the door, and called Barrois. Villefort’s impatience\nduring this scene made the perspiration roll from his forehead, and\nFranz was stupefied. The old servant came.\n\n“Barrois,” said Valentine, “my grandfather has told me to open that\ndrawer in the secretaire, but there is a secret spring in it, which you\nknow—will you open it?”\n\nBarrois looked at the old man. “Obey,” said Noirtier’s intelligent eye.\nBarrois touched a spring, the false bottom came out, and they saw a\nbundle of papers tied with a black string.\n\n“Is that what you wish for?” said Barrois.\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Shall I give these papers to M. de Villefort?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“To Mademoiselle Valentine?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“To M.

I am in a\nhurry to begin. I want to learn.”\n\n“Everything,” said the abbé. And that very evening the prisoners\nsketched a plan of education, to be entered upon the following day.\nDantès possessed a prodigious memory, combined with an astonishing\nquickness and readiness of conception; the mathematical turn of his\nmind rendered him apt at all kinds of calculation, while his naturally\npoetical feelings threw a light and pleasing veil over the dry reality\nof arithmetical computation, or the rigid severity of geometry. He\nalready knew Italian, and had also picked up a little of the Romaic\ndialect during voyages to the East; and by the aid of these two\nlanguages he easily comprehended the construction of all the others, so\nthat at the end of six months he began to speak Spanish, English, and\nGerman.\n\nIn strict accordance with the promise made to the abbé, Dantès spoke no\nmore of escape. Perhaps the delight his studies afforded him left no\nroom for such thoughts; perhaps the recollection that he had pledged\nhis word (on which his sense of honor was keen) kept him from referring\nin any way to the possibilities of flight. Days, even months, passed by\nunheeded in one rapid and instructive course. At the end of a year\nDantès was a new man. Dantès observed, however, that Faria, in spite of\nthe relief his society afforded, daily grew sadder; one thought seemed\nincessantly to harass and distract his mind. Sometimes he would fall\ninto long reveries, sigh heavily and involuntarily, then suddenly rise,\nand, with folded arms, begin pacing the confined space of his dungeon.\nOne day he stopped all at once, and exclaimed:\n\n“Ah, if there were no sentinel!”\n\n“There shall not be one a minute longer than you please,” said Dantès,\nwho had followed the working of his thoughts as accurately as though\nhis brain were enclosed in crystal so clear as to display its minutest\noperations.\n\n“I have already told you,” answered the abbé, “that I loathe the idea\nof shedding blood.”\n\n“And yet the murder, if you choose to call it so, would be simply a\nmeasure of self-preservation.”\n\n“No matter! I could never agree to it.”\n\n“Still, you have thought of it?”\n\n“Incessantly, alas!” cried the abbé.\n\n“And you have discovered a means of regaining our freedom, have you\nnot?” asked Dantès eagerly.\n\n“I have; if it were only possible to place a deaf and blind sentinel in\nthe gallery beyond us.”\n\n“He shall be both blind and deaf,” replied the young man, with an air\nof determination that made his companion shudder.\n\n“No, no,” cried the abbé; “impossible!”\n\nDantès endeavored to renew the subject; the abbé shook his head in\ntoken of disapproval, and refused to make any further response.

The young man, in\nreply, took up the chisel, bent it into the form of a horseshoe, and\nthen as readily straightened it.\n\n“And will you engage not to do any harm to the sentry, except as a last\nresort?”\n\n“I promise on my honor.”\n\n“Then,” said the abbé, “we may hope to put our design into execution.”\n\n“And how long shall we be in accomplishing the necessary work?”\n\n“At least a year.”\n\n“And shall we begin at once?”\n\n“At once.”\n\n“We have lost a year to no purpose!” cried Dantès.\n\n“Do you consider the last twelve months to have been wasted?” asked the\nabbé.\n\n“Forgive me!” cried Edmond, blushing deeply.\n\n“Tut, tut!” answered the abbé, “man is but man after all, and you are\nabout the best specimen of the genus I have ever known.

You will find yesterday’s report of the minister of\npolice. But here is M. Dandré himself;” and M. Dandré, announced by the\nchamberlain-in-waiting, entered.\n\n“Come in,” said Louis XVIII., with repressed smile, “come in, Baron,\nand tell the duke all you know—the latest news of M. de Bonaparte; do\nnot conceal anything, however serious,—let us see, the Island of Elba\nis a volcano, and we may expect to have issuing thence flaming and\nbristling war—_bella, horrida bella_.”\n\nM. Dandré leaned very respectfully on the back of a chair with his two\nhands, and said:\n\n“Has your majesty perused yesterday’s report?”\n\n“Yes, yes; but tell the duke himself, who cannot find anything, what\nthe report contains—give him the particulars of what the usurper is\ndoing in his islet.”\n\n“Monsieur,” said the baron to the duke, “all the servants of his\nmajesty must approve of the latest intelligence which we have from the\nIsland of Elba.

Dandré looked at Louis XVIII., who, employed in writing a note, did\nnot even raise his head. “Bonaparte,” continued the baron, “is mortally\nwearied, and passes whole days in watching his miners at work at\nPorto-Longone.”\n\n“And scratches himself for amusement,” added the king.\n\n“Scratches himself?” inquired the duke, “what does your majesty mean?”\n\n“Yes, indeed, my dear duke.

He struck\nthrice.\n\nAt the first blow the sound ceased, as if by magic.\n\nEdmond listened intently; an hour passed, two hours passed, and no\nsound was heard from the wall—all was silent there.\n\nFull of hope, Edmond swallowed a few mouthfuls of bread and water, and,\nthanks to the vigor of his constitution, found himself well-nigh\nrecovered.\n\nThe day passed away in utter silence—night came without recurrence of\nthe noise.\n\n“It is a prisoner,” said Edmond joyfully. His brain was on fire, and\nlife and energy returned.\n\nThe night passed in perfect silence. Edmond did not close his eyes.\n\nIn the morning the jailer brought him fresh provisions—he had already\ndevoured those of the previous day; he ate these listening anxiously\nfor the sound, walking round and round his cell, shaking the iron bars\nof the loophole, restoring vigor and agility to his limbs by exercise,\nand so preparing himself for his future destiny.

He\nmoved away, walked up and down his cell to collect his thoughts, and\nthen went back and listened.\n\nThe matter was no longer doubtful. Something was at work on the other\nside of the wall; the prisoner had discovered the danger, and had\nsubstituted a lever for a chisel.\n\nEncouraged by this discovery, Edmond determined to assist the\nindefatigable laborer. He began by moving his bed, and looked around\nfor anything with which he could pierce the wall, penetrate the moist\ncement, and displace a stone.\n\nHe saw nothing, he had no knife or sharp instrument, the window grating\nwas of iron, but he had too often assured himself of its solidity. All\nhis furniture consisted of a bed, a chair, a table, a pail, and a jug.\nThe bed had iron clamps, but they were screwed to the wood, and it\nwould have required a screw-driver to take them off. The table and\nchair had nothing, the pail had once possessed a handle, but that had\nbeen removed.\n\n0189m\n\n\n\nDantès had but one resource, which was to break the jug, and with one\nof the sharp fragments attack the wall. He let the jug fall on the\nfloor, and it broke in pieces.\n\nDantès concealed two or three of the sharpest fragments in his bed,\nleaving the rest on the floor. The breaking of his jug was too natural\nan accident to excite suspicion. Edmond had all the night to work in,\nbut in the darkness he could not do much, and he soon felt that he was\nworking against something very hard; he pushed back his bed, and waited\nfor day.\n\nAll night he heard the subterranean workman, who continued to mine his\nway. Day came, the jailer entered. Dantès told him that the jug had\nfallen from his hands while he was drinking, and the jailer went\ngrumblingly to fetch another, without giving himself the trouble to\nremove the fragments of the broken one. He returned speedily, advised\nthe prisoner to be more careful, and departed.\n\nDantès heard joyfully the key grate in the lock; he listened until the\nsound of steps died away, and then, hastily displacing his bed, saw by\nthe faint light that penetrated into his cell, that he had labored\nuselessl"}]}

The Villefort Family Vault\n\nTwo days after, a considerable crowd was assembled, towards ten o’clock\nin the morning, around the door of M. de Villefort’s house, and a long\nfile of mourning-coaches and private carriages extended along the\nFaubourg Saint-Honoré and the Rue de la Pépinière. Among them was one\nof a very singular form, which appeared to have come from a distance.\nIt was a kind of covered wagon, painted black, and was one of the first\nto arrive. Inquiry was made, and it was ascertained that, by a strange\ncoincidence, this carriage contained the corpse of the Marquis de\nSaint-Méran, and that those who had come thinking to attend one funeral\nwould follow two. Their number was great. The Marquis de Saint-Méran,\none of the most zealous and faithful dignitaries of Louis XVIII. and\nKing Charles X., had preserved a great number of friends, and these,\nadded to the personages whom the usages of society gave Villefort a\nclaim on, formed a considerable body.\n\nDue information was given to the authorities, and permission obtained\nthat the two funerals should take place at the same time. A second\nhearse, decked with the same funereal pomp, was brought to M. de\nVillefort’s door, and the coffin removed into it from the post-wagon.\nThe two bodies were to be interred in the cemetery of Père-Lachaise,\nwhere M. de Villefort had long since had a tomb prepared for the\nreception of his family. The remains of poor Renée were already\ndeposited there, and now, after ten years of separation, her father and\nmother were to be reunited with her.\n\nThe Parisians, always curious, always affected by funereal display,\nlooked on with religious silence while the splendid procession\naccompanied to their last abode two of the number of the old\naristocracy—the greatest protectors of commerce and sincere devotees to\ntheir principles.\n\nIn one of the mourning-coaches Beauchamp, Debray, and Château-Renaud\nwere talking of the very sudden death of the marchioness.\n\n“I saw Madame de Saint-Méran only last year at Marseilles, when I was\ncoming back from Algiers,” said Château-Renaud; “she looked like a\nwoman destined to live to be a hundred years old, from her apparent\nsound health and great activity of mind and body. How old was she?”\n\n“Franz assured me,” replied Albert, “that she was sixty-six years old.\nBut she has not died of old age, but of grief; it appears that since\nthe death of the marquis, which affected her very deeply, she has not\ncompletely recovered her reason.”\n\n“But of what disease, then, did she die?” asked Debray.\n\n“It is said to have been a congestion of the brain, or apoplexy, which\nis the same thing, is it not?”\n\n“Nearly.”\n\n“It is difficult to believe that it was apoplexy,” said Beauchamp.\n“Madame de Saint-Méran, whom I once saw, was short, of slender form,\nand of a much more nervous than sanguine temperament; grief could\nhardly produce apoplexy in such a constitution as that of "}, {"chunk_id": 505, "text": "g but useless documents.\n\n“Shall I open the secretaire?” asked Valentine.\n\n“Yes,” said the old man.\n\n“And the drawers?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Those at the side?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“The middle one?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nValentine opened it and drew out a bundle of papers. “Is that what you\nwish for?” asked she.\n\n“No.”\n\nShe took successively all the other papers out till the drawer was\nempty. “But there are no more,” said she. Noirtier’s eye was fixed on\nthe dictionary.\n\n“Yes, I understand, grandfather,” said the young girl.\n\n40036m\n\n\n\nShe pointed to each letter of the alphabet. At the letter S the old man\nstopped her. She opened, and found the word “secret.”\n\n“Ah! is there a secret spring?” said Valentine.\n\n“Yes,” said Noirtier.\n\n“And who knows it?” Noirtier looked at the door where the servant had\ngone out.\n\n“Barrois?” said she.\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Shall I call him?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nValentine went to the door, and called Barrois. Villefort’s impatience\nduring this scene made the perspiration roll from his forehead, and\nFranz was stupefied. The old servant came.\n\n“Barrois,” said Valentine, “my grandfather has told me to open that\ndrawer in the secretaire, but there is a secret spring in it, which you\nknow—will you open it?”\n\nBarrois looked at the old man. “Obey,” said Noirtier’s intelligent eye.\nBarrois touched a spring, the false bottom came out, and they saw a\nbundle of papers tied with a black string.\n\n“Is that what you wish for?” said Barrois.\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Shall I give these papers to M. de Villefort?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“To Mademoiselle Valentine?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“To M. Franz d’Épinay?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nFranz, astonished, advanced a step. “To me, sir?” said he.\n\n“Yes.”\n\nFranz took them from Barrois and casting a glance at the cover, read:\n\n“‘To be given, after my death, to General Durand, who shall bequeath\nthe packet to his son, with an injunction to preserve it as containing\nan important document.’\n\n“Well, sir,” asked Franz, “what do you wish me to do with this paper?”\n\n“To preserve it, sealed up as it is, doubtless,” said the procureur.\n\n“No,” replied Noirtier eagerly.\n\n“Do you wish him to read it?” said Valentine.\n\n“Yes,” replied the old man.\n\n“You understand, baron, my grandfather wishes you to read this paper,”\nsaid Valentine.\n\n“Then let us sit down,” said Villefort impatiently, “for it will take\nsome time.”\n\n“Sit down,” said the old man. Villefort took a chair, but Valentine\nremained standing by her father’s side, and Franz before him, holding\nthe mysterious paper in his hand. “Read,” said the old man. Franz\nuntied it, and in the midst of the most profound silence read:\n\n40038m\n\n\n\n“‘_Extract of the report of a meeting of the Bonapartist Club in the\nRue Saint-Jacques, held February 5th, 1815_.’”\n\nFranz stopped. “February 5th, 1815!” said he; “it is the day my father\nwas murdered.” Valentine and Villefort were dumb; the eye of the old\nman alone seemed to say clearly, “Go on.”\n\n“But it was on leaving this club,” said he, “my father disappeared.”\n\nNoirtier’s eye continued to say, “Read.” He resumed:—\n\n“‘The undersigned Louis-Jacques Beaurepaire, lieutenant-colonel of\nartillery, Étienne Duchampy, general of brigade, and Claude Lecharpal,\nkeeper of woods and forests, declare, that on the 4th of February, a\nletter arrived from the Island of Elba, recommending to the kindness\nand the confidence of the Bonapartist Club, General Flavien de Quesnel,\nwho having served the emperor from 1804 to 1814 was supposed to be\ndevoted to the interests of the Napoleon dynasty, notwithstanding the\ntitle of baron which Louis XVIII. had just granted to him with his\nestate of Épinay.\n\n400340m\n\n\n\n“‘A note was in consequence addressed to General de Quesnel, begging\nhim to be present at the meeting next day, the 5th.

Valentine\nthen took the dictionary, and the notary watched her while she turned\nover the pages.\n\nShe passed her finger slowly down the columns, and when she came to the\nword “Will,” M. Noirtier’s eye bade her stop.\n\n“Will,” said the notary; “it is very evident that M. Noirtier is\ndesirous of making his will.”\n\n“Yes, yes, yes,” motioned the invalid.\n\n“Really, sir, you must allow that this is most extraordinary,” said the\nastonished notary, turning to M. de Villefort.\n\n“Yes,” said the procureur, “and I think the will promises to be yet\nmore extraordinary, for I cannot see how it is to be drawn up without\nthe intervention of Valentine, and she may, perhaps, be considered as\ntoo much interested in its contents to allow of her being a suitable\ninterpreter of the obscure and ill-defined wishes of her grandfather.”\n\n“No, no, no,” replied the eye of the paralytic.\n\n“What?” said Villefort, “do you mean to say that Valentine is not\ninterested in your will?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Sir,” said the notary, whose interest had been greatly excited, and\nwho had resolved on publishing far and wide the account of this\nextraordinary and picturesque scene, “what appeared so impossible to me\nan hour ago, has now become quite easy and practicable, and this may be\na perfectly valid will, provided it be read in the presence of seven\nwitnesses, approved by the testator, and sealed by the notary in the\npresence of the witnesses.

As to the\ndetails, the greater part will be furnished afterwards by the state in\nwhich we find the affairs of the testator, and by yourself, who, having\nhad the management of them, can doubtless give full information on the\nsubject. But besides all this, in order that the instrument may not be\ncontested, I am anxious to give it the greatest possible authenticity,\ntherefore, one of my colleagues will help me, and, contrary to custom,\nwill assist in the dictation of the testament. Are you satisfied, sir?”\ncontinued the notary, addressing the old man.\n\n30175m\n\n\n\n“Yes,” looked the invalid, his eye beaming with delight at the ready\ninterpretation of his meaning.\n\n“What is he going to do?” thought Villefort, whose position demanded\nmuch reserve, but who was longing to know what his father’s intentions\nwere. He left the room to give orders for another notary to be sent,\nbut Barrois, who had heard all that passed, had guessed his master’s\nwishes, and had already gone to fetch one. The procureur then told his\nwife to come up. In the course of a quarter of an hour everyone had\nassembled in the chamber of the paralytic; the second notary had also\narrived.\n\nA few words sufficed for a mutual understanding between the two\nofficers of the law.

When he had ended the perusal, he folded the letter and\nresumed his pensive attitude.\n\n“Well?” asked Madame Danglars, with an anxiety easy to be understood.\n\n“Well, madame?” unhesitatingly repeated Debray.\n\n“With what ideas does that letter inspire you?”\n\n“Oh, it is simple enough, madame; it inspires me with the idea that M.\nDanglars has left suspiciously.”\n\n“Certainly; but is this all you have to say to me?”\n\n“I do not understand you,” said Debray with freezing coldness.\n\n“He is gone! Gone, never to return!”\n\n“Oh, madame, do not think that!”\n\n“I tell you he will never return. I know his character; he is\ninflexible in any resolutions formed for his own interests.

Danglars says, you are rich, and perfectly free.

You have only to remain in Paris for about a\nfortnight, telling the world you are abandoned, and relating the\ndetails of this desertion to your best friends, who will soon spread\nthe report. Then you can quit your house, leaving your jewels and\ngiving up your jointure, and everyone’s mouth will be filled with\npraises of your disinterestedness. They will know you are deserted, and\nthink you also poor, for I alone know your real financial position, and\nam quite ready to give up my accounts as an honest partner.”\n\nThe dread with which the pale and motionless baroness listened to this,\nwas equalled by the calm indifference with which Debray had spoken.\n\n“Deserted?” she repeated; “ah, yes, I am, indeed, deserted! You are\nright, sir, and no one can doubt my position.”\n\nThese were the only words that this proud and violently enamoured woman\ncould utter in response to Debray.\n\n50137m\n\n\n\n“But then you are rich,—very rich, indeed,” continued Debray, taking\nout some papers from his pocket-book, which he spread upon the table.\nMadame Danglars did not see them; she was engaged in stilling the\nbeatings of her heart, and restraining the tears which were ready to\ngush forth.

Curiosity\nhad vanquished the desire of preserving his _incognito_, and he was\nrecognized.

We are leaving Paris, and when our journey is paid, we shall\nhave 5,000 francs left.”\n\nThe blood mounted to the temples of Debray, who held a million in his\npocket-book, and unimaginative as he was he could not help reflecting\nthat the same house had contained two women, one of whom, justly\ndishonored, had left it poor with 1,500,000 francs under her cloak,\nwhile the other, unjustly stricken, but sublime in her misfortune, was\nyet rich with a few deniers.

I became alarmed, as any\nprosecution might be attended with serious consequences. I was\ncompelled, at this period, to leave Corsica on an important expedition;\nI reflected for a long time, and with the hope of averting some\nimpending misfortune, I resolved that Benedetto should accompany me.\n\n“I hoped that the active and laborious life of a smuggler, with the\nsevere discipline on board, would have a salutary effect on his\ncharacter, which was now well-nigh, if not quite, corrupt.

He heard me patiently, and when I had finished,\nburst out laughing.\n\n“‘Are you mad, uncle?’ (he called me by this name when he was in good\nhumor); ‘do you think I am going to change the life I lead for your\nmode of existence—my agreeable indolence for the hard and precarious\ntoil you impose on yourself, exposed to the bitter frost at night, and\nthe scorching heat by day, compelled to conceal yourself, and when you\nare perceived, receive a volley of bullets, all to earn a paltry sum?\nWhy, I have as much money as I want; mother Assunta always furnishes me\nwhen I ask for it! You see that I should be a fool to accept your\noffer.’\n\n“The arguments, and his audacity, perfectly stupefied me. Benedetto\nrejoined his associates, and I saw him from a distance point me out to\nthem as a fool.”\n\n“Sweet child,” murmured Monte Cristo.\n\n“Oh, had he been my own son,” replied Bertuccio, “or even my nephew, I\nwould have brought him back to the right road, for the knowledge that\nyou are doing your duty gives you strength, but the idea that I was\nstriking a child whose father I had killed, made it impossible for me\nto punish him.

The boat they\nwere in could not make a long voyage; there was no vessel at anchor\noutside the harbor; he thought, perhaps, they were going to leave him\non some distant point. He was not bound, nor had they made any attempt\nto handcuff him; this seemed a good augury. Besides, had not the\ndeputy, who had been so kind to him, told him that provided he did not\npronounce the dreaded name of Noirtier, he had nothing to apprehend?\nHad not Villefort in his presence destroyed the fatal letter, the only\nproof against him?\n\nHe waited silently, striving to pierce through the darkness.\n\nThey had left the Ile Ratonneau, where the lighthouse stood, on the\nright, and were now opposite the Point des Catalans. It seemed to the\nprisoner that he could distinguish a feminine form on the beach, for it\nwas there Mercédès dwelt. How was it that a presentiment did not warn\nMercédès that her lover was within three hundred yards of her?\n\nOne light alone was visible; and Dantès saw that it came from Mercédès’\nchamber. Mercédès was the only one awake in the whole settlement. A\nloud cry could be heard by her. But pride restrained him and he did not\nutter it. What would his guards think if they heard him shout like a\nmadman?\n\nHe remained silent, his eyes fixed upon the light; the boat went on,\nbut the prisoner thought only of Mercédès. An intervening elevation of\nland hid the light. Dantès turned and perceived that they had got out\nto sea. While he had been absorbed in thought, they had shipped their\noars and hoisted sail; the boat was now moving with the wind.\n\nIn spite of his repugnance to address the guards, Dantès turned to the\nnearest gendarme, and taking his hand,\n\n“Comrade,” said he, “I adjure you, as a Christian and a soldier, to\ntell me where we are going. I am Captain Dantès, a loyal Frenchman,\nthought accused of treason; tell me where you are conducting me, and I\npromise you on my honor I will submit to my fate.”\n\nThe gendarme looked irresolutely at his companion, who returned for\nanswer a sign that said, “I see no great harm in telling him now,” and\nthe gendarme replied:\n\n“You are a native of Marseilles, and a sailor, and yet you do not know\nwhere you are going?”\n\n“On my honor, I have no idea.”\n\n“Have you no idea whatever?”\n\n“None at all.”\n\n“That is impossible.”\n\n“I swear to you it is true. Tell me, I entreat.”\n\n“But my orders.”\n\n“Your orders do not forbid your telling me what I must know in ten\nminutes, in half an hour, or an hour. You see I cannot escape, even if\nI intended.”\n\n“Unless you are blind, or have never been outside the harbor, you must\nknow.”\n\n“I do not.”\n\n“Look round you then.” Dantès rose and looked forward, when he saw rise\nwithin a hundred yards of him the black and frowning rock on which\nstands the Château d’If. This gloomy fortress, which has for more than\nthree hundred years furnished food for so many wild legends, seemed to\nDantès like a scaffold to a malefactor.\n\n“The Château d’If?” cried he, “what are we going there for?”\n\nThe gendarme smiled.\n\n“I am not going there to be imprisoned,” said Dantès; “it is only used\nfor political prisoners. I have committed no crime. Are there any\nmagistrates or judges at the Château d’If?”\n\n“There are only,” said the gendarme, “a governor, a garrison, turnkeys,\nand good thick walls. Come, come, do not look so astonished, or you\nwill make me think you are laughing at me in return for my good\nnature.”\n\nDantès pressed the gendarme’s hand as though he would crush it.\n\n“You think, then,” said he, “that I am taken to the Château d’If to be\nimprisoned there?”\n\n“It is probable; but there is no occasion to squeeze so hard.”\n\n“Without any inquiry, without any formality?”\n\n“All the formalit"}, {"chunk_id": 202, "text": "ons, Vampa saw himself the captain of a vessel, general of an\narmy, or governor of a province. Teresa saw herself rich, superbly\nattired, and attended by a train of liveried domestics. Then, when they\nhad thus passed the day in building castles in the air, they separated\ntheir flocks, and descended from the elevation of their dreams to the\nreality of their humble position.\n\n“One day the young shepherd told the count’s steward that he had seen a\nwolf come out of the Sabine mountains, and prowl around his flock. The\nsteward gave him a gun; this was what Vampa longed for. This gun had an\nexcellent barrel, made at Brescia, and carrying a ball with the\nprecision of an English rifle; but one day the count broke the stock,\nand had then cast the gun aside. This, however, was nothing to a\nsculptor like Vampa; he examined the broken stock, calculated what\nchange it would require to adapt the gun to his shoulder, and made a\nfresh stock, so beautifully carved that it would have fetched fifteen\nor twenty piastres, had he chosen to sell it. But nothing could be\nfarther from his thoughts.\n\n“For a long time a gun had been the young man’s greatest ambition. In\nevery country where independence has taken the place of liberty, the\nfirst desire of a manly heart is to possess a weapon, which at once\nrenders him capable of defence or attack, and, by rendering its owner\nterrible, often makes him feared. From this moment Vampa devoted all\nhis leisure time to perfecting himself in the use of his precious\nweapon; he purchased powder and ball, and everything served him for a\nmark—the trunk of some old and moss-grown olive-tree, that grew on the\nSabine mountains; the fox, as he quitted his earth on some marauding\nexcursion; the eagle that soared above their heads: and thus he soon\nbecame so expert, that Teresa overcame the terror she at first felt at\nthe report, and amused herself by watching him direct the ball wherever\nhe pleased, with as much accuracy as if he placed it by hand.\n\n20107m\n\n\n\n“One evening a wolf emerged from a pine-wood near which they were\nusually stationed, but the wolf had scarcely advanced ten yards ere he\nwas dead. Proud of this exploit, Vampa took the dead animal on his\nshoulders, and carried him to the farm. These exploits had gained Luigi\nconsiderable reputation. The man of superior abilities always finds\nadmirers, go where he will. He was spoken of as the most adroit, the\nstrongest, and the most courageous _contadino_ for ten leagues around;\nand although Teresa was universally allowed to be the most beautiful\ngirl of the Sabines, no one had ever spoken to her of love, because it\nwas known that she was beloved by Vampa. And yet the two young people\nhad never declared their affection; they had grown together like two\ntrees whose roots are mingled, whose branches intertwined, and whose\nintermingled perfume rises to the heavens. Only their wish to see each\nother had become a necessity, and they would have preferred death to a\nday’s separation.\n\n“Teresa was sixteen, and Vampa seventeen. About this time, a band of\nbrigands that had established itself in the Lepini mountains began to\nbe much spoken of. The brigands have never been really extirpated from\nthe neighborhood of Rome. Sometimes a chief is wanted, but when a chief\npresents himself he rarely has to wait long for a band of followers.\n\n“The celebrated Cucumetto, pursued in the Abruzzo, driven out of the\nkingdom of Naples, where he had carried on a regular war, had crossed\nthe Garigliano, like Manfred, and had taken refuge on the banks of the\nAmasine between Sonnino and Juperno.

It was a\npaper signed by the owners of the Britannia and Captain Grant, whose\nwriting Mary recognized immediately. It stated that \"Tom Ayrton, able\nseaman, was engaged as quartermaster on board the brig Britannia of\nGlasgow.\" There was, therefore, no possible doubt of Ayrton's identity,\nfor it would have been difficult to suppose that this contract could be\nin his hands and not belong to him.\n\n[Sidenote: ENTANGLEMENTS.]\n\n\"Now,\" said Glenarvan, \"I appeal to you all for advice as to what is\nbest to be done.

But ought we to suppose that,\nlike you, they have been carried to the north?\"\n\n\"It is quite likely, sir,\" replied Ayrton. \"The hostile tribes would\nhardly remain in the neighborhood of the English provinces.\"\n\n\"This fact will complicate our search,\" said Glenarvan, quite\ndisconcerted. \"How shall we find the traces of the prisoners in the\ninterior of so vast a continent?\"\n\nA prolonged silence followed this remark. Lady Helena frequently\ncast a questioning glance at her companions, but without eliciting a\nresponsive sign. Paganel himself was silent, contrary to his custom.\nHis usual ingenuity now failed him.

During the period of a year Harry Grant landed\nat the principal ports of Oceanica, opposing unjustifiable captures,\nand often a victim to the hostility of unjust traders. He found,\nhowever, an important point on the western coast of Papua. Here the\nestablishment of a Scottish colony appeared to him feasible, and its\nprosperity assured. After examining Papua, the Britannia sailed to\nCallao for provisions, and left that port on the 30th of May, 1862, to\nreturn to Europe by the way of the Indian Ocean and the Cape. Three\nweeks after her departure, a terrible tempest disabled her. It became\nnecessary to cut away the masts. A leak was discovered in the hold,\nwhich they did not succeed in stopping. The crew were soon overtasked\nand exhausted. The pumps could not be worked. For eight days the\nvessel was at the mercy of the storm. There were six feet of water\nin her hold, and she gradually foundered. The boats had been washed\noverboard, and the crew had given themselves up for lost, when on the\nnight of June 22nd, as Paganel had rightly interpreted, they descried\nthe eastern coast of Australia. The vessel soon stranded. A violent\nshock was felt. At this moment Ayrton, borne by a wave, was cast into\nthe midst of the breakers, and lost all consciousness. When he came to\nhimself, he was in the hands of the natives, who carried him into the\ninterior of the country. Since then he had heard nothing more of the\nBritannia, and naturally supposed that she had been wrecked, with all\non board, on the dangerous reefs of Twofold Bay.\n\nThis was Ayrton's story, which elicited more than once exclamations of\nsympathy. The major could not justly doubt its correctness; and after\nthis recital the quartermaster's own experiences possessed a more real\ninterest. Indeed, thanks to the document, they no longer doubted that\nCaptain Grant had survived the shipwreck with two of his sailors. From\nthe fate of the one they could fairly conjecture that of the other.\n\nAyrton was invited to tell of his own adventures, which was soon and\nsimply done. The shipwrecked sailor, prisoner of a native tribe, was\ncarried into the interior regions watered by the Darling. Here he led\na very wretched existence, because the tribe itself was miserable; but\nhe was not maltreated. For two long years he endured a painful slavery.\nHowever, the hope of regaining his liberty sustained his courage. He\nwatched for the least opportunity of escaping, although his flight\nwould plunge him into the midst of innumerable perils. One night\nin October he eluded the vigilance of the natives, and took refuge\nin the depths of extensive forests. For a month, living on roots,\nedible ferns, and the gum of the mimosa, often overcome by despair,\nhe wandered in those vast solitudes, with the sun as his guide by\nday and the stars by night. In this way he crossed marshes, rivers,\nmountains, in short, all that uninhabited portion of country that few\ntravelers have explored. At last, exhausted and almost dead, he reached\nthe hospitable dwelling of Mr. O'Moore, where his labor insured him a\ncomfortable livelihood.\n\n\"And if Ayrton is pleased with me,\" said the Irish colonist, when the\nstory was finished, \"I cannot but be pleased with him. He is an honest\nand intelligent man, a good worker, and, if he chooses, this house\nshall long be at his service.\"\n\nAyrton thanked Mr. O'Moore, and waited for further questions. He\nprobably thought, however, that the legitimate curiosity of his hearers\nought to be satisfied. W"}, {"chunk_id": 222, "text": "on, and\nstill I do not hesitate to tell you that I know little concerning Harry\nGrant.\"\n\n\"Little!\" cried Glenarvan.\n\n\"Yes, my lord; the circumstances that I am able to communicate to\nyou are relative to myself. They are personal experiences, and will\nscarcely tend to put you on the track you have lost.\"\n\n[Sidenote: REVELATIONS AND DISCLOSURES.]\n\nA keen disappointment was manifest on the features of Glenarvan and\nthe major. They had believed the quartermaster to possess an important\nsecret, and yet he now confessed that his disclosures would be almost\nuseless.\n\nHowever that may be, this avowal of Ayrton, who surrendered himself\nwithout security, singularly affected his hearers, especially when he\nadded, in conclusion:\n\n\"Thus you are forewarned, my lord, that the business will be less\nadvantageous for you than for me.\"\n\n\"No matter,\" replied Glenarvan; \"I accept your proposal, Ayrton. You\nhave my word that you shall be landed at one of the islands of the\nPacific.\"\n\n\"Very well, my lord,\" said he.\n\nWas this strange man pleased with this decision? You might have doubted\nit, for his impassive countenance betrayed no emotion. He seemed as if\nacting for another more than for himself.\n\n\"I am ready to answer,\" continued he.\n\n\"We have no questions to ask you,\" rejoined Glenarvan. \"Tell us what\nyou know, Ayrton, and, in the first place, who you are.\"\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" replied he, \"I am really Tom Ayrton, quartermaster of the\nBritannia. I left Glasgow in Captain Grant's ship on the 12th of March,\n1861. For fourteen months we traversed together the Pacific, seeking\nsome favorable place to found a Scottish colony. Harry Grant was a man\ncapable of performing great deeds, but frequently serious disputes\narose between us. His character did not harmonize with mine. I could\nnot yield; but with Harry Grant, when his resolution is taken, all\nresistance is impossible. He is like iron towards himself and others.\nHowever, I dared to mutiny, and attempted to involve the crew and gain\npossession of the vessel. Whether I did right or wrong is of little\nimportance. However it may be, Captain Grant did not hesitate to land\nme, April 8, 1862, on the west coast of Australia.\"\n\n\"Australia!\" exclaimed the major, interrupting Ayrton's story. \"Then\nyou left the Britannia before her arrival at Callao, where the last\nnews of her was dated?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the quartermaster; \"for the Britannia never stopped at\nCallao while I was on board. If I spoke of Callao at O'Moore's farm, it\nwas your story that gave me this information.\"\n\n\"Go on, Ayrton,\" said Glenarvan.\n\n[Sidenote: MORE BLANKS THAN PRIZES.]\n\n\"I found myself, therefore, abandoned on an almost desert coast, but\nonly twenty miles from the penitentiary of Perth, the capital of\nWestern Australia. Wandering along the shore, I met a band of convicts\nwho had just escaped. I joined them. You will spare me, my lord, the\naccount of my life for two years and a half. It is enough to know that\nI became chief of the runaways, under the name of Ben Joyce. In the\nmonth of September, 1864, I made my appearance at the Irishman's farm,\nand was received as a servant under my true name of Ayrton. Here I\nwaited till an opportunity should be offered to gain possession of a\nvessel. This was my great object. Two months later the Duncan arrived.\nDuring your visit at the farm you related, my lord, the whole story of\nCaptain Grant. I then learned what I had not known, the Britannia's\nstoppage at Callao, the last news of her, dated June, 1862, two months\nafter my abandonment, the finding of the document, the shipwreck of the\nvessel, and finally the important reasons you had for seeking Captain\nGrant in Australia. I did not hesitate, but resolved to appropriate\nthe Duncan,--a marvelous ship, that would have distanced the best of\nthe British navy. However, there were serious injuries to be repaired.\nI therefore let her start for Melbourne, and offered myself to you in\nmy real character of quartermaster, volunteering to guide you to the\nscene o"}, {"chunk_id": 152, "text": " the horses are dead.\"\n\n\"The poison is not far away.\"\n\n\"There is enough here to settle an entire troop of cavalry.

'A cunning\nman, this Ben Joyce,' said the farrier; 'a famous quartermaster, with\nhis invented shipwreck. If his plan succeeds, it will be a stroke of\nfortune. Devilish Ayrton! Call him Ben Joyce, for he has well earned\nhis name.' These rascals then left the wood of gum-trees. I knew what\nI wished, and returned to the encampment with the certainty that all\nthe convicts in Australia are not reformed, in spite of Paganel's\narguments.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Glenarvan, whose face was pale with anger, \"Ayrton has\nbrought us here to rob and assassinate us?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the major.\n\n\"And, since leaving the Wimerra, his band has followed and watched us,\nwaiting for a favorable opportunity?\"\n\n[Sidenote: FROM DEPTH TO DEPTH.]\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"But this wretch is not, then, a sailor of the Britannia? He has stolen\nhis name and contract?\"\n\nAll eyes were turned towards MacNabb, who must have considered this\nmatter.\n\n\"These,\" replied he, in his calm voice, \"are the proofs that can be\nderived from this obscure state of affairs. In my opinion this man's\nreal name is Ayrton. Ben Joyce is his fighting title. It is certain\nthat he knows Harry Grant, and has been quartermaster on board the\nBritannia. These facts, proved already by the precise details given\nby Ayrton, are still further corroborated by the conversation of the\nconvicts that I have related. Let us not, therefore, be led astray\nby vain conjectures, but only be certain that Ayrton is Ben Joyce, a\nsailor of the Britannia, now chief of a band of convicts.\"\n\nThe major's explanation was accepted as conclusive.\n\n\"Now,\" replied Glenarvan, \"will you tell me how and why Harry Grant's\nquartermaster is in Australia?\"\n\n\"How, I do not know,\" said MacNabb; \"and the police declare they know\nno more than I on the subject. Why, it is also impossible for me to\nsay. Here is a mystery that the future will explain.\"\n\n\"The police do not even know the identity of Ayrton and Ben Joyce,\"\nsaid Captain Mangles.\n\n\"You are right, John,\" replied the major; \"and such information would\nbe likely to facilitate their search.\"\n\n\"This unfortunate, then,\" remarked Lady Helena, \"intruded into\nO'Moore's farm with a criminal intention?\"\n\n\"There is no doubt of it,\" continued MacNabb. \"He was meditating\nsome hostile attack upon the Irishman, when a better opportunity was\noffered. Chance threw us in his way. He heard Glenarvan's story of the\nshipwreck, and, like a bold man, he promptly decided to take part in\nthe expedition. At the Wimerra he communicated with one of his friends,\nthe farrier of Black Point, and thus left distinguishable traces of\nour course. His band followed us. A poisonous plant enabled him to\ngradually kill our oxen and horses. Then, at the proper moment, he\nentangled us in the marshes of the Snowy, and surrendered us to the\nconvicts he commanded.\"\n\nEverything possible had been said concerning Ben Joyce. His past had\njust been reviewed by the major, and the wretch appeared as he was,--a\nbold and formidable criminal. His intentions had been clearly proved,\nand required, on the part of Glenarvan, extreme vigilance. Fortunately,\nthere was less to fear from the detected bandit than the secret traitor.\n\nBut one serious fact appeared from this explanation. No one had yet\nthought of it; only Mary Grant, disregarding the past, looked forward\nto the future. Captain Mangles first saw her pale and disconsolate. He\nunderstood what was passing in her mind.\n\n\"Miss Mary!\" cried he, \"you are weeping!\"\n\n\"What is the matter, my child?\" asked Lady Helena.\n\n\"My father, madam, my father!\" replied the young girl.\n\nShe could not continue. But a sudden revelation dawned on the mind of\neach. They comprehended Mary's grief, why the tears flowed from her\neyes, why the "}, {"chunk_id": 115, "text": "rough the forests, and to the eastern coast, there was another chance\nof success. Glenarvan felt the importance of this arrangement, and was\ntherefore particularly desirous of obtaining the services of Captain\nGrant's companion. He inquired of his host whether he was willing for\nhim to propose to Ayrton to accompany them. Mr. O'Moore consented,\nthough not without regret at losing so good an assistant.\n\n\"Well, Ayrton, will you aid us in our search for the sailors of the\nBritannia?\"\n\nThe quartermaster did not answer immediately; he seemed to hesitate for\na few moments, but finally, after reflecting, said:\n\n\"Yes, my lord, I will follow you; and, if I do not set you upon the\ntrack of Captain Grant, I will at least guide you to the place where\nhis vessel was wrecked.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" replied Glenarvan.\n\n\"One question, my lord.\"\n\n\"Ask it.\"\n\n\"Where will you join the Duncan?\"\n\n\"At Melbourne, if we do not cross Australia; on the eastern coast, if\nour search is continued so far.\"\n\n\"But the captain of the Duncan?\"\n\n\"He will await my orders at Melbourne.\"\n\n\"Very well, my lord,\" said Ayrton; \"rely on me.\"\n\n\"I will,\" replied Glenarvan.\n\nThe quartermaster was heartily thanked by the travelers. Captain\nGrant's children lavished upon him their most grateful caresses. All\nwere delighted at his decision, except the colonist, who would lose\nin him an intelligent and faithful assistant. But he understood the\nimportance that Glenarvan attached to this new addition to his force,\nand was resigned. He had, moreover, engaged to furnish them with the\nmeans of conveyance for the journey, and, this business being settled,\nthe party returned on board.\n\n[Illustration: This business being settled, the party returned on\nboard.]\n\nEverything was now changed; all hesitation had vanished. These\ncourageous searchers were no longer to wander on blindly. Harry Grant,\nthey believed, had found a refuge on the continent, and each heart\nwas full of the satisfaction that certainty brings when it takes the\nplace of doubt. In two months, perhaps, the Duncan would land the lost\ncaptain on the shores of Scotland.\n\nWhen Captain Mangles seconded the proposal that they should attempt to\ncross Australia with the ladies, he supposed that this time he would\naccompany the expedition. He therefore consulted Glenarvan on the\nsubject, and brought forward various arguments in his own favor, such\nas his desire to take part in the search for his countryman, and his\nusefulness in the undertaking.\n\n\"One question, John,\" said Glenarvan. \"You have absolute confidence in\nyour mate?\"\n\n\"Absolute,\" replied he. \"Tom Austin is a good sailor. He will take the\nDuncan to Melbourne, repair her thoroughly, and bring her back at the\nappointed time. He is a man devoted to duty and discipline, and will\nnever take the responsibility of changing or delaying the execution of\nan order. You can rely upon him as fully as on myself.\"\n\n\"Very well, captain,\" replied Glenarvan; \"you shall accompany us; for,\"\nadded he, smiling, \"you certainly ought to be present when we find Mary\nGrant's father.\"\n\n\"Ah, my lord!\" murmured Captain Mangles, with something like a blush\nupon his swarthy cheeks.\n\n[Sidenote: A PALACE-CART.]\n\nThe next day the captain, accompanied by the carpenter and by the\nsailors loaded with provisions, returned to the farm of Mr. O'Moore,\nwho was to assist him in the preparations. All the family were waiting\nfor him, ready to work under his orders. Ayrton was there, and freely\ngave them the benefit of his experience. He and his employer were\nagreed on this point, that the ladies ought to make the journey in an\nox-cart, and the gentlemen on horseback. The colonist could procure\nthem the animals and vehicle.\n\nThe vehicle was a cart twenty feet long and covered with an awning,\nthe whole resting upon four wheels, without spokes, felloes, or tires.\nThe front wheels were a long way from the hind ones, and were joined\ntogether by a rude contrivance that made it impossible to turn short.\nTo the body of the cart was a"}]}

He\nprobably thought, however, that the legitimate curiosity of his hearers\nought to be satisfied. What could he say that had not been repeated\na hundred times already? Glenarvan was, therefore, about to open the\nconversation on a new topic, to profit by the information received from\nAyrton, when the major, addressing him, said:\n\n\"You were quartermaster of the Britannia?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Ayrton.\n\nBut perceiving that a certain feeling of distrust, a doubt, however\nslight, had suggested this inquiry, he added,--\n\n\"I saved my contract from the wreck.\"\n\nHe immediately left the room in search of this authoritative document.\nDuring his absence, which lasted but a few moments, Mr. O'Moore said:\n\n\"My lord, I will answer for it that Ayrton is an honest man. During the\ntwo months that he has been in my employ, I have had no fault to find\nwith him. I knew the story of his shipwreck and captivity. He is a true\nman, and worthy of your entire confidence.\"\n\nGlenarvan was about to answer that he had never doubted Ayrton's\nhonesty, when the latter returned and presented his contract. It was a\npaper signed by the owners of the Britannia and Captain Grant, whose\nwriting Mary recognized immediately. It stated that \"Tom Ayrton, able\nseaman, was engaged as quartermaster on board the brig Britannia of\nGlasgow.\" There was, therefore, no possible doubt of Ayrton's identity,\nfor it would have been difficult to suppose that this contract could be\nin his hands and not belong to him.\n\n[Sidenote: ENTANGLEMENTS.]\n\n\"Now,\" said Glenarvan, \"I appeal to you all for advice as to what is\nbest to be done. Your advice, Ayrton, would be particularly valuable,\nand I should be much obliged if you would give it to us.\"\n\nThe sailor reflected a few moments, and then replied:\n\n\"I thank you, my lord, for the confidence you place in me, and hope to\nshow myself worthy of it. I have some knowledge of the country, and of\nthe customs of the natives; and, if I can be of use to you----\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" replied Glenarvan.\n\n\"I think, like you,\" continued Ayrton, \"that Captain Grant and his two\nsailors were saved from the shipwreck; but, since they have not reached\nthe English possessions, since they have not reappeared, I doubt not\nthat their fate was the same as my own, and that they are prisoners of\nthe natives.\"\n\n\"You repeat, Mr. Ayrton, the arguments that I have already\nsubstantiated,\" said Paganel. \"The shipwrecked seamen are evidently\nprisoners of the natives, as they feared. But ought we to suppose that,\nlike you, they have been carried to the north?\"\n\n\"It is quite likely, sir,\" replied Ayrton. \"The hostile tribes would\nhardly remain in the neighborhood of the English provinces.\"\n\n\"This fact will complicate our search,\" said Glenarvan, quite\ndisconcerted. \"How shall we find the traces of the prisoners in the\ninterior of so vast a continent?\"\n\nA prolonged silence followed this remark. Lady Helena frequently\ncast a questioning glance at her companions, but without eliciting a\nresponsive sign. Paganel himself was silent, contrary to his custom.\nHis usual ingenuity now failed him. Captain Mangles paced the room with\nlong strides, as if he had been on the deck of his vessel, involved in\nsome difficulty.\n\n\"And you, Mr. Ayrton,\" said Lady Helena, at length, to the\nquartermaster, \"what would you do?\"\n\n\"Madam,\" replied he, promptly, \"I should re-embark on board the Duncan,\nand go straight to the place of the shipwreck. There I should act\naccording to circumstances, or indications that chance might furnish.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" said Glenarvan; \"but we must wait till the Duncan is\nrepaired.\"\n\n\"Ah! you"}, {"chunk_id": 150, "text": "on a good\nfooting with your mate, and in six days I engage to bring the Duncan to\nTwofold Bay.\"\n\n\"Well said!\" replied Glenarvan. \"You are a brave and intelligent man,\nAyrton, and will succeed.\"\n\nThe quartermaster was evidently more capable than any one else of\nfulfilling this difficult mission. Captain Mangles raised one final\nobjection, that Ayrton's presence was necessary to enable them to\nfind traces of the Brittania or Captain Grant; but the major observed\nthat they should remain encamped on the banks of the Snowy till the\nmessenger's return, that it was not proposed to resume the search\nwithout him, and that consequently his absence could be in no way\nprejudicial to their interests.\n\n\"Well then, Ayrton, start,\" said Glenarvan. \"Make haste, and return to\nthe encampment by way of Eden.\"\n\nA gleam of satisfaction seemed to light up the eyes of the\nquartermaster. He turned his head to one side, though not so quickly\nbut that Captain Mangles had intercepted his glance, and instinctively\nfelt his suspicions increased.\n\nThe quartermaster made his preparations for departure, aided by the\ntwo sailors, one of whom attended to his horse, and the other to his\nprovisions. Meantime Glenarvan wrote the letter designed for Tom Austin.\n\nHe ordered the mate of the Duncan to repair without delay to Twofold\nBay, and recommended the quartermaster to him as a man in whom he could\nplace entire confidence. As soon as he arrived at the bay, he was to\nsend a detachment of sailors under the command of Ayrton.\n\nHe had just reached this part of his letter, when the major, who had\nbeen looking over his shoulder, asked him, in a singular tone, how he\nwrote the word Ayrton.\n\n\"As it is pronounced,\" replied Glenarvan.\n\n\"That is a mistake,\" said the major coolly. \"It is pronounced Ayrton,\nbut it is written 'Ben Joyce'!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLI.\n\nTHE PLOT UNVEILED.\n\n\nThe sound of the name of Ben Joyce fell upon the party like a\nthunderbolt. Ayrton suddenly sprang to his feet. In his hand was a\nrevolver. A report was heard; and Glenarvan fell, struck by a bullet.\n\nBefore Captain Mangles and the sailors recovered from the surprise into\nwhich this unexpected turn of affairs had thrown them, the audacious\nconvict had escaped, and joined his band, scattered along the edge of\nthe wood of gum-trees.\n\n[Illustration: A report was heard; and Glenarvan fell, struck by a\nbullet.]\n\nThe tent did not offer a sufficient shelter against the bullets, and\nit was clearly necessary to beat a retreat. Glenarvan, who was but\nslightly injured, had risen.\n\n\"To the cart! to the cart!\" cried Captain Mangles, as he hurried on\nLady Helena and Mary Grant, who were soon in safety behind its stout\nsides.\n\nThe captain, the major, Paganel, and the sailors then seized their\nrifles, and stood ready to repel the convicts. Glenarvan and Robert had\njoined the ladies, while Olbinett hastened to the common defence.\n\nThese events had transpired with the rapidity of lightning. Captain\nMangles attentively watched the edge of the wood; but the reports\nsuddenly ceased on the arrival of Ben Joyce, and a profound silence\nsucceeded the noisy fusillade. A few wreaths of white smoke were still\ncurling up between the branches of the gum-trees, but the tall tufts of\ngastrolobium were motionless and all signs of attack had disappeared.\n\nThe major and Captain Mangles extended their examinations as far as the\ngreat trees. The place was abandoned. Numerous footprints were seen,\nand a few half-burnt cartridges smoked on the ground. The major, like\na prudent man, extinguished them, for a spark was enough to kindle a\nformidable conflagration in this forest of dry trees.\n\n\"The convicts have disappeared,\" said Captain Mangles.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the major; \"and this disappearance alarms me. I should\nprefer to meet them face to face. It is better to encounter a tiger in\nthe open plain than a serpent in the grass. Let us search these bushes\naround the cart.\"\n\n[Sidenote: UNRAVELINGS.]\n\nThe major and captain scoured the surrounding c"}, {"chunk_id": 16, "text": "lk straight.\"\n\n\"Be easy, my boy,\" replied Glenarvan, without adding that the use of\nthe \"cat-o'-nine-tails\" was prohibited, and moreover quite needless, on\nboard the Duncan.\n\n[Sidenote: GLASGOW GOSSIP.]\n\nTo complete the roll of the passengers, it will be sufficient to\ndescribe Major MacNabb. The major was a man of fifty, of calm,\nregular features, who did as he was bid; of an excellent and superior\ncharacter, modest, taciturn, peaceable, and mild; always agreeing\nwith anything or any one, disputing nothing, and neither contradicting\nhimself nor exaggerating. He would mount with measured step the\nstaircase to his bed-chamber, even were a cannon-ball behind him; and\nprobably to his dying day would never find an opportunity to fly into a\npassion.\n\nThis man possessed, in a high degree, not only the common courage of\nthe battle-field (that physical bravery due only to nervous strength),\nbut, better still, moral courage, that is to say, firmness of soul. If\nhe had a fault, it was that of being absolutely Scotch from head to\nfoot, a pure-blooded Caledonian, an infatuated observer of the ancient\ncustoms of his country. Through his relationship to the Glenarvans he\nlived at Malcolm Castle; and as major and military man it was very\nnatural that he should be found on board the Duncan.\n\nSuch, then, were the passengers of this yacht, summoned by unforeseen\ncircumstances to accomplish one of the most surprising voyages of\nmodern times. Since her arrival at the wharf at Glasgow, she had\nmonopolized the public attention. A considerable number came every day\nto visit her. They were interested in her alone, and spoke only of her,\nto the great umbrage of the other captains of the port, among others\nCaptain Burton, commanding the Scotia, a magnificent steamer, moored\nbeside the Duncan, and bound for Calcutta. The Scotia, from her size,\nhad a right to consider the Duncan as a mere fly-boat. Nevertheless,\nall the attraction centred in Lord Glenarvan's yacht, and increased\nfrom day to day.\n\nThe time of departure approached. Captain Mangles had shown himself\nskillful and expeditious. A month after her trial trip in the Frith of\nClyde, the Duncan, laden, provisioned, and equipped, was ready to put\nto sea. The 25th of August was appointed for the time of departure,\nwhich would enable the yacht to reach the southern latitudes by the\nbeginning of spring. Lord Glenarvan, when his plan was matured, did\nnot neglect to make investigations into the hardships and perils of the\nvoyage; yet he did not hesitate on this account, but prepared to leave\nMalcolm Castle.\n\nOn the 24th of August, Lord and Lady Glenarvan, Major MacNabb, Mary and\nRobert Grant, Mr. Olbinett, the steward of the yacht, and his wife, who\nwas in the service of Lady Glenarvan, left the castle, after taking an\naffectionate farewell of their family servants. Several hours afterward\nthey found themselves on board. Many of the population of Glasgow\nwelcomed with sympathetic admiration the young and courageous lady who\nrenounced the pleasures of a life of luxury, and sailed to the rescue\nof the shipwrecked sailors.\n\nThe apartments of Lord Glenarvan and his wife occupied the entire stern\nof the vessel. They consisted of two bed-chambers, a parlor, and two\ndressing-rooms, adjoining which was an open square inclosed by six\ncabins, five of which were occupied by Mary and Robert Grant, Mr. and\nMrs. Olbinett, and Major MacNabb. As for the cabins of the captain and\nthe mate, they were situated in the forecastle, and opened on the deck.\nThe crew were lodged between-decks very comfortably, for the yacht of\ncourse carried nothing but her coal, provisions, and armament.\n\nThe Duncan was to start on the night of the 24th, as the tide fell at\nthree o'clock in the morning. But first those who were present were\nwitness to a touching scene. At eight in the evening Lord Glenarvan and\nhis companions, the entire crew, from the firemen to the captain, all\nwho were to take part in this voyage of sacrifice, left the yacht,"}, {"chunk_id": 124, "text": "IRED.]\n\nIt was not without a certain feeling of apprehension that the major\nhad seen Ayrton leave the Wimerra to procure a farrier at Black Point\nStation. However, he did not breathe a word of his personal suspicions,\nbut contented himself with exploring the surroundings of the river,\nwhose tranquillity was undisturbed. As for Glenarvan, his only fear was\nto see Ayrton return alone. In the absence of skilled labor, the cart\ncould not resume its journey, which would be interrupted for several\ndays perhaps; and his longings for success and eagerness to attain his\nend admitted of no delay.\n\nFortunately, Ayrton had lost neither his time nor his trouble. The\nnext morning he reappeared at break of day. A man accompanied him, by\nprofession a farrier. He was a tall, stout fellow, but of a low and\nbrutish appearance, which did not prepossess one in his favor. However,\nthis was of little importance, if he knew his business. At all events\nhis breath was not wasted in idle words.\n\n\"Is he an efficient workman?\" inquired Captain Mangles of the\nquartermaster.\n\n\"I know no more than you, captain,\" replied Ayrton. \"We shall see.\"\n\nThe farrier began his work. He was a man who understood his trade, as\none could see by the way in which he repaired the wheels of the cart.\nHe labored skillfully and with uncommon energy.\n\nDuring the operation, the major noticed that the farrier's wrists were\nconsiderably eroded, and that they were each encircled by a blackish\nring of extravasated blood. These were the marks of recent wounds,\nwhich the sleeves of a miserable woolen shirt but partially concealed.\nMacNabb questioned the man about these erosions, which must have been\nvery painful. He, however, made no reply, but stolidly kept on at his\nwork.\n\nTwo hours after, the injuries of the cart were repaired. As for\nGlenarvan's horse, he was quickly shod. The farrier had taken care to\nbring shoes all prepared. There was a peculiarity about them, however,\nwhich did not escape the major. It was a trefoil rudely carved on the\nouter rim. He pointed it out to Ayrton.\n\n\"It is the Black Point mark,\" replied the quartermaster, \"which enables\nthem to follow the tracks of the horses that stray from the station,\nand not confound them with others.\"\n\nThe farrier, having done all that was required of him, now claimed his\nwages, and departed without having spoken four words.\n\nHalf an hour later, the travelers were on the move. Beyond the curtain\nof mimosas extended a broad, uncovered space, which justly deserved its\nname of \"open plain.\" Fragments of quartz and ferruginous rocks lay\namong the bushes, tall grass, and hedgerows that protected numerous\nflocks. Several miles farther on, the wheels of the cart sank deeply\nin the marshy lowlands, through which ran winding creeks, half hidden\nbeneath a canopy of gigantic rushes. The journey, notwithstanding, was\nneither difficult nor tedious.\n\nLady Helena invited the horsemen to call upon her in turn, for her\nparlor was very small. Each was thus relieved from the fatigue of\nhorseback riding, and enjoyed the society of this amiable lady,\nwho, assisted by Miss Mary, performed with perfect grace the honors\nof her movable mansion. Captain Mangles was not forgotten in these\ninvitations, and his rather sober conversation was not at all\ndispleasing.\n\nAt eleven o'clock they arrived at Carlsbrook, quite an important\nmunicipality. Ayrton thought it best to pass by the city without\nentering. Glenarvan was of the same opinion; but Paganel, always\neager for something new, desired to visit the place. Accordingly,\nthe geographer, taking Robert with him as usual, started on his\nexplorations, while the cart slowly continued its journey. Their\ninspection of the town was very rapid, and shortly afterwards they had\njoined their companions.\n\nWhile they were passing through this region, the travelers requested\nPaganel to give them some account of its progress, and the geographer,\nin compliance with their wishes, had just begun a lecture upon the\ncivilization"}]}

He looked at his watch; it was two o'clock.\n\nHowever, having no certain knowledge of immediate danger, he did not\nwake his companions, whom fatigue held in a deep repose, but fell\nhimself into a heavy sleep that lasted several hours.\n\nAll at once a violent crash startled him to his feet. It was a\ndeafening roar, like the irregular noise of innumerable artillery\nwagons rolling over a hollow pavement. Glenarvan suddenly felt the\nearth tremble beneath his feet. He saw the hut sway and start open.\n\n\"Look out!\" he cried.\n\nHis companions, awakened and thrown into confusion, were hurried down\na rapid descent. The day was breaking, and the scene was terrible. The\nform of the mountains suddenly changed, their tops were truncated,\nthe tottering peaks disappeared, as if a pitfall had opened at their\nbase. A mass, several miles in extent, became detached entire, and slid\ntowards the plain.\n\n\"An earthquake!\" cried Paganel.\n\nHe was not mistaken. It was one of those phenomena frequent on the\nmountain frontier of Chili. This portion of the globe is disturbed\nby subterranean fires, and the volcanoes of this chain afford only\ninsufficient outlets for the confined vapors.\n\nIn the meantime the plateau, to which seven stunned and terrified men\nclung by the tufts of moss, glided with the rapidity of an express.\nNot a cry was possible, not a movement of escape. They could not hear\neach other. The internal rumblings, the din of the avalanche, the crash\nof the blocks of granite, and the whirlwinds of snow, rendered all\ncommunication with each other impossible.\n\n[Sidenote: A STEEP GRADIENT.]\n\nAt one time the mass would slide without jolts or jars; at another,\nseized with a pitching and rolling motion like the deck of a vessel\nshaken by the billows, it would run along the edge of the abysses\ninto which the fragments of the mountain fell, uproot the trees of\ncenturies, and level with the precision of an enormous scythe all the\ninequalities of the eastern slope.\n\nHow long this indescribable scene lasted, no one could tell; in what\nabyss all were to be engulfed, no one was able to foresee. Whether they\nwere all there alive, or whether one of them was lying at the bottom of\na crevasse, no one could say. Stunned by the swiftness of the descent,\nchilled by the keenness of the cold, blinded by the whirlwinds of snow,\nthey panted, exhausted and almost inanimate, and only clung to the\nrocks by the supreme instinct of preservation.\n\nAll at once a shock of unusual violence arrested their gliding vehicle.\nThey were thrown forward and rolled upon the last declivities of the\nmountains. The plateau had stopped short.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nFor a few moments no one stirred. At last one rose, deafened by the\nshock, but yet firm. It was the major.

To mistake the railroad was not so bad; to take\nthe train to Dumbarton, instead of Edinburgh, would do. But to mistake\nthe vessel, and be sailing to Chili, when he wished to go to India, was\nthe height of absent-mindedness.\n\n[Sidenote: ABSENT-MINDEDNESS.]\n\n\"On the whole, I am not astonished at this on the part of Jacques\nPaganel,\" said Glenarvan; \"he is noted for such blunders. He once\npublished a celebrated map of America, in which he located Japan.\nHowever, he is a distinguished scholar, and one of the best geographers\nof France.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"But what are we going to do with the poor gentleman?\" asked Lady\nHelena. \"We cannot take him to Patagonia.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" replied MacNabb gravely. \"We are not responsible for his\nerrors.

He kept repeating\nthose fatal words: \"The Duncan! the Duncan!\" He could find no others\nin his vocabulary. He went to and fro, examining the rigging of the\nyacht, and questioning the mute horizon of the open sea.

And\nmy cabin which is engaged on board the Scotia?\"\n\n\"Oh, as for the Scotia, I advise you to give her up for the present.\"\n\n\"But,\" said Paganel after examining the vessel again, \"the Duncan is a\npleasure yacht.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Captain Mangles, \"and belongs to his lordship, Lord\nGlenarvan----\"\n\n\"Who begs you to make free use of his hospitality,\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\"A thousand thanks, my lord,\" replied Paganel; \"I am truly sensible\nto your courtesy. But permit me to make a simple remark. India is a\nbeautiful country. It offers marvelous surprises to travelers. These\nladies have probably never visited it. Well, the man at the helm needs\nonly to give a turn to the wheel, and the Duncan will go as easily to\nCalcutta as Concepcion.

He paused.\n\n\"Monsieur Paganel,\" said Lady Helena at length, \"if this were only a\npleasure voyage, I would answer: 'Let us all go to India,' and Lord\nGlenarvan would not disapprove. But the Duncan is going to recover\nsome shipwrecked sailors, abandoned on the coast of Patagonia; and she\ncannot change so humane a course.\"\n\nIn a few moments the Frenchman was acquainted with the situation of\naffairs, and learned, not without emotion, the providential discovery\nof the documents, the story of Captain Grant, and Lady Helena's\ngenerous proposal.\n\n\"Madam,\" said he, \"permit me to admire your conduct in all this, and to\nadmire it without reserve.

Some,\ndarting perpendicularly towards the earth, were repeated five or six\ntimes in the same place; others spread in zigzag lines, and produced on\nthe dark vault of the heavens astonishing jets of arborescent flame.]\n\nBut the approach of a mighty tempest brings to the hearts of most\nsentient beings a vague anxiety of which the bravest cannot divest\nthemselves. The occupants of the tree, agitated and fearful, could not\nclose their eyes, and the first thunder-clap found them all awake.\nIt took place about eleven o'clock, resembling a distant rumbling.\nGlenarvan climbed to the end of the branch, and peered out from the\nfoliage. The dark firmament was fitfully illumined by vivid and\nbrilliant flashes, which the waters brightly reflected, and which\ndisclosed great rifts in the clouds. Glenarvan, after surveying the\nzenith and the horizon, returned to his couch.\n\n\"What do you think, Glenarvan?\" asked Paganel.\n\n\"I think that the storm is beginning, and, if it continues, it will be\nterrible.\"\n\n\"So much the better,\" replied the enthusiastic Paganel. \"I like a fine\nspectacle, especially when I cannot avoid it. Only one thing would make\nme anxious, if anxiety served to avert danger,\" added he, \"and that\nis, that the culminating point of this plain is the ombu upon which we\nare perched. A lightning-conductor would be very useful here, for this\nvery tree among all those of the Pampas is the one that particularly\nattracts the lightning. And then, as you are aware, my friends,\nmeteorologists advise us not to take refuge under trees during a storm.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the major, \"that is timely advice.\"\n\n\"It must be confessed, Paganel,\" replied Glenarvan, \"that you choose a\ngood time to tell us these encouraging things!\"\n\n\"Bah!\" replied Paganel; \"all times are good to receive information. Ah,\nit is beginning!\"\n\n[Sidenote: AN EXTRAORDINARY STORM.]\n\nViolent thunder-claps interrupted this conversation, and their\nintensity increased till they reached the most deafening peals.\nThey soon became sonorous, and made the atmosphere vibrate in rapid\noscillations. The firmament was on fire, and during this commotion\nit was impossible to distinguish from what electric spark emanated\nthe indefinitely-prolonged rumblings that reverberated throughout the\nabysses of the sky.\n\nThe incessant flashes assumed various forms. Some, darting\nperpendicularly towards the earth, were repeated five or six times in\nthe same place; others, separating into a thousand different branches,\nspread in zigzag lines and produced on the dark vault of the heavens\nastonishing jets of arborescent flame. Soon the sky, from east to\nnorth, was crossed by a phosphorescent band of intense brilliancy. This\nillumination gradually overspread the entire horizon, lighting up the\nclouds like a bonfire, and was reflected in the mirror-like waters,\nforming what seemed to be an immense circle of fire, of which the tree\noccupied the centre.\n\nGlenarvan and his companions watched this terrific spectacle in\nsilence. Sheets of dazzling light glided towards them, and blinding\nflashes followed in rapid succession, now showing the calm countenance\nof the major, then the speculative face of Paganel or the energetic\nfeatures of Glenarvan, and again the frightened look of Robert or the\nunconcerned expression of the sailors. The rain, however, did not fall\nas yet, nor had the wind risen. But soon the flood-gates of the heavens\nopened, and the rain came down in torrents, the drops, as they struck\nthe surface of the water, rebounding in thousands of sparks illuminated\nby the incessant lightning.\n\nDid this rain predict the end of the storm? Were Glenarvan and his\ncompanions to be released with a few thorough drenchings? At the height\nof this struggle of the elements, suddenly there appeared at the end\nof the branch which extended horizontal"}, {"chunk_id": 75, "text": "ed his\nplace at the head of the party, without saying either what he hoped or\nwhat he feared.\n\nThese manoeuvres, many times repeated, puzzled Paganel and annoyed\nGlenarvan. The geographer was accordingly requested to interrogate\nthe Indian, which he did at once. Thalcave replied that he was\nastonished to see the plain so soaked with moisture. Never within his\nrecollection, since he had performed the office of guide, had his feet\ntrodden a soil so saturated. Even in the season of the great rains the\nArgentine plain was always easily passed.\n\n\"But to what do you attribute this increasing moisture?\" asked Paganel.\n\n\"I know not,\" replied the Indian; \"and what if I did?\"\n\n\"Do the mountain streams, when swollen with the rains, ever overflow\ntheir banks?\"\n\n\"Sometimes.\"\n\n\"And now, perhaps?\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said Thalcave.\n\nPaganel was forced to be contented with this answer, and communicated\nto Glenarvan the result of the conversation.\n\n\"And what does Thalcave advise?\" inquired Glenarvan.\n\n\"What is to be done?\" asked Paganel of the Patagonian.\n\n\"Advance quickly,\" replied the Indian.\n\nThis advice was easier to give than to follow. The horses were quickly\nfatigued with treading a soil that sank beneath them deeper and deeper\nas they progressed, so that this part of the plain might have been\ncompared to an immense basin in which the invading waters would rapidly\naccumulate. It was advisable, therefore, to cross without delay these\nsloping terraces that an inundation would have instantly transformed\ninto a lake.\n\nThey hastened their pace, though there was no great depth to the water\nwhich spread out in a sheet beneath the horses' feet. About two o'clock\nthe flood-gates of the heavens opened, and tropical torrents of rain\ndescended. Never was a finer opportunity presented for showing oneself\na philosopher. There was no chance of escaping this deluge, and it was\nbetter for the travelers to receive it stoically. Their ponchos were\nsoon dripping, and their hats wet them still more, like roofs whose\ngutters have overflowed. The fringes of the saddle-cloths seemed so\nmany liquid streams; and the horsemen, bespattered by their animals,\nwhose hoofs splashed in the water at every step, rode in a double\nshower, which came from the ground as well as the sky.\n\n[Sidenote: HYDROPATHIC TREATMENT.]\n\nIt was in this wretchedly cold and exhausted state that they arrived,\ntowards evening, at a very miserable rancho. Only people who were not\nfastidious could have given it the name of a shelter, only travelers in\ndistress would consent to occupy it. But Glenarvan and his companions\nhad no choice. They therefore cowered down in the abandoned hut which\nwould not have satisfied even a poor Indian of the plains. A sorry\nfire of grass, which gave out more smoke than heat, was kindled with\ndifficulty. The torrents of rain made havoc without, and large drops\noozed through the mouldy thatch. The fire was extinguished twenty\ntimes, and twenty times did Wilson and Mulready struggle against the\ninvading water.\n\nThe supper was very meagre and comfortless, and every one's appetite\nfailed. The major alone did justice to the water-soaked repast, and did\nnot lose a mouthful: he was superior to misfortune. As for Paganel,\nlike a Frenchman, he tried to joke; but now he failed.\n\n\"My jokes are wet,\" said he: \"they miss fire.\"\n\nHowever, as it was more agreeable--if possible, under the\ncircumstances--to sleep, each one sought in slumber a temporary\nforgetfulness of his fatigues.\n\nThe night was stormy. The sides of the rancho cracked as if they would\nbreak, while the frail structure bent beneath the gusts of wind and\nthreatened to give way at every shock. The unfortunate horses neighed\nin terror without, exposed to the inclemency of the tempest; and their\nmasters did not suffer less in their miserable shelter. However, sleep\ndrowned all their troubles at last. Robert first closed his eyes,\nreclining his head on Lord Glenarvan's shoulder; and soon all the\ninmates of the rancho slept under"}, {"chunk_id": 105, "text": " added.\n\n\"Very well, captain,\" replied Glenarvan.\n\n\"And Lady Helena and Miss Grant?\"\n\n\"I will inform them only at the last moment, when all hope is gone of\nkeeping at sea. You will tell me.\"\n\n\"I will, my lord.\"\n\nGlenarvan returned to the ladies, who, without knowing all the danger,\nfelt it to be imminent. They displayed, however, a noble courage, equal\nat least to that of their companions. Paganel gave himself up to the\nmost unreasonable theories concerning the direction of atmospheric\ncurrents, while the major awaited the end with the indifference of a\nMussulman.\n\nAbout eleven o'clock the hurricane seemed to moderate a little, the\nheavy mists were gradually dissipated, and through the openings the\ncaptain could see a low land at least six miles to leeward. He steered\ndirectly for it. Huge waves rolled to a prodigious height, and he knew\nthat they must have a firm point of support to reach such an elevation.\n\n\"There are sand-bars here,\" said he to Tom Austin.\n\n\"That is my opinion,\" replied the mate.\n\n\"We are in the hands of God,\" continued the captain. \"If He does not\nhimself guide the Duncan over the bar, we are lost.\"\n\n\"It is high tide now, captain; perhaps we may do it.\"\n\n\"But see the fury of those waves! What ship could resist them? God help\nus, my friend!\"\n\nMeantime the Duncan dashed towards the shore with terrible swiftness.\nSoon she was only two miles from the sand-bars. The mists still\ncontinued to conceal the land. Nevertheless Captain Mangles thought he\nperceived, beyond this foaming barrier, a tranquil haven, where the\nDuncan would be in comparative safety. But how to reach it?\n\nHe called the passengers on deck, for he did not wish, when the hour\nof shipwreck had come, that they should be confined in the cabin.\nGlenarvan and his companions gazed at the awful sea. Mary Grant grew\npale.\n\n\"John,\" said Glenarvan in a low tone to the young captain, \"I will try\nto save my wife, or will perish with her. Do you take charge of Miss\nGrant.\"\n\n[Sidenote: OILY INFLUENCES.]\n\n\"Yes, your lordship,\" was the prompt reply.\n\nThe Duncan was now only a few cable-lengths from the sand-bars. As it\nwas high tide, there would doubtless have been sufficient water to\nenable the yacht to cross these dangerous shoals; but the enormous\nwaves upon which she rose and fell would infallibly have wrecked her.\nWas there then any means of allaying these billows, of calming this\ntumultuous sea?\n\nA sudden idea occurred to the captain.\n\n\"The oil!\" cried he; \"pour on oil, men, pour on oil!\"\n\nThese words were quickly understood by all the crew. They were about\nto employ a method that sometimes succeeds. The fury of the sea can\noften be appeased by covering it with a sheet of oil, which floats\non the surface and destroys the shock of the waters. The effect is\ninstantaneous, but transient. As soon as a ship has crossed this\ntreacherous sea, it redoubles its fury; and woe to those who would\nventure to follow.\n\nThe barrels containing the supply of seal-oil were hoisted into the\nforecastle by the crew, to whom the danger gave new strength. Here\nthey were stove in with a blow of the hatchet, and suspended over the\nstarboard rattlings.\n\n\"Hold on!\" cried the captain, waiting for the favorable moment.\n\nIn a few seconds the yacht reached the entrance to the pass, which was\nbarred by a terrible line of foam.\n\n\"Let go!\" cried the young captain.\n\nThe barrels were inverted, and from their sides streamed floods of oil.\nImmediately the unctuous liquid leveled the foaming surface of the sea,\nand the Duncan sailed on calm waters, and was soon in a quiet harbor\nbeyond the terrible sand-bars; and then the ocean, released from its\nfetters, bounded after its escaped prey with indescribable fury.\n\n[Illustration: \"Let go!\" cried the young captain.

The\ndanger was increasing every moment. Already the broken stakes were\nyielding to the teeth and claws of the wolves. But neither Glenarvan\nnor Thalcave appeared willing to yield. The Indian had drawn Glenarvan\ntowards the entrance of the inclosure. He pointed to the plain, now\nfree from wolves. In his animated language, he explained that not a\nmoment was to be lost; that the danger, if this plan failed, would be\ngreater for those who remained; in short, that he alone knew Thaouka\nwell enough to employ his marvelous agility and speed for the common\nsafety. Glenarvan blindly persisted in his resolve to sacrifice\nhimself, when suddenly he was pushed violently back. Thaouka pranced,\nreared on his hind legs, and all at once, with a spring, cleared the\nbarrier of fire and the rampart of bodies, while a boyish voice cried,--\n\n\"God save you, my lord!\"\n\nGlenarvan and Thalcave had scarcely time to perceive Robert, who,\nclinging to the horse's mane, disappeared in the darkness.\n\n\"Robert, unfortunate!\" cried Glenarvan.\n\nBut these words the Indian himself could not hear. Frightful howls\nresounded. The wolves, starting on the track of the horse, fled into\nthe darkness with a terrible speed.\n\nThalcave and Glenarvan rushed out of the ramada. Already the plain had\nresumed its tranquillity, and they could scarcely distinguish a moving\nline which undulated afar in the shadows of the night.\n\nGlenarvan sank upon the ground, overcome, in despair, clasping his\nhands. He gazed at Thalcave, who smiled with his accustomed calmness.\n\n\"Thaouka--good horse--brave child--he will be saved!\" he repeated,\nnodding his head.\n\n\"But if he falls?\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\"He will not fall!\"\n\nIn spite of Thalcave's confidence, his companion passed the night in\nterrible anguish. He was no longer even mindful of the danger still to\nbe feared from the wolves. He would have gone in search of Robert, but\nthe Indian restrained him, and explained that their horses could not\novertake the boy, that Thaouka must have distanced his enemies, and\ncould not be found in the darkness. They must wait for day to start in\nsearch of Robert.\n\nAt four o'clock in the morning day began to break. The mists of the\nhorizon were soon tinged with pale rays. A sparkling dew covered the\nplain, and the tall grass began to wave under the first breezes of the\ndawn.\n\nThe moment of departure had arrived.\n\n\"Forward!\" said the Indian.\n\nGlenarvan did not reply, but sprang upon Robert's horse, and the two\nwere soon galloping towards the west in the direction from which their\ncompanions were to come.\n\nFor an hour they traveled thus with great speed, gazing around for\nRobert, and dreading at each step to behold his mangled body. Glenarvan\ntortured the flanks of his horse with his spurs. Suddenly shots were\nheard, and reports at regular intervals, like signals for recognition.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"It is they!\" cried Glenarvan.\n\nThalcave and he urged their horses to a more rapid pace, and a few\nmoments afterwards they joined the party led by Paganel.\n\n[Sidenote: LIVELY GRATITUDE.]\n\nTo Glenarvan's joy, Robert was there, alive, borne by the noble\nThaouka, who neighed with pleasure at seeing his master.\n\n\"Ah, my boy! my boy!\" cried Glenarvan, with unspeakable tenderness; and\nRobert and he, dismounting, rushed into each other's arms.\n\nThen it was the Indian's turn to clasp to his breast the courageous son\nof Captain Grant.\n\n\"He lives! he lives!\" exclaimed Glenarvan.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Robert, \"thanks to Thaouka.\"\n\nThe Indian had not waited for these words of gratitude to embrace his\nhorse, but at that very moment he spoke to him and embraced him, as\nif human blood flowed in the veins of the noble animal.

You\nstill intend, my lord, to deliver me into the hands of the English\nauthorities?\"\n\n\"Yes, Ayrton; it is only justice.\"\n\n\"I do not deny it,\" replied the quartermaster. \"You would not consent,\nthen, to set me at liberty?\"\n\nGlenarvan hesitated before answering a question so plainly asked.\nPerhaps the fate of Harry Grant depended upon what he was about to say.\nHowever, the feeling of duty towards humanity prevailed, and he said:\n\n\"No, Ayrton, I cannot set you at liberty.\"\n\n\"I do not ask it,\" replied the quartermaster, proudly.\n\n\"What do you wish, then?\"\n\n\"An intermediate fate, my lord, between that which you think awaits me\nand the liberty that you cannot grant me.\"\n\n\"And that is----?\"\n\n\"To abandon me on one of the desert islands of the Pacific, with the\nprincipal necessaries of life. I will manage as I can, and repent, if I\nhave time.\"\n\nGlenarvan, who was little prepared for this proposal, glanced at his\ntwo friends, who remained silent. After a few moments of reflection, he\nreplied:\n\n\"Ayrton, if I grant your request, will you tell me all that it is for\nmy interest to know?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord; that is to say, all that I know concerning Captain Grant\nand the Britannia.\"\n\n\"The whole truth?\"\n\n\"The whole.\"\n\n\"But who will warrant----?\"\n\n\"Oh, I see what troubles you, my lord. You do not like to trust to\nme,--to the word of a malefactor! That is right. But what can you do?\nThe situation is thus. You have only to accept or refuse.\"\n\n\"I will trust you, Ayrton,\" said Glenarvan, simply.\n\n\"And you will be right, my lord. Moreover, if I deceive you, you will\nalways have the power to revenge yourself.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"By recapturing me on this island, from which I shall not be able to\nescape.\"\n\nAyrton had a reply for everything. He met all difficulties, and\nproduced unanswerable arguments against himself. As was seen, he\nstrove to treat in his business with good faith. It was impossible for\na person to surrender with more perfect confidence, and yet he found\nmeans to advance still further in this disinterested course.\n\n\"My lord and gentlemen,\" added he, \"I desire that you should be\nconvinced that I am honorable. I do not seek to deceive you, but am\ngoing to give you a new proof of my sincerity in this affair. I act\nfrankly, because I rely upon your loyalty.\"\n\n\"Go on, Ayrton,\" replied Glenarvan.\n\n\"My lord, I have not yet your promise to agree to my proposition, and\nstill I do not hesitate to tell you that I know little concerning Harry\nGrant.\"\n\n\"Little!\" cried Glenarvan.\n\n\"Yes, my lord; the circumstances that I am able to communicate to\nyou are relative to myself. They are personal experiences, and will\nscarcely tend to put you on the track you have lost.\"\n\n[Sidenote: REVELATIONS AND DISCLOSURES.]\n\nA keen disappointment was manifest on the features of Glenarvan and\nthe major.

He became Thalcave's\nshadow, and could not remain quiet in the presence of a real\nPatagonian, in comparison with whom he would have passed for a dwarf.\nHe overwhelmed the grave Indian with Spanish phrases, to which the\nlatter quietly listened. The geographer studied this time without a\nbook, and was often heard repeating words aloud.\n\n\"If I do not get the accent,\" said he to the major, \"you must not be\nangry with me. Who would have thought that one day a Patagonian would\nteach me Spanish!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\nNEWS OF THE LOST CAPTAIN.\n\n\nAt eight o'clock the next morning Thalcave gave the signal for\ndeparture. The slope was gradual, and the travelers had only to descend\na gentle declivity to the sea.\n\nWhen the Patagonian declined the horse that Glenarvan offered him, the\nlatter thought that he preferred to go on foot, according to the custom\nof certain guides; and indeed, his long legs ought to have made walking\neasy. But he was mistaken.\n\nAt the moment of departure Thalcave whistled in a peculiar manner.\nImmediately a magnificent Argentine horse, of superb form, issued from\na small wood near by, and approached at the call of his master. The\nanimal was perfectly beautiful. His brown color indicated a sound,\nspirited and courageous beast. He had a small and elegantly poised\nhead, widely opening nostrils, a fiery eye, large hams, swelling\nwithers, broad breast, long pasterns, in short, all the qualities that\nconstitute strength and suppleness. The major, like a perfect horseman,\nadmired unreservedly this specimen of the horses of the plains. This\nbeautiful creature was called Thaouka, which means \"bird\" in the\nPatagonian language, and he justly merited this appellation.\n\n[Sidenote: A FRESH START.]\n\nWhen Thalcave was in the saddle, the horse pranced with spirited grace,\nand the Patagonian, a skillful rider, was magnificent to behold. His\noutfit comprised two weapons of the chase, the \"bolas\" and the lasso.\nThe bolas consists of three balls tied together by a leathern string,\nwhich are fastened to the front of the saddle. The Indians frequently\nthrow them the distance of a hundred paces at the animal or enemy that\nthey are pursuing, and with such precision that they twist about their\nlegs and bring them to the ground. It is, therefore, in their hands a\nformidable instrument, and they handle it with surprising dexterity.\nThe lasso, on the contrary, does not leave the hand that wields it. It\nconsists simply of a leathern thong thirty feet in length, terminating\nin a slip-noose which works upon an iron ring. The right hand throws\nthe slip-noose, while the left hand holds the remainder of the lasso,\nthe end of which is firmly tied to the saddle. A long carbine in a\nsling completed the Patagonian's armament.\n\nThalcave, without observing the admiration caused by his natural\ngrace, ease and courage, took the lead, and the party advanced, now\nat a gallop, and now at a walk, for their horses seemed entirely\nunaccustomed to trotting. Robert mounted with much boldness, and\nspeedily convinced Glenarvan of his ability to keep his seat.\n\nOn issuing from the gorges of the Andes, they encountered a great\nnumber of sand-ridges, called \"medanos,\" real waves incessantly\nagitated by the wind, when the roots of the herbage did not confine\nthem to the earth. This sand is of an extreme fineness; and, at the\nleast breath, they saw it float away in light clouds, or form regular\nsand-columns which rose to a considerable height. This spectacle caused\npleasure as well as annoyance to the eyes. Pleasure, for nothing was\nmore curious than these columns, wandering over the plain, struggling,\nmingling, sinking and rising in inexpressible confusion; and annoyance,\nsince an impalpable dust emanated from these innumerable medanos and\npenetrated the eyelids, however tightly they were closed.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThis phenomenon continued during a great part of the day. Nevertheless,\nthey advanced rapidly, and towards six o'clock the A"}, {"chunk_id": 78, "text": "tives\nwith a terrible roar. Men and beasts, everything, disappeared in a\nwhirlpool of foam. A ponderous liquid mass engulfed them in its furious\ntide. When the deluge had passed, the men regained the surface, and\nrapidly counted their numbers; but the horses, except Thaouka, had\ndisappeared forever.\n\n\"Courage! courage!\" cried Glenarvan, who supported Paganel with one arm\nand swam with the other.\n\n\"All right! all right!\" replied the worthy geographer; \"indeed I am not\nsorry----\"\n\nWhat was he not sorry for? No one ever knew; for the poor man was\nforced to swallow the end of his sentence in half a pint of muddy water.\n\nThe major calmly advanced, taking a regular stroke of which the most\nskillful swimmer would not have been ashamed. The sailors worked their\nway along like porpoises in their native element. As for Robert, he\nclung to Thaouka's mane, and was thus drawn along. The horse proudly\ncut the waters, and kept himself instinctively on a line with the tree,\ntowards which the current bore him, and which was now not far distant.\n\nIn a few moments the entire party reached it. It was fortunate; for, if\nthis refuge had failed, all chance of safety would have vanished, and\nthey must have perished in the waves. The water was up to the top of\nthe trunk where the main branches grew, so that it was easy to grasp\nthem.\n\nThalcave, leaving his horse, and lifting Robert, seized the first limb,\nand soon his powerful arms had lodged the exhausted swimmers in a place\nof safety. But Thaouka, carried away by the current, was rapidly\ndisappearing. He turned his intelligent head towards his master, and,\nshaking his long mane, neighed for him beseechingly.\n\n[Illustration: A huge wave, forty feet high, overwhelmed the fugitives\nwith a terrible roar. Men and beasts, everything, disappeared in a\nwhirlpool of foam. A ponderous liquid mass engulfed them in its furious\ntide.]\n\n\"Do you abandon him?\" said Paganel.\n\n\"I?\" cried the Indian, and, plunging into the tempestuous waters, he\nreappeared some distance from the tree. A few moments after, his arm\nrested upon the neck of Thaouka, and horse and horseman swam away\ntogether towards the misty horizon of the north.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII.\n\nA SINGULAR ABODE.\n\n\nThe tree upon which Glenarvan and his companions had just found refuge\nresembled a walnut-tree. It had the same shining foliage and rounded\nform. It was the \"ombu,\" which is met with only on the Argentine\nPlains. It had an enormous, twisted trunk, and was confined to the\nearth not only by its great roots, but also by strong shoots which held\nit most tenaciously. It had thus resisted the force of the inundation.\n\n[Sidenote: AN ORNITHOLOGICAL OMNIUM-GATHERUM.]\n\nThis ombu measured one hundred feet in height, and might have covered\nwith its shade a circumference of three hundred and sixty feet. All\nthe upper part rested on three great branches, which forked from the\ntop of the trunk, that was six feet in diameter. Two of these branches\nwere nearly perpendicular, and supported the immense canopy of foliage,\nwhose crossed, twisted, and interlaced limbs, as if woven by the hand\nof a basket-maker, formed an impenetrable shelter. The third branch,\non the contrary, extended almost horizontally over the roaring waters;\nits leaves were bathed in them, while it seemed a promontory to this\nisland of verdure surrounded by an ocean. There was abundant space,\nalso, in the interior of this gigantic tree. The foliage, which was\nnot very dense at its outer circumference, left large openings like\nsky-lights, and made it well ventilated and cool. At sight of these\nbranches rising in innumerable ramifications towards the clouds, while\nthe parasitic convolvuli bound them to each other, and the rays of the\nsun shone through the interstices of the leaves, you would really have\nthought that the trunk of this ombu bore upon itself alone an entire\nforest.\n\nOn the arrival of the fugitives, a feathered population flew away to\nthe top branches, protesting by their cries against so flagran"}, {"chunk_id": 92, "text": "e's\nhoofs was heard upon the plain, and the tall form of the Indian emerged\nfrom the darkness.\n\n[Illustration: The sound of a horse's hoofs was heard upon the plain,\nand the tall form of the Indian emerged from the darkness.]\n\n\n\"Thalcave!\" cried Robert.\n\n\"Thalcave!\" repeated his companions, as with one voice.\n\n\"Friends!\" said the Patagonian, who had waited for them there, knowing\nthat the current would carry them as it had carried him.\n\nAt the same moment he raised Robert in his arms and clasped him to his\nbreast. Glenarvan, the major, and the sailors, delighted to see their\nfaithful guide again, shook his hands with the most earnest cordiality.\nThe Patagonian then conducted them to an abandoned estancia. Here\na good fire was burning, which revived them, and on the coals were\nroasting succulent slices of venison, to which they did ample justice.\nAnd when their refreshed minds began to reflect, they could scarcely\nbelieve that they had escaped so many perils,--the fire, the water, and\nthe formidable alligators.\n\nThalcave, in a few words, told his story to Paganel, and ascribed to\nhis intrepid horse all the honor of having saved him. Paganel then\nendeavored to explain to him the new interpretation of the document,\nand the hopes it led them to entertain. Did the Indian understand the\ngeographer's ingenious suppositions? It was very doubtful; but he saw\nhis friends happy and very confident, and he desired nothing more.\n\nIt may be easily believed that these courageous travelers, after their\nday of rest on the tree, needed no urging to resume their journey. At\neight o'clock in the morning they were ready to start. They were too\nfar south to procure means of transport, and were therefore obliged\nto travel on foot. The distance, however, was only forty miles, and\nThaouka would not refuse to carry from time to time a tired pedestrian.\nIn thirty-six hours they would reach the shores of the Atlantic.\n\n[Sidenote: IN THE DARK.]\n\nAs soon as refreshed the guide and his companions left behind them\nthe immense basin, still covered with the waters, and proceeded across\nelevated plains, on which, here and there, were seen groves planted by\nEuropeans, meadows, and occasionally native trees. Thus the day passed.\n\nThe next morning, fifteen miles before reaching the ocean, its\nproximity was perceptible. They hastened on in order to reach Lake\nSalado, on the shores of the Atlantic, the same day. They were\nbeginning to feel fatigued, when they perceived sand-hills that hid the\nfoaming waves, and soon the prolonged murmur of the rising tide struck\nupon their ears.\n\n\"The ocean!\" cried Paganel.\n\n\"Yes, the ocean!\" replied Thalcave.\n\nAnd these wanderers, whose strength had seemed almost about to fail,\nclimbed the mounds with wonderful agility. But the darkness was\nprofound, and their eyes wandered in vain over the gloomy expanse. They\nlooked for the Duncan, but could not discern her.\n\n\"She is there, at all events,\" said Glenarvan, \"waiting for us.\"\n\n\"We shall see her to-morrow,\" replied MacNabb.\n\nTom Austin shouted seaward, but received no answer. The wind was very\nstrong, and the sea tempestuous. The clouds were driving from the west,\nand the foaming crests of the waves broke over the beach in masses of\nspray. If the Duncan was at the appointed rendezvous, the lookout man\ncould neither hear nor be heard. The coast afforded no shelter. There\nwas no bay, no harbor, no cove; not even a creek. The beach consisted\nof long sand-banks that were lost in the sea, and the vicinity of\nwhich is more dangerous than that of the rocks in the face of wind and\ntide. These banks, in fact, increase the waves; the sea is peculiarly\nboisterous around them, and ships are sure to be lost if they strike on\nthese bars in heavy storms.\n\nIt was therefore very natural that the Duncan, considering this coast\ndangerous, and knowing it to be without a port of shelter, kept at a\ndistance. Captain Mangles must have kept to the windward as far as\npossible. This was Tom Austin's opinion, a"}]}

What,\nmoreover, could ten defenceless men do against thirty well-armed\nsavages? Besides, Glenarvan thought it likely that Kai-Koumou's tribe\nhad lost some chief of high rank whom they were particularly anxious to\nrecover; and he was not mistaken.\n\nThe next day the canoe ascended the river with increased swiftness.\nIt stopped for a moment at the junction of a small river which wound\nacross the plains on the right bank. Here another canoe, with ten\nnatives on board, joined Kai-Koumou. The warriors merely exchanged\nsalutations, and then continued their course. The new-comers had\nrecently fought against the English troops, as could be seen by their\ntattered garments, their gory weapons, and the wounds that still bled\nbeneath their rags. They were gloomy and taciturn, and, with the\nindifference common to all savage races, paid no attention to the\ncaptives.\n\nTowards evening Kai-Koumou landed at the foot of the mountains,\nwhose nearer ridges reached precipitously to the river-bank. Here\ntwenty natives, who had disembarked from their canoes, were making\npreparations for the night. Fires blazed beneath the trees. A chief,\nequal in rank to Kai-Koumou, advanced with measured pace, and, rubbing\nhis nose against that of the latter, saluted him cordially. The\nprisoners were stationed in the centre of the encampment, and guarded\nwith extreme vigilance.\n\nThe next morning the ascent of the Waikato was resumed. Other boats\ncame from various affluents of the river. Sixty warriors, evidently\nfugitives from the last insurrection, had now assembled, and were\nreturning, more or less wounded in the fray, to the mountain districts.\nSometimes a song arose from the canoes, as they advanced in single\nfile. One native struck up the patriotic ode of the mysterious \"Pihé,\"\nthe national hymn that calls the Maoris to battle. The full and\nsonorous voice of the singer waked the echoes of the mountains; and\nafter each stanza his comrades struck their breasts, and sang the\nwarlike verses in chorus. Then they seized their oars again, and the\ncanoes were headed up stream.\n\nDuring the day a singular sight enlivened the voyage. About four\no'clock the canoe, without lessening its speed, guided by the steady\nhand of the chief, dashed through a narrow gorge. Eddies broke\nviolently against numerous small islands, which rendered navigation\nexceeding dangerous. Never could it be more hazardous to capsize, for\nthe banks afforded no refuge, and whoever had set foot on the porous\ncrust of the shore would probably have perished. At this point the\nriver flowed between warm springs, oxide of iron colored the muddy\nground a brilliant red, and not a yard of firm earth could be seen.\nThe air was heavy with a penetrating sulphureous odor. The natives did\nnot regard it, but the captives were seriously annoyed by the noxious\nvapors exhaled from the fissures of the soil and the bubbles that\nburst and discharged their gaseous contents. Yet, however disagreeable\nthese emanations were, the eye could not but admire this magnificent\nspectacle.\n\n[Illustration: At this point the river flowed between warm springs, and\nnot a yard of firm earth could be seen.]\n\nThe canoes soon after entered a dense cloud of white smoke, whose\nwreaths rose in gradually decreasing circles above the river. On the\nshores a hundred geysers, some shooting forth masses of vapor, and\nothers overflowing in liquid columns, varied their effects, like the\njets and cascades of a fountain. It seemed as though some engineer was\ndirecting at his pleasure the outflowings of these springs, as the\nwaters and vapor, mingling in the air, formed rainbows in the sunbeams.\n\nFor two miles the canoes glided within this vapory atmosphere,\nenveloped in its warm waves that rolled along the surface of the water.\nThen the sulphureous smoke disappeared, and a pure swift current of\nfresh air refreshed the panting voyagers. The region of the springs was\npassed.

He allowed this bloody orgy an hour to reach its utmost\nintensity. The last act of the funeral was played with the usual rites.\n\nThe bodies of Kara-Tété and his wife were taken up, and their limbs\nbent and gathered against the stomach, according to the New Zealand\ncustom. The place for the tomb had been chosen outside of the\nfortification, about two miles distant, on the summit of a small\nmountain, called Maunganamu, situated on the right shore of the lake.\n\nThither the bodies were to be carried. Two very rude palanquins, or\nrather litters, were brought to the foot of the mound. The corpses,\nfolded together, in a sitting posture, and tied in their clothes by a\ngirdle of withes, were placed on this primitive bier. Four warriors\nbore it between them, and the entire tribe, chanting the funeral hymn,\nfollowed them in procession to the place of burial.\n\nThe captives, who were always watched, saw them leave the inner\ninclosure of the pah, and then the songs and cries gradually died away.\nFor about half an hour this funeral escort continued in sight, in the\ndepths of the valley. Finally they perceived it again winding along\nthe mountain paths. The distance gave a fantastic appearance to the\nundulating movements of the long, sinuous column.\n\nThe tribe stopped at the summit of the mountain, which was eight\nhundred feet high, at the place prepared for Kara-Tété's interment.\nA common Maori would have had only a hole and a heap of stones for a\ngrave; but for a powerful and dreaded chief, destined doubtless for a\nspeedy deification, a tomb worthy of his exploits was reserved.\n\n[Sidenote: THE LAST NIGHT.]\n\nThe sepulchre had been surrounded by palisades, while stakes,\nornamented with faces reddened with ochre, stood beside the grave\nwhere the bodies were to lie. The relatives had not forgotten that the\n\"waidoua\" (the spirit of the dead) feeds on substantial nourishment\nlike the body during this perishable life. Food had therefore been\ndeposited in the inclosure, together with the weapons and clothes of\nthe deceased.\n\nNothing was wanting for the comfort of the tomb. Husband and wife were\nlaid side by side, and then covered with earth and grass after a series\nof renewed lamentations. Then the procession silently descended the\nmountain, and now no one could ascend it under penalty of death, for it\nwas tabooed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LI.\n\nSTRANGELY LIBERATED.\n\n\nJust as the sun was disappearing behind Lake Taupo, the captives were\nled back to their prison. They were not to leave it again until the\nsummit of the Wahiti mountains should kindle with the first beams of\nthe day. One night remained to prepare for death. In spite of the\nfaintness, in spite of the horror with which they were seized, they\nshared their repast in common.\n\n\"We shall need all the strength possible to face death,\" said\nGlenarvan. \"We must show these barbarians how Europeans and Christians\ncan die.\"\n\nThe meal being finished, Lady Helena repeated the evening prayer aloud,\nwhile all her companions, with uncovered heads, joined her. Having\nfulfilled this duty, and enjoyed this privilege, the prisoners embraced\neach other. Lady Helena and Mary Grant then retired to one corner of\nthe hut, and stretched themselves upon a mat. Sleep, which soothes all\nwoes, soon closed their eyes, and they slumbered in each other's arms,\novercome by fatigue and long wakefulness.\n\nGlenarvan, taking his friends aside, said:\n\n\"My dear companions, our lives and those of these poor ladies are in\nGod's hands.

No native was seen; only the\nsentinels guarded in turn at the door of their prison.\n\nBut on the third day the huts were opened. The savages, men, women,\nand children, to the number of several hundreds, assembled in the pah,\nsilent and calm. Kai-Koumou came out of his house, and, surrounded by\nthe principal warriors of his tribe, took his place on a mound several\nfeet high in the centre of the fortification. The crowd of natives\nformed a semicircle around him, and the whole assembly preserved\nabsolute silence.\n\nAt a sign from the chief, a warrior advanced towards the temple.\n\n\"Remember!\" said Lady Helena to her husband.\n\nGlenarvan clasped his wife to his heart. At this moment Mary Grant\napproached John Mangles.\n\n\"Lord and Lady Glenarvan,\" said she, \"I think that, if a wife can die\nby the hand of her husband to escape a degrading existence, a maiden\ncan likewise die by the hand of her lover. John (for I may tell you\nat this critical moment), have I not long been your betrothed in the\ndepths of your heart? May I rely upon you, dear John, as Lady Helena\ndoes upon Lord Glenarvan?\"\n\n\"Mary!\" cried the young captain, in terror. \"Ah! dear Mary----\"\n\nHe could not finish: the mat was raised, and the captives were dragged\ntowards Kai-Koumou. The two women were resigned to their fate, while\nthe men concealed their anguish beneath a calmness that showed\nsuperhuman self-control. They came before the chief, who did not delay\nsentence.\n\n\"You killed Kara-Tété!\" said he to Glenarvan.\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n[Sidenote: THE BEGINNING OF THE END.]\n\n\"You shall die to-morrow at sunrise.\"\n\n\"Alone?\" inquired Glenarvan, whose heart beat quickly.\n\n\"What! as if our Tohonga's life were not more precious than yours!\"\ncried Kai-Koumou, whose eyes expressed a fierce regret.\n\nAt this moment a commotion took place among the natives. Glenarvan cast\na rapid glance around him. The crowd opened, and a warrior, dripping\nwith sweat and overcome with fatigue, appeared.\n\nAs soon as Kai-Koumou perceived him, he said in English, evidently that\nhe might be understood by the captives:\n\n\"You come from the camp of the pale-faces?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the Maori.\n\n\"You saw the prisoner, our Tohonga?\"\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n\"Is he living?\"\n\n\"He is dead! The English have shot him.\"\n\nThe fate of Glenarvan and his companions was settled.\n\n\"You shall all die to-morrow at daybreak!\" cried Kai-Koumou.\n\nThe unfortunates were therefore to suffer a common death. Lady Helena\nand Mary Grant raised towards heaven a look of thankfulness.\n\nThe captives were not taken back to the temple. They were to attend\nthat day the funeral of the dead chief, and the bloody ceremonies\nconnected therewith. A party of natives conducted them to the foot of\nan enormous koudi, where these guardians remained without losing sight\nof their prisoners. The rest of the tribe, absorbed in their official\nmourning, seemed to have forgotten them.\n\nThe customary three days had elapsed since the death of Kara-Tété. The\nsoul of the deceased had therefore forever abandoned its mortal abode.\nThe sacred rites began.\n\nThe body was carried to a small mound in the centre of the\nfortification, clothed in splendid costume, and enveloped in a\nmagnificent flaxen mat. The head was adorned with plumes, and wore a\ncrown of green leaves. The face, arms, and breast had been rubbed with\noil, and therefore showed no mortification.\n\nThe parents and friends of the deceased came to the foot of the\nmound, and all at once, as if some director were beating time to a\nfuneral dirge, a great concert of cries, groans, and sobs arose on the\nair. They mourned the dead in plaintive and modulated cadences. His\nrelations struck their heads together; his kinswomen lacerated their\nfaces with their nails, and showed themselves more lavish of blood than\nof tears. These unfortunate females conscientiously fulfilled their\nbarbarous duty.\n\nBut these demonstrations were not enough to appease the soul of the\ndeceased, whose wrath would doubtless hav"}, {"chunk_id": 186, "text": "ome still suffering from recent wounds, stood in perfect immobility,\nenveloped in their flaxen mantles. Three dogs of wild appearance were\nstretched at their feet. The eight rowers seemed to be servants or\nslaves of the chief. They worked vigorously, and the boat ascended the\ncurrent of the Waikato with remarkable swiftness.\n\nIn the centre of this long canoe, with feet tied, but hands free, were\nten European prisoners clinging closely to each other. They were Lord\nGlenarvan and his companions.\n\n[Sidenote: A TESTING TIME.]\n\nThe evening before, the little party, led astray by the dense fog, had\nencamped in the midst of a numerous tribe of natives. About midnight,\nthe travelers, surprised in their sleep, were made prisoners and\ncarried on board the canoe. They had not yet been maltreated, but had\ntried in vain to resist. Their arms and ammunition were in the hands of\nthe savages, and their own bullets would have quickly stretched them on\nthe earth had they attempted to escape.\n\nThey were not long in learning, by the aid of a few English words which\nthe natives used, that, being driven back by the British troops, they\nwere returning, vanquished and weakened, to the regions of the upper\nWaikato. Their chief, after an obstinate resistance, in which he lost\nhis principal warriors, was now on his way to rouse again the river\ntribes. He was called Kai-Koumou, a terrible name, which signified\nin the native language \"he who eats the limbs of his enemy.\" He was\nbrave and bold, but his cruelty equaled his bravery. No pity could be\nexpected from him. His name was well known to the English soldiers, and\na price had been set upon his head by the governor of New Zealand.\n\nThis terrible catastrophe had come upon Glenarvan just as he was\nabout reaching the long-desired harbor of Auckland, whence he would\nhave returned to his native country. Yet, looking at his calm and\npassionless countenance, you could not have divined the depth of his\nanguish, for in his present critical situation he did not betray the\nextent of his misfortunes. He felt that he ought to set an example of\nfortitude to his wife and his companions, as being the husband and\nchief. Moreover, he was ready to die first for the common safety, if\ncircumstances should require it.\n\n[Sidenote: CHIEFS, CIVILIZED AND UNCIVILIZED.]\n\nHis companions were worthy of him; they shared his noble thoughts, and\ntheir calm and haughty appearance would scarcely have intimated that\nthey were being carried away to captivity and suffering. By common\nconsent, at Glenarvan's suggestion, they had resolved to feign a proud\nindifference in the presence of the savages. It was the only way of\ninfluencing those fierce natures.\n\n[Illustration: A boat might have been seen ascending the Waikato. It\nwas a canoe seventy feet long and five broad.]\n\nSince leaving the encampment, the natives, taciturn like all savages,\nhad scarcely spoken to each other. However, from a few words exchanged,\nGlenarvan perceived that they were acquainted with the English\nlanguage. He therefore resolved to question the chief in regard to the\nfate that was in store for them. Addressing Kai-Koumou, he said, in a\nfearless tone:\n\n\"Where are you taking us, chief?\"\n\nKai-Koumou gazed at him coldly without answering.\n\n\"Say, what do you expect to do with us?\" continued Glenarvan.\n\nThe chief's eyes blazed with a sudden light, and in a stern voice he\nreplied:\n\n\"To exchange you, if your friends will ransom you; to kill you, if they\nrefuse.\"\n\nGlenarvan asked no more, but hope returned to his heart. Doubtless,\nsome chiefs of the Maori tribe had fallen into the hands of the\nEnglish, and the natives would attempt to recover them by way of\nexchange; their situation, therefore, was not one for despair.\n\nMeantime the canoe rapidly ascended the river. Paganel, whose\nchangeable disposition carried him from one extreme to another, had\nregained his hopefulness. He believed that the Maoris were sparing them\nthe fatigue of their journey to the English settlements, a"}, {"chunk_id": 202, "text": "d in on all sides.\n\n\"Let us go down,\" cried he, \"before our only way of escape is blocked\nup.\"\n\nBut just as the ladies rose by a final effort, MacNabb stopped them,\nand said:\n\n\"It is useless, Glenarvan. Look!\"\n\nAnd all saw, indeed, that an inexplicable change had taken place in the\nmovements of the Maoris. Their pursuit had been suddenly interrupted.\nTheir ascent of the mountain had ceased, as if by an imperious\ninterdict. The crowd of natives had checked their swiftness, and\nhalted, like the waves of the sea before an impassable rock.\n\nAll the savages, thirsting for blood, were now ranged along the foot\nof the mountain, yelling, gesticulating, and brandishing guns and\nhatchets; but they did not advance a single foot. Their dogs, like\nthemselves, as though chained to earth, howled with rage.\n\nWhat was the difficulty? What invisible power restrained the natives?\nThe fugitives gazed without comprehending, fearing that the charm that\nenchained Kai-Koumou's tribe would dissolve.\n\nSuddenly Captain Mangles uttered a cry that caused his companions to\nturn. He pointed to a little fortress at the summit of the peak.\n\n\"The tomb of the chief Kara-Tété!\" cried Robert.\n\n\"Are you in earnest?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"Yes, my lord, it is the tomb; I recognize it.\"\n\nRobert was right. Fifty feet above, at the extreme point of the\nmountain, stood a small palisaded inclosure of freshly-painted stakes.\nGlenarvan, likewise, recognized the sepulchre of the Maori chief. In\ntheir wanderings they had come to the top of the Maunganamu, where\nKara-Tété had been buried.\n\nFollowed by his companions, he climbed the sides of the peak, to the\nvery foot of the tomb. A large opening, covered with mats, formed the\nentrance. Glenarvan was about to enter, when, all at once, he started\nback suddenly.\n\n\"A savage!\" said he.\n\n\"A savage in this tomb?\" inquired the major.\n\n\"Yes, MacNabb.\"\n\n\"What matter? Let us enter.\"\n\nGlenarvan, the major, Robert, and Captain Mangles passed into the\ninclosure. A Maori was there, clad in a great flax mantle. The darkness\nof the sepulchre did not permit them to distinguish his features. He\nappeared very calm, and was eating his breakfast with the most perfect\nindifference.\n\nGlenarvan was about to address him, when the native, anticipating him,\nsaid, in an amiable tone, and in excellent English:\n\n\"Be seated, my dear lord; breakfast is awaiting you.\"\n\nIt was Paganel. At his voice all rushed into the tomb, and gazed with\nwonder at the worthy geographer. Paganel was found! The common safety\nwas represented in him. They were going to question him: they wished\nto know how and why he was on the top of the mountain; but Glenarvan\nchecked this unseasonable curiosity.\n\n[Illustration: \"Be seated, my dear lord; breakfast is awaiting you.\"]\n\n\"The savages!\" said he.\n\n\"The savages,\" replied Paganel, shrugging his shoulders, \"are\nindividuals whom I supremely despise.\"\n\n\"But can they not----?\"\n\n\"They! the imbeciles! Come and see them.\"\n\nEach followed Paganel, who issued from the tomb. The Maoris were in the\nsame place, surrounding the foot of the peak, and uttering terrible\ncries.\n\n\"Cry and howl till you are tired, miserable creatures!\" said Paganel.\n\"I defy you to climb this mountain!\"\n\n\"And why?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"Because the chief is buried here; this tomb protects us, and the\nmountain is tabooed.\"\n\n\"Tabooed?\"\n\n\"Yes, my friends; and that is why I took refuge here, as in one of\nthose asylums of the Middle Ages, open to unfortunates.\"\n\nIndeed, the mountain was tabooed, and by this consecration had become\ninaccessible by the superstitious savages.\n\nThe safety of the fugitives was not yet certain, but there was a\nsalutary respite, of which they strove to take advantage. Glenarvan, a\nprey to unspeakable emotion, did not venture a word; while the major\nnodded his head with an air of genuine satisfaction.\n\n\"And now, my friends,\" said Paganel, \"if these brutes expect us to test\ntheir patience they are mistaken.

Doubtless,\nsome chiefs of the Maori tribe had fallen into the hands of the\nEnglish, and the natives would attempt to recover them by way of\nexchange; their situation, therefore, was not one for despair.\n\nMeantime the canoe rapidly ascended the river. Paganel, whose\nchangeable disposition carried him from one extreme to another, had\nregained his hopefulness. He believed that the Maoris were sparing them\nthe fatigue of their journey to the English settlements, and that they\nwere certain to arrive at their destination. He was, therefore, quite\nresigned to his lot, and traced on his map the course of the Waikato\nacross the plains and valleys of the province. Lady Helena and Mary\nGrant, suppressing their terror, conversed in low tones with Glenarvan,\nand the most skillful physiognomist could not have detected on their\nfaces the anxiety of their hearts.\n\nThe Waikato River is worshiped by the natives, as Paganel knew, and\nEnglish and German naturalists have never ascended beyond its junction\nwith the Waipa. Whither did Kai-Koumou intend to take his captives?\nThe geographer could not have guessed if the word \"Taupo,\" frequently\nrepeated, had not attracted his attention. By consulting his map,\nhe saw that this name was applied to a celebrated lake in the most\nmountainous part of the island, and that from it the Waikato flows.\n\nPaganel, addressing Captain Mangles in French, so as not to be\nunderstood by the savages, asked him how fast the canoe was going. The\ncaptain thought about three miles an hour.\n\n\"Then,\" replied the geographer, \"if we do not travel during the night,\nour voyage to the lake will last about four days.\"\n\n\"But whereabouts are the English garrisons?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"It is difficult to say,\" replied Paganel. \"At all events, the war\nmust have reached the province of Taranaki, and probably the troops\nare collected beyond the mountains, on the side of the lake where the\nhabitations of the savages are concentrated.\"\n\n\"God grant it!\" said Lady Helena.\n\nGlenarvan cast a sorrowful glance at his young wife and Mary Grant,\nexposed to the mercy of these fierce natives, and captives in a wild\ncountry, far from all human assistance. But he saw that he was watched\nby Kai-Koumou, and, not wishing to show that one of the captives was\nhis wife, he prudently kept his thoughts to himself, and gazed at the\nbanks of the river with apparent indifference.\n\n[Sidenote: ACCESSIONS, AND PROGRESS.]\n\nThe sun was just sinking below the horizon as the canoe ran upon a bank\nof pumice-stones, which the Waikato carries with it from its source\nin the volcanic mountains. Several trees grew here, as if designed to\nshelter an encampment. Kai-Koumou landed his prisoners.\n\nThe men had their hands tied, the ladies were free. All were placed\nin the centre of the encampment, around which large fires formed an\nimpassable barrier.\n\nBefore Kai-Koumou had informed his captives of his intention to\nexchange them, Glenarvan and Captain Mangles had discussed various\nmethods of recovering their liberty. What they could not venture in the\nboat they hoped to attempt on land, at the hour for encamping, under\ncover of the night.\n\nBut since Glenarvan's conversation with the chief, it seemed wise to\nabandon this design. They must be patient. It was the most prudent\nplan. The exchange offered chances that neither an open attack nor a\nflight across these unknown regions could afford. Many circumstances\nmight indeed arise that would delay, and even prevent, such a\ntransaction; but still it was better to await the result. What,\nmoreover, could ten defenceless men do against thirty well-armed\nsavages? Besides, Glenarvan thought it likely that Kai-Koumou's tribe\nhad lost some chief of high rank whom they were particularly anxious to\nrecover; and he was not mistaken.\n\nThe next day the canoe ascended the river with increased swiftness.\nIt stopped for a moment at the junction of a small river which wound\nacross the plains on the right bank. Here a"}, {"chunk_id": 45, "text": "han two minutes.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said MacNabb; \"and was Robert on your right, or on your left?\"\n\n\"On my left. I remember that his poncho flapped in my face.\"\n\n\"And where were you situated in reference to us?\"\n\n\"On the left also.\"\n\n\"Then Robert could have disappeared only on this side,\" said the major,\nturning towards the mountain, and pointing to the right. \"And also\nconsidering the time that has elapsed since his disappearance, the\nchild must have fallen at a high part of the mountain. There we must\nsearch, and, by taking different ways, we shall find him.\"\n\nNot a word more was said. The six men, scaling the declivities of the\nmountain, stationed themselves at different heights along the ridge,\nand began their search. They kept always to the right of their line of\ndescent, sounding the smallest fissures, descending to the bottom of\nprecipices half filled with fragments of the mass; and more than one\ncame forth with his garments in shreds, his feet and hands lacerated,\nat the peril of his life.\n\n[Sidenote: A SLEEPLESS NIGHT.]\n\nAll this portion of the Andes, except a few inaccessible plateaus,\nwas carefully explored for many hours without one of these brave men\nthinking of rest. But it was a vain search. The child had not only\nfound death in the mountains, but also a tomb, the stone of which,\nmade of some enormous rock, was forever closed over him.\n\nTowards noon Glenarvan and his companions, bruised and exhausted, found\nthemselves again in the valley. The former was a prey to the most\nviolent grief. He scarcely spoke, and from his lips issued only these\nwords, broken by sighs,--\"I will not go; I will not go!\"\n\nEach understood this determination, and respected it.\n\n\"We will wait,\" said Paganel to the major and Tom Austin. \"Let us take\nsome rest, and recruit our strength. We shall need it, whether to begin\nour search or continue our journey.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied MacNabb, \"let us remain, since Edward wishes it. He\nhopes: but what does he hope?\"\n\n\"God knows!\" said Tom Austin.\n\n\"Poor Robert!\" replied Paganel, wiping his eyes.\n\nTrees thronged the valley in great numbers. The major chose a group of\nlofty carob-trees, under which was established a temporary encampment.\nA few blankets, the arms, a little dried meat, and some rice, was\nall that remained to the travelers. A stream, which flowed not far\noff, furnished water, still muddy from the effects of the avalanche.\nMulready kindled a fire on the grass, and soon presented to his master\na warm and comforting repast. But Glenarvan refused it, and remained\nstretched on his poncho in profound prostration.\n\nThus the day passed. Night came, clear and calm as the preceding. While\nhis companions lay motionless, although wakeful, Glenarvan reascended\nthe mountain. He listened closely, still hoping that a last cry might\nreach him. He ventured alone and afar, pressing his ear to the ground,\nlistening, restraining the beatings of his heart, and calling in a\nvoice of despair.\n\nThe whole night long he wandered on the mountain. Sometimes Paganel,\nsometimes the major, followed him, ready to help him on the slippery\nsummits, or on the edge of the chasms, where his rashness led him. But\nhis last efforts were fruitless; and to the cry of \"Robert! Robert!\" a\nthousand times repeated, echo alone replied.\n\nDay dawned, and it was necessary to go in search of Glenarvan on\nthe mountain, and bring him in spite of his reluctance back to the\nencampment. His despair was terrible. Who would now dare to speak\nto him of departure, and propose leaving this fatal valley? But the\nprovisions were failing. They would soon meet the Argentine guides\nand horses to take them across the Pampas. To retrace their steps was\nmore difficult than to advance. Besides, the Atlantic was the place\nappointed to meet the Duncan. All these reasons did not permit a longer\ndelay, and it was for the interest of all that the hour for departure\nshould be no longer deferred.\n\nMacNabb attempted to draw Glenarvan from his grief.

No native was seen; only the\nsentinels guarded in turn at the door of their prison.\n\nBut on the third day the huts were opened. The savages, men, women,\nand children, to the number of several hundreds, assembled in the pah,\nsilent and calm. Kai-Koumou came out of his house, and, surrounded by\nthe principal warriors of his tribe, took his place on a mound several\nfeet high in the centre of the fortification. The crowd of natives\nformed a semicircle around him, and the whole assembly preserved\nabsolute silence.\n\nAt a sign from the chief, a warrior advanced towards the temple.\n\n\"Remember!\" said Lady Helena to her husband.\n\nGlenarvan clasped his wife to his heart. At this moment Mary Grant\napproached John Mangles.\n\n\"Lord and Lady Glenarvan,\" said she, \"I think that, if a wife can die\nby the hand of her husband to escape a degrading existence, a maiden\ncan likewise die by the hand of her lover. John (for I may tell you\nat this critical moment), have I not long been your betrothed in the\ndepths of your heart? May I rely upon you, dear John, as Lady Helena\ndoes upon Lord Glenarvan?\"\n\n\"Mary!\" cried the young captain, in terror. \"Ah! dear Mary----\"\n\nHe could not finish: the mat was raised, and the captives were dragged\ntowards Kai-Koumou. The two women were resigned to their fate, while\nthe men concealed their anguish beneath a calmness that showed\nsuperhuman self-control. They came before the chief, who did not delay\nsentence.\n\n\"You killed Kara-Tété!\" said he to Glenarvan.\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n[Sidenote: THE BEGINNING OF THE END.]\n\n\"You shall die to-morrow at sunrise.\"\n\n\"Alone?\" inquired Glenarvan, whose heart beat quickly.\n\n\"What! as if our Tohonga's life were not more precious than yours!\"\ncried Kai-Koumou, whose eyes expressed a fierce regret.\n\nAt this moment a commotion took place among the natives. Glenarvan cast\na rapid glance around him. The crowd opened, and a warrior, dripping\nwith sweat and overcome with fatigue, appeared.\n\nAs soon as Kai-Koumou perceived him, he said in English, evidently that\nhe might be understood by the captives:\n\n\"You come from the camp of the pale-faces?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the Maori.\n\n\"You saw the prisoner, our Tohonga?\"\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n\"Is he living?\"\n\n\"He is dead! The English have shot him.\"\n\nThe fate of Glenarvan and his companions was settled.\n\n\"You shall all die to-morrow at daybreak!\" cried Kai-Koumou.\n\nThe unfortunates were therefore to suffer a common death. Lady Helena\nand Mary Grant raised towards heaven a look of thankfulness.\n\nThe captives were not taken back to the temple. They were to attend\nthat day the funeral of the dead chief, and the bloody ceremonies\nconnected therewith. A party of natives conducted them to the foot of\nan enormous koudi, where these guardians remained without losing sight\nof their prisoners. The rest of the tribe, absorbed in their official\nmourning, seemed to have forgotten them.\n\nThe customary three days had elapsed since the death of Kara-Tété. The\nsoul of the deceased had therefore forever abandoned its mortal abode.\nThe sacred rites began.\n\nThe body was carried to a small mound in the centre of the\nfortification, clothed in splendid costume, and enveloped in a\nmagnificent flaxen mat. The head was adorned with plumes, and wore a\ncrown of green leaves. The face, arms, and breast had been rubbed with\noil, and therefore showed no mortification.\n\nThe parents and friends of the deceased came to the foot of the\nmound, and all at once, as if some director were beating time to a\nfuneral dirge, a great concert of cries, groans, and sobs arose on the\nair. They mourned the dead in plaintive and modulated cadences. His\nrelations struck their heads together; his kinswomen lacerated their\nfaces with their nails, and showed themselves more lavish of blood than\nof tears. These unfortunate females conscientiously fulfilled their\nbarbarous duty.\n\nBut these demonstrations were not enough to appease the soul of the\ndeceased, whose wrath would doubtless hav"}, {"chunk_id": 190, "text": "des,\nfifteen feet high. A second line of stakes, and then a fence of osiers,\npierced with loop-holes, inclosed the inner space, the court-yard of\nthe pah, in which stood several Maori tents, and forty huts which were\nsymmetrically arranged.\n\nOn their arrival, the captives were terribly impressed at sight of\nthe heads that ornamented the stakes of the second inclosure. Lady\nHelena and Mary Grant turned away their eyes with more of disgust than\nterror. These heads had most of them belonged to hostile chiefs, fallen\nin battle, whose bodies had served as food for the conquerors. The\ngeographer knew them to be such by their hollow and eyeless sockets!\n\nIn Kai-Koumou's pah only the heads of his enemies formed this frightful\nmuseum; and here, doubtless, more than one English skull had served to\nincrease the size of the chief's collection.\n\nHis hut, among those belonging to warriors of lower rank, stood at the\nrear of the pah, in front of a large open terrace. This structure was\nbuilt of stakes, interlaced with branches, and lined inside with flax\nmatting.\n\nOnly one opening gave access to the dwelling. A thick curtain, made\nof a vegetable tissue, served as a door. The roof projected so as to\nform a water-shed. Several faces, carved at the ends of the rafters,\nadorned the hut, and the curtain was covered with various imitations\nof foliage, symbolical figures, monsters, and graceful sculpturing,\na curious piece of work, fashioned by the scissors of the native\ndecorators.\n\n[Sidenote: FEMININE ORATORY.]\n\nInside of the habitation the floor was made of hard-trodden earth,\nand raised six inches above the ground. Several rush screens and some\nmattresses, covered with woven matting of long leaves and twigs,\nserved as beds. In the middle of the room a hole in a stone formed the\nfireplace, and another in the roof answered for a chimney.\n\nThe smoke, when it became sufficiently thick, perforce escaped at this\noutlet, but it of course blackened the walls of the house.\n\nOn one side of the hut were storehouses, containing the chief's\nprovisions, his harvest of flax, potatoes, and edible ferns, and\nthe ovens where the various articles of food were cooked by contact\nwith heated stones. Farther off, in small pens, pigs and goats were\nconfined, and dogs ran about seeking their scanty sustenance. They were\nrather poorly kept, for animals that formed the Maori daily food.\n\nGlenarvan and his companions had taken in the whole at a glance. They\nawaited beside an empty hut the good pleasure of the chief, exposed to\nthe insults of a crowd of old women, who surrounded them like harpies,\nand threatened them with their fists, crying and howling. Several\nEnglish words that passed their lips clearly indicated that they were\ndemanding immediate vengeance.\n\nIn the midst of these cries and threats, Lady Helena affected a\ncalmness that she could not feel in her heart. This courageous woman,\nin order that her husband's coolness might not forsake him, heroically\ncontrolled her emotions. Poor Mary Grant felt herself growing weak, and\nCaptain Mangles supported her, ready to die in her defence. The others\nendured this torrent of invectives in various ways, either indifferent\nlike the major, or increasingly annoyed like Paganel.\n\nGlenarvan, wishing to relieve Lady Helena from the assaults of these\nshrews, boldly approached Kai-Koumou, and, pointing to the hideous\nthrong, said:\n\n\"Drive them away!\"\n\nThe Maori chief gazed steadily at his prisoner without replying. Then\nwith a gesture he silenced the noisy horde. Glenarvan bowed in token of\nthanks, and slowly resumed his place among his friends.\n\nKai-Koumou, fearing an insurrection of the fanatics of his tribe, now\nled his captives to a sacred place, situated at the other end of the\npah, on the edge of a precipice. This hut rested against a rock that\nrose a hundred feet above it and was a steep boundary to this side of\nthe fortification. In this consecrated temple the priests, or \"arikis,\"\ninstruct the New Zealanders. The buildin"}, {"chunk_id": 79, "text": "ings like\nsky-lights, and made it well ventilated and cool. At sight of these\nbranches rising in innumerable ramifications towards the clouds, while\nthe parasitic convolvuli bound them to each other, and the rays of the\nsun shone through the interstices of the leaves, you would really have\nthought that the trunk of this ombu bore upon itself alone an entire\nforest.\n\nOn the arrival of the fugitives, a feathered population flew away to\nthe top branches, protesting by their cries against so flagrant a\nusurpation of their dwelling. These birds, that had themselves sought\nrefuge upon this solitary ombu, were seen by hundreds,--blackbirds,\nstarlings, and many other richly-feathered varieties; and when they\nflew away it seemed as if a gust of wind had stripped the tree of its\nleaves.\n\nSuch was the asylum offered to Glenarvan's little party. Robert and the\nnimble Wilson were scarcely perched in the tree, before they hastened\nto climb to the topmost branches. Their heads protruded above the dome\nof verdure. From this lofty position the view embraced a wide range.\nThe ocean created by the inundation surrounded them on all sides,\nand their eyes could discern no limit. No other tree emerged from\nthe watery surface; the ombu, alone in the midst of the unconfined\nwaters, groaned at every shock. At a distance, borne along by the\nimpetuous current, floated uprooted trunks, twisted branches, thatch\ntorn from some demolished rancho, beams swept by the waters from the\nroofs of cattle-folds, bodies of drowned animals, bloody skins, and,\non a swaying tree, a whole family of growling jaguars that clung with\ntheir claws to this fragile raft. Still farther off, a black speck\nalmost invisible attracted Wilson's attention. It was Thalcave and his\nfaithful Thaouka, disappearing in the distance.\n\n[Illustration: He turned his intelligent head towards his master, and,\nshaking his long mane, neighed for him beseechingly.]\n\n[Sidenote: A COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY.]\n\n\"Thalcave, friend Thalcave!\" cried Robert, stretching out his hands\ntowards the courageous Patagonian.\n\n\"He will be saved, Mr. Robert,\" said Wilson; \"but let us join Lord\nGlenarvan.\"\n\nA moment after, Robert and the sailor descended the three stories\nof branches and found themselves among their companions. Glenarvan,\nPaganel, the major, Austin, and Mulready were seated astraddle, or\ndangling in the branches, according to their own inclinations. Wilson\ngave an account of their visit to the top of the tree. All shared his\nopinion in regard to Thalcave. The only question was, whether Thalcave\nwould save Thaouka, or Thaouka Thalcave.\n\nThe present situation of these refugees was undeniably insecure. The\ntree would not probably give way to the force of the current, but the\nrising waters might reach the top branches, for the depression of\nthe soil made this part of the plain a deep reservoir. Glenarvan's\nfirst care, therefore, was to establish, by means of notches, points\nof comparison which enabled him to note the different heights of the\nwater. The flood was now stationary, and it appeared to have reached\nits greatest elevation. This was encouraging.\n\n\"And now what shall we do?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"Build our nest, of course,\" replied Paganel.\n\n\"Build our nest!\" cried Robert.\n\n\"Certainly, my boy, and live the life of birds, since we cannot live\nthe life of fishes.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Glenarvan; \"but who will give us our beakful?\"\n\n\"I,\" replied the major.\n\nAll eyes were turned towards MacNabb, who was comfortably seated in a\nnatural arm-chair formed of two pliant branches, and with one hand was\nholding out the wet though well-filled saddle-bags.\n\n\"Ah, MacNabb,\" cried Glenarvan, \"this is just like you! You think of\neverything, even under circumstances where it is allowable to forget.\"\n\n\"As soon as it was decided not to be drowned, I concluded not to die of\nhunger.\"\n\n\"I should not have thought of this,\" said Paganel, innocently; \"but I\nam so absent-minded!\"\n\n\"And what do the saddle-bags contain?\" inquired Tom Aust"}]}

Besides, Glenarvan thought it likely that Kai-Koumou's tribe\nhad lost some chief of high rank whom they were particularly anxious to\nrecover; and he was not mistaken.\n\nThe next day the canoe ascended the river with increased swiftness.\nIt stopped for a moment at the junction of a small river which wound\nacross the plains on the right bank. Here another canoe, with ten\nnatives on board, joined Kai-Koumou. The warriors merely exchanged\nsalutations, and then continued their course. The new-comers had\nrecently fought against the English troops, as could be seen by their\ntattered garments, their gory weapons, and the wounds that still bled\nbeneath their rags. They were gloomy and taciturn, and, with the\nindifference common to all savage races, paid no attention to the\ncaptives.\n\nTowards evening Kai-Koumou landed at the foot of the mountains,\nwhose nearer ridges reached precipitously to the river-bank. Here\ntwenty natives, who had disembarked from their canoes, were making\npreparations for the night. Fires blazed beneath the trees. A chief,\nequal in rank to Kai-Koumou, advanced with measured pace, and, rubbing\nhis nose against that of the latter, saluted him cordially. The\nprisoners were stationed in the centre of the encampment, and guarded\nwith extreme vigilance.\n\nThe next morning the ascent of the Waikato was resumed. Other boats\ncame from various affluents of the river. Sixty warriors, evidently\nfugitives from the last insurrection, had now assembled, and were\nreturning, more or less wounded in the fray, to the mountain districts.\nSometimes a song arose from the canoes, as they advanced in single\nfile. One native struck up the patriotic ode of the mysterious \"Pihé,\"\nthe national hymn that calls the Maoris to battle. The full and\nsonorous voice of the singer waked the echoes of the mountains; and\nafter each stanza his comrades struck their breasts, and sang the\nwarlike verses in chorus. Then they seized their oars again, and the\ncanoes were headed up stream.\n\nDuring the day a singular sight enlivened the voyage. About four\no'clock the canoe, without lessening its speed, guided by the steady\nhand of the chief, dashed through a narrow gorge. Eddies broke\nviolently against numerous small islands, which rendered navigation\nexceeding dangerous. Never could it be more hazardous to capsize, for\nthe banks afforded no refuge, and whoever had set foot on the porous\ncrust of the shore would probably have perished. At this point the\nriver flowed between warm springs, oxide of iron colored the muddy\nground a brilliant red, and not a yard of firm earth could be seen.\nThe air was heavy with a penetrating sulphureous odor. The natives did\nnot regard it, but the captives were seriously annoyed by the noxious\nvapors exhaled from the fissures of the soil and the bubbles that\nburst and discharged their gaseous contents. Yet, however disagreeable\nthese emanations were, the eye could not but admire this magnificent\nspectacle.\n\n[Illustration: At this point the river flowed between warm springs, and\nnot a yard of firm earth could be seen.]\n\nThe canoes soon after entered a dense cloud of white smoke, whose\nwreaths rose in gradually decreasing circles above the river. On the\nshores a hundred geysers, some shooting forth masses of vapor, and\nothers overflowing in liquid columns, varied their effects, like the\njets and cascades of a fountain. It seemed as though some engineer was\ndirecting at his pleasure the outflowings of these springs, as the\nwaters and vapor, mingling in the air, formed rainbows in the sunbeams.\n\nFor two miles the canoes glided within this vapory atmosphere,\nenveloped in its warm waves that rolled along the surface of the water.\nThen the sulphureous smoke disappeared, and a pure swift current of\nfresh air refreshed the panting voyagers. The region of the springs was\npassed.

He allowed this bloody orgy an hour to reach its utmost\nintensity. The last act of the funeral was played with the usual rites.\n\nThe bodies of Kara-Tété and his wife were taken up, and their limbs\nbent and gathered against the stomach, according to the New Zealand\ncustom. The place for the tomb had been chosen outside of the\nfortification, about two miles distant, on the summit of a small\nmountain, called Maunganamu, situated on the right shore of the lake.\n\nThither the bodies were to be carried. Two very rude palanquins, or\nrather litters, were brought to the foot of the mound. The corpses,\nfolded together, in a sitting posture, and tied in their clothes by a\ngirdle of withes, were placed on this primitive bier. Four warriors\nbore it between them, and the entire tribe, chanting the funeral hymn,\nfollowed them in procession to the place of burial.\n\nThe captives, who were always watched, saw them leave the inner\ninclosure of the pah, and then the songs and cries gradually died away.\nFor about half an hour this funeral escort continued in sight, in the\ndepths of the valley. Finally they perceived it again winding along\nthe mountain paths. The distance gave a fantastic appearance to the\nundulating movements of the long, sinuous column.\n\nThe tribe stopped at the summit of the mountain, which was eight\nhundred feet high, at the place prepared for Kara-Tété's interment.\nA common Maori would have had only a hole and a heap of stones for a\ngrave; but for a powerful and dreaded chief, destined doubtless for a\nspeedy deification, a tomb worthy of his exploits was reserved.\n\n[Sidenote: THE LAST NIGHT.]\n\nThe sepulchre had been surrounded by palisades, while stakes,\nornamented with faces reddened with ochre, stood beside the grave\nwhere the bodies were to lie. The relatives had not forgotten that the\n\"waidoua\" (the spirit of the dead) feeds on substantial nourishment\nlike the body during this perishable life. Food had therefore been\ndeposited in the inclosure, together with the weapons and clothes of\nthe deceased.\n\nNothing was wanting for the comfort of the tomb. Husband and wife were\nlaid side by side, and then covered with earth and grass after a series\nof renewed lamentations. Then the procession silently descended the\nmountain, and now no one could ascend it under penalty of death, for it\nwas tabooed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LI.\n\nSTRANGELY LIBERATED.\n\n\nJust as the sun was disappearing behind Lake Taupo, the captives were\nled back to their prison. They were not to leave it again until the\nsummit of the Wahiti mountains should kindle with the first beams of\nthe day. One night remained to prepare for death. In spite of the\nfaintness, in spite of the horror with which they were seized, they\nshared their repast in common.\n\n\"We shall need all the strength possible to face death,\" said\nGlenarvan. \"We must show these barbarians how Europeans and Christians\ncan die.\"\n\nThe meal being finished, Lady Helena repeated the evening prayer aloud,\nwhile all her companions, with uncovered heads, joined her. Having\nfulfilled this duty, and enjoyed this privilege, the prisoners embraced\neach other. Lady Helena and Mary Grant then retired to one corner of\nthe hut, and stretched themselves upon a mat. Sleep, which soothes all\nwoes, soon closed their eyes, and they slumbered in each other's arms,\novercome by fatigue and long wakefulness.\n\nGlenarvan, taking his friends aside, said:\n\n\"My dear companions, our lives and those of these poor ladies are in\nGod's hands. If Heaven has decreed that we shall die to-morrow, we can,\nI am sure, die like brave people, like Christians, ready to appear\nfearlessly before the final Judge. God, who does read the secrets of\nthe soul, knows tha"}, {"chunk_id": 61, "text": ".]\n\nGlenarvan had conceived this idea because the banks of the Guamini\nseemed to be the haunt of the game of the surrounding plains.\n\"Tinamous,\" a kind of partridge, plovers called \"teru-teru,\" yellow\nrails, and water-fowl of magnificent green were seen rising in flocks.\nAs for quadrupeds, they did not make their appearance; but Thalcave,\npointing to the tall grass and thick coppice, explained that they\nwere hidden there. The hunters had only to take a few steps to find\nthemselves in one of the best game-coverts in the world.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThey began to hunt, therefore, and, disdaining the feathered tribe,\ntheir first attempts were made upon the large game of the Pampas. Soon\nhares and guanacos, like those that had attacked them so violently on\nthe Andes, started up before them by hundreds; but these very timid\nanimals fled with such swiftness that it was impossible to come within\ngun-shot. The hunters, therefore, attacked other game that was less\nfleet. A dozen partridges and rails were brought down, and Glenarvan\nshot a peccary, which was very good eating.\n\nIn less than half an hour they had obtained without difficulty all the\ngame they needed. Robert captured a curious animal called an armadillo,\nwhich was covered with a sort of helmet of movable bony pieces and\nmeasured a foot and a half in length. It was very fat, and would be an\nexcellent dish, as the Patagonian said; while Robert was proud of his\nsuccess.\n\nAs for Thalcave, he showed his companions a \"nandou\" hunt. This bird,\npeculiar to the Pampas, is a kind of ostrich, whose swiftness is\nmarvelous.\n\nThe Indian did not try to decoy so nimble an animal, but urged his\nhorse to a gallop, straight towards the bird, so as to overtake it\nat once, for, if the first attack should fail, the nandou would soon\nfatigue both horse and rider with its giddy backward and forward\nmovements.\n\nThalcave, arriving at a proper distance, launched his \"bolas\" with a\nstrong hand, and so skillfully that they twisted about the legs of\nthe ostrich and paralyzed its efforts. In a few moments it lay on\nthe ground. The Indian soon captured his prize and contributed it\nto the common repast. The string of partridges, Thalcave's ostrich,\nGlenarvan's peccary, and Robert's armadillo were brought back to camp.\nThe ostrich and the peccary were immediately stripped of their skin\nand cut into small slices. As for the armadillo, it is a dainty animal\nwhich carries its roasting dish with it, and it was, accordingly,\nplaced in its own bony covering on the glowing embers.\n\nThe three hunters were satisfied with the partridges for supper, and\nkept the rounds of beef for their friends. This repast was washed down\nwith clear water, which was then considered superior to all the wines\nin the world.\n\nThe horses were not forgotten. A great quantity of dry fodder, piled in\nthe ramada, served them for food and bedding.\n\n[Sidenote: DESERT SILENCE.]\n\nWhen everything was ready, Glenarvan, Robert, and the Indian wrapped\nthemselves in their ponchos, and stretched their limbs on a bundle of\nalfafares, the usual bed of the hunters of the Pampas.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\nTHE RED WOLVES.\n\n\nNight came,--the night of the new moon, only the uncertain light of\nthe stars illumined the plain. On the horizon the zodiacal light faded\naway in a dark mist. The waters of the Guamini flowed without a murmur,\nwhile birds, quadrupeds, and reptiles reposed after the fatigues of\nthe day. The silence of the desert reigned on the vast expanse of the\nPampas.\n\nGlenarvan, Robert, and Thalcave had yielded to the common law, and,\nstretched on their thick beds of grass, they enjoyed a refreshing\nsleep. The horses, overcome with fatigue, had lain down on the ground:\nThaouka alone, like a true blooded horse, slept standing, spirited in\nrepose as in action, and ready to start at the least sign from his\nmaster. Perfect tranquillity reigned within the inclosure, and the\nembers of the night-fire, as they gradually died out, cast their last\nrays over the silent obsc"}, {"chunk_id": 45, "text": "han two minutes.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said MacNabb; \"and was Robert on your right, or on your left?\"\n\n\"On my left. I remember that his poncho flapped in my face.\"\n\n\"And where were you situated in reference to us?\"\n\n\"On the left also.\"\n\n\"Then Robert could have disappeared only on this side,\" said the major,\nturning towards the mountain, and pointing to the right. \"And also\nconsidering the time that has elapsed since his disappearance, the\nchild must have fallen at a high part of the mountain. There we must\nsearch, and, by taking different ways, we shall find him.\"\n\nNot a word more was said. The six men, scaling the declivities of the\nmountain, stationed themselves at different heights along the ridge,\nand began their search. They kept always to the right of their line of\ndescent, sounding the smallest fissures, descending to the bottom of\nprecipices half filled with fragments of the mass; and more than one\ncame forth with his garments in shreds, his feet and hands lacerated,\nat the peril of his life.\n\n[Sidenote: A SLEEPLESS NIGHT.]\n\nAll this portion of the Andes, except a few inaccessible plateaus,\nwas carefully explored for many hours without one of these brave men\nthinking of rest. But it was a vain search. The child had not only\nfound death in the mountains, but also a tomb, the stone of which,\nmade of some enormous rock, was forever closed over him.\n\nTowards noon Glenarvan and his companions, bruised and exhausted, found\nthemselves again in the valley. The former was a prey to the most\nviolent grief. He scarcely spoke, and from his lips issued only these\nwords, broken by sighs,--\"I will not go; I will not go!\"\n\nEach understood this determination, and respected it.\n\n\"We will wait,\" said Paganel to the major and Tom Austin. \"Let us take\nsome rest, and recruit our strength. We shall need it, whether to begin\nour search or continue our journey.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied MacNabb, \"let us remain, since Edward wishes it. He\nhopes: but what does he hope?\"\n\n\"God knows!\" said Tom Austin.\n\n\"Poor Robert!\" replied Paganel, wiping his eyes.\n\nTrees thronged the valley in great numbers. The major chose a group of\nlofty carob-trees, under which was established a temporary encampment.\nA few blankets, the arms, a little dried meat, and some rice, was\nall that remained to the travelers. A stream, which flowed not far\noff, furnished water, still muddy from the effects of the avalanche.\nMulready kindled a fire on the grass, and soon presented to his master\na warm and comforting repast. But Glenarvan refused it, and remained\nstretched on his poncho in profound prostration.\n\nThus the day passed. Night came, clear and calm as the preceding. While\nhis companions lay motionless, although wakeful, Glenarvan reascended\nthe mountain. He listened closely, still hoping that a last cry might\nreach him. He ventured alone and afar, pressing his ear to the ground,\nlistening, restraining the beatings of his heart, and calling in a\nvoice of despair.\n\nThe whole night long he wandered on the mountain. Sometimes Paganel,\nsometimes the major, followed him, ready to help him on the slippery\nsummits, or on the edge of the chasms, where his rashness led him. But\nhis last efforts were fruitless; and to the cry of \"Robert! Robert!\" a\nthousand times repeated, echo alone replied.\n\nDay dawned, and it was necessary to go in search of Glenarvan on\nthe mountain, and bring him in spite of his reluctance back to the\nencampment. His despair was terrible. Who would now dare to speak\nto him of departure, and propose leaving this fatal valley? But the\nprovisions were failing. They would soon meet the Argentine guides\nand horses to take them across the Pampas. To retrace their steps was\nmore difficult than to advance. Besides, the Atlantic was the place\nappointed to meet the Duncan. All these reasons did not permit a longer\ndelay, and it was for the interest of all that the hour for departure\nshould be no longer deferred.\n\nMacNabb attempted to draw Glenarvan from his grief. For a long time he\nspoke wit"}, {"chunk_id": 193, "text": "\"\ncried he.]\n\nAt last his voice rose above the tumult.\n\n\"Taboo! taboo!\" cried he.\n\nAt this word the crowd fell back before Glenarvan and his companions,\nthus temporarily preserved by a supernatural power. A few moments after\nthey were led back to the temple that served as their prison; but\nRobert Grant and Paganel were no longer with them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER L.\n\nTHE CHIEF'S FUNERAL.\n\n\nKai-Koumou, according to a custom quite ordinary in New Zealand, joined\nthe rank of priest to that of chief, and could, therefore, extend to\npersons or objects the superstitious protection of the taboo.\n\nThe taboo, which is common to the tribes of Polynesia, has the power\nto prohibit at once all connection with the object or person tabooed.\nAccording to the Maori religion, whoever should lay his sacrilegious\nhand on what is declared taboo would be punished with death by the\noffended god; and in case the divinity should delay to avenge his own\ninsult, the priests would not fail to excite his anger.\n\nAs for the prisoners confined in the temple, the taboo had rescued\nthem from the fury of the tribe. Some of the natives, the friends and\npartisans of Kai-Koumou, had stopped suddenly at the command of their\nchief, and had protected the captives.\n\n[Sidenote: THE TORTURES OF SUSPENSE.]\n\nGlenarvan, however, was not blind to the fate that was reserved for\nhim. Only his death could atone for the murder of a chief. Among savage\nraces death is always preceded by a protracted torture. He therefore\nexpected to cruelly expiate the righteous indignation that had nerved\nhis arm, but hoped that Kai-Koumou's rage would fall only on himself.\n\nWhat a night he and his companions passed! Who could depict their\nanguish, or measure their sufferings? Neither poor Robert nor brave\nPaganel had reappeared. But how could they doubt their fate? Were they\nnot the first victims of the natives' vengeance? All hope had vanished\neven from the heart of the major, who did not easily despair. John\nMangles felt himself growing mad at sight of the sad dejection of Mary\nGrant, thus separated from her brother. Glenarvan thought of that\nterrible request of Lady Helena, who, rather than yield to torture or\nslavery, preferred to die by his hand. Could he summon this fearful\ncourage? As for an escape, that was plainly impossible. Ten warriors,\narmed to the teeth, guarded the entrance of the temple.\n\nMorning came at last. There had been no communication between the\nnatives and the prisoners. The hut contained a considerable quantity\nof food, which the unfortunates scarcely touched. Hunger gave place to\ngrief. The day passed without bringing a change or a hope. Doubtless\nthe hour for the dead chief's funeral and their torture would be the\nsame.\n\nHowever, although Glenarvan concluded that Kai-Koumou must have\nabandoned all idea of exchange, the major on this point retained a\ngleam of hope.\n\n\"Who knows,\" said he, reminding Glenarvan of the effect produced upon\nthe chief by the death of Kara-Tété,--\"who knows but that Kai-Koumou in\nreality feels obliged to you?\"\n\nBut, in spite of these observations, Glenarvan would no longer hope.\nThe next day also passed away without the preparations for torture\nbeing made. The reason of the delay was this.\n\nThe Maoris believe that the soul, for three days after death, inhabits\nthe body of the deceased, and therefore during this time the corpse\nremains unburied. This custom was rigorously observed, and for two days\nthe pah was deserted. Captain Mangles frequently stood on Wilson's\nshoulders and surveyed the fortification. No native was seen; only the\nsentinels guarded in turn at the door of their prison.\n\nBut on the third day the huts were opened. The savages, men, women,\nand children, to the number of several hundreds, assembled in the pah,\nsilent and calm. Kai-Koumou came out of his house, and, surrounded by\nthe principal warriors of his tribe, took his place on a mound several\nfeet high in the centre of the fortification. The crowd of natives\nformed a semicircle aroun"}]}

What,\nmoreover, could ten defenceless men do against thirty well-armed\nsavages? Besides, Glenarvan thought it likely that Kai-Koumou's tribe\nhad lost some chief of high rank whom they were particularly anxious to\nrecover; and he was not mistaken.\n\nThe next day the canoe ascended the river with increased swiftness.\nIt stopped for a moment at the junction of a small river which wound\nacross the plains on the right bank. Here another canoe, with ten\nnatives on board, joined Kai-Koumou. The warriors merely exchanged\nsalutations, and then continued their course. The new-comers had\nrecently fought against the English troops, as could be seen by their\ntattered garments, their gory weapons, and the wounds that still bled\nbeneath their rags. They were gloomy and taciturn, and, with the\nindifference common to all savage races, paid no attention to the\ncaptives.\n\nTowards evening Kai-Koumou landed at the foot of the mountains,\nwhose nearer ridges reached precipitously to the river-bank. Here\ntwenty natives, who had disembarked from their canoes, were making\npreparations for the night. Fires blazed beneath the trees. A chief,\nequal in rank to Kai-Koumou, advanced with measured pace, and, rubbing\nhis nose against that of the latter, saluted him cordially. The\nprisoners were stationed in the centre of the encampment, and guarded\nwith extreme vigilance.\n\nThe next morning the ascent of the Waikato was resumed. Other boats\ncame from various affluents of the river. Sixty warriors, evidently\nfugitives from the last insurrection, had now assembled, and were\nreturning, more or less wounded in the fray, to the mountain districts.\nSometimes a song arose from the canoes, as they advanced in single\nfile. One native struck up the patriotic ode of the mysterious \"Pihé,\"\nthe national hymn that calls the Maoris to battle. The full and\nsonorous voice of the singer waked the echoes of the mountains; and\nafter each stanza his comrades struck their breasts, and sang the\nwarlike verses in chorus. Then they seized their oars again, and the\ncanoes were headed up stream.\n\nDuring the day a singular sight enlivened the voyage. About four\no'clock the canoe, without lessening its speed, guided by the steady\nhand of the chief, dashed through a narrow gorge. Eddies broke\nviolently against numerous small islands, which rendered navigation\nexceeding dangerous. Never could it be more hazardous to capsize, for\nthe banks afforded no refuge, and whoever had set foot on the porous\ncrust of the shore would probably have perished. At this point the\nriver flowed between warm springs, oxide of iron colored the muddy\nground a brilliant red, and not a yard of firm earth could be seen.\nThe air was heavy with a penetrating sulphureous odor. The natives did\nnot regard it, but the captives were seriously annoyed by the noxious\nvapors exhaled from the fissures of the soil and the bubbles that\nburst and discharged their gaseous contents. Yet, however disagreeable\nthese emanations were, the eye could not but admire this magnificent\nspectacle.\n\n[Illustration: At this point the river flowed between warm springs, and\nnot a yard of firm earth could be seen.]\n\nThe canoes soon after entered a dense cloud of white smoke, whose\nwreaths rose in gradually decreasing circles above the river. On the\nshores a hundred geysers, some shooting forth masses of vapor, and\nothers overflowing in liquid columns, varied their effects, like the\njets and cascades of a fountain. It seemed as though some engineer was\ndirecting at his pleasure the outflowings of these springs, as the\nwaters and vapor, mingling in the air, formed rainbows in the sunbeams.\n\nFor two miles the canoes glided within this vapory atmosphere,\nenveloped in its warm waves that rolled along the surface of the water.\nThen the sulphureous smoke disappeared, and a pure swift current of\nfresh air refreshed the panting voyagers. The region of the springs was\npassed. Before the cl"}, {"chunk_id": 216, "text": "ajor, greatly puzzled.\n\n\"Yes, Mr. MacNabb,\" replied Austin. \"I will soon bring it.\"\n\nHe accordingly repaired to his own cabin. While he was gone, they gazed\nat each other in silence, except the major, who, with his eye fixed\nupon Paganel, said, as he folded his arms:\n\n\"Indeed, I must confess, Paganel, that this is a little too much.\"\n\nAt this moment Austin returned. He held in his hand the letter written\nby Paganel, and signed by Glenarvan.\n\n\"Read it, my lord,\" said the old sailor.\n\nGlenarvan took the letter, and read:\n\n\"Order for Tom Austin to put to sea, and bring the Duncan to the\neastern coast of New Zealand.\"\n\n\"New Zealand?\" cried Paganel, starting.\n\nHe snatched the letter from Glenarvan's hands, rubbed his eyes,\nadjusted his spectacles to his nose, and read in his turn.\n\n\"New Zealand!\" repeated he, in an indescribable tone, while the letter\nslipped from his fingers.\n\nJust then he felt a hand fall upon his shoulder. He turned, and found\nhimself face to face with the major.\n\n[Sidenote: PAGANEL IN THE WITNESS-BOX.]\n\n\"Well, my good Paganel,\" said MacNabb, in a grave tone, \"it is\nfortunate that you did not send the Duncan to Cochin-China.\"\n\nThis sally finished the poor geographer. A fit of laughter seized the\nwhole crew. Paganel, as if mad, ran to and fro, holding his head in his\nhands, and tearing his hair. However, when he had recovered from his\nfrenzy, there was still another unavoidable question to answer.\n\n\"Now, Paganel,\" said Glenarvan, \"be candid. I acknowledge that your\nabsent-mindedness has been providential. To be sure, without you the\nDuncan would have fallen into the hands of the convicts; without you we\nshould have been recaptured by the Maoris. But do tell me, what strange\nassociation of ideas, what unnatural aberration, induced you to write\nNew Zealand instead of Australia?\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Paganel. \"It was----\"\n\nBut at that moment his eyes fell upon Robert and Mary Grant, and he\nstopped short, finally replying:\n\n\"Never mind, my dear Glenarvan. I am a madman, a fool, an incorrigible\nbeing, and shall die a most famous blunderer!\"\n\nThe affair was no longer discussed. The mystery of the Duncan's\npresence there was solved; and the travelers, so miraculously saved,\nthought only of revisiting their comfortable cabins and partaking of a\ngood breakfast.\n\nHowever, leaving Lady Helena, Mary Grant, the major, Paganel, and\nRobert to enter the saloon, Glenarvan and Captain Mangles retained Tom\nAustin with them. They wished to question him further.\n\n\"Now, Tom,\" said Glenarvan, \"let me know: did not this order to sail\nfor the coast of New Zealand seem strange to you?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord,\" replied Austin. \"I was very much surprised; but, as I\nam not in the habit of discussing the orders I receive, I obeyed. Could\nI act otherwise? If any accident had happened from not following your\ninstructions, should I not have been to blame? Would you have done\ndifferently, captain?\"\n\n\"No, Tom,\" answered Captain Mangles.\n\n\"But what did you think?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"I thought, my lord, that, in the cause of Captain Grant, it was\nnecessary to go wherever you directed me; that by some combination of\ncircumstances another vessel would take you to New Zealand, and that\nI was to wait for you on the eastern coast of the island. Moreover,\non leaving Melbourne, I kept my destination secret, and the crew did\nnot know it till we were out at sea and the shores of Australia had\ndisappeared from sight. But then an incident occurred that perplexed me\nvery much.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, Tom?\" inquired Glenarvan.\n\n\"I mean,\" he replied, \"that when the quartermaster, Ayrton, learned,\nthe day after our departure, the Duncan's destination----\"\n\n\"Ayrton!\" cried Glenarvan. \"Is he on board?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord.\"\n\n\"Ayrton here!\" repeated Glenarvan, glancing at Captain Mangles.\n\n\"Wonderful indeed!\" said the young captain.\n\nIn an instant, with the swiftness of lightning, Ayrton's conduct, his\nlong-contrived treachery, Glenarvan's wound, the attack upon Mulready,\ntheir suffer"}, {"chunk_id": 193, "text": "\"\ncried he.]\n\nAt last his voice rose above the tumult.\n\n\"Taboo! taboo!\" cried he.\n\nAt this word the crowd fell back before Glenarvan and his companions,\nthus temporarily preserved by a supernatural power.

The English have shot him.\"\n\nThe fate of Glenarvan and his companions was settled.\n\n\"You shall all die to-morrow at daybreak!\" cried Kai-Koumou.\n\nThe unfortunates were therefore to suffer a common death. Lady Helena\nand Mary Grant raised towards heaven a look of thankfulness.\n\nThe captives were not taken back to the temple. They were to attend\nthat day the funeral of the dead chief, and the bloody ceremonies\nconnected therewith. A party of natives conducted them to the foot of\nan enormous koudi, where these guardians remained without losing sight\nof their prisoners. The rest of the tribe, absorbed in their official\nmourning, seemed to have forgotten them.\n\nThe customary three days had elapsed since the death of Kara-Tété. The\nsoul of the deceased had therefore forever abandoned its mortal abode.\nThe sacred rites began.\n\nThe body was carried to a small mound in the centre of the\nfortification, clothed in splendid costume, and enveloped in a\nmagnificent flaxen mat. The head was adorned with plumes, and wore a\ncrown of green leaves. The face, arms, and breast had been rubbed with\noil, and therefore showed no mortification.\n\nThe parents and friends of the deceased came to the foot of the\nmound, and all at once, as if some director were beating time to a\nfuneral dirge, a great concert of cries, groans, and sobs arose on the\nair. They mourned the dead in plaintive and modulated cadences. His\nrelations struck their heads together; his kinswomen lacerated their\nfaces with their nails, and showed themselves more lavish of blood than\nof tears. These unfortunate females conscientiously fulfilled their\nbarbarous duty.\n\nBut these demonstrations were not enough to appease the soul of the\ndeceased, whose wrath would doubtless hav"}, {"chunk_id": 186, "text": "ome still suffering from recent wounds, stood in perfect immobility,\nenveloped in their flaxen mantles. Three dogs of wild appearance were\nstretched at their feet. The eight rowers seemed to be servants or\nslaves of the chief. They worked vigorously, and the boat ascended the\ncurrent of the Waikato with remarkable swiftness.\n\nIn the centre of this long canoe, with feet tied, but hands free, were\nten European prisoners clinging closely to each other. They were Lord\nGlenarvan and his companions.\n\n[Sidenote: A TESTING TIME.]\n\nThe evening before, the little party, led astray by the dense fog, had\nencamped in the midst of a numerous tribe of natives. About midnight,\nthe travelers, surprised in their sleep, were made prisoners and\ncarried on board the canoe. They had not yet been maltreated, but had\ntried in vain to resist. Their arms and ammunition were in the hands of\nthe savages, and their own bullets would have quickly stretched them on\nthe earth had they attempted to escape.\n\nThey were not long in learning, by the aid of a few English words which\nthe natives used, that, being driven back by the British troops, they\nwere returning, vanquished and weakened, to the regions of the upper\nWaikato. Their chief, after an obstinate resistance, in which he lost\nhis principal warriors, was now on his way to rouse again the river\ntribes. He was called Kai-Koumou, a terrible name, which signified\nin the native language \"he who eats the limbs of his enemy.\" He was\nbrave and bold, but his cruelty equaled his bravery. No pity could be\nexpected from him. His name was well known to the English soldiers, and\na price had been set upon his head by the governor of New Zealand.\n\nThis terrible catastrophe had come upon Glenarvan just as he was\nabout reaching the long-desired harbor of Auckland, whence he would\nhave returned to his native country. Yet, looking at his calm and\npassionless countenance, you could not have divined the depth of his\nanguish, for in his present critical situation he did not betray the\nextent of his misfortunes. He felt that he ought to set an example of\nfortitude to his wife and his companions, as being the husband and\nchief. Moreover, he was ready to die first for the common safety, if\ncircumstances should require it.\n\n[Sidenote: CHIEFS, CIVILIZED AND UNCIVILIZED.]\n\nHis companions were worthy of him; they shared his noble thoughts, and\ntheir calm and haughty appearance would scarcely have intimated that\nthey were being carried away to captivity and suffering. By common\nconsent, at Glenarvan's suggestion, they had resolved to feign a proud\nindifference in the presence of the savages. It was the only way of\ninfluencing those fierce natures.\n\n[Illustration: A boat might have been seen ascending the Waikato. It\nwas a canoe seventy feet long and five broad.]\n\nSince leaving the encampment, the natives, taciturn like all savages,\nhad scarcely spoken to each other. However, from a few words exchanged,\nGlenarvan perceived that they were acquainted with the English\nlanguage. He therefore resolved to question the chief in regard to the\nfate that was in store for them. Addressing Kai-Koumou, he said, in a\nfearless tone:\n\n\"Where are you taking us, chief?\"\n\nKai-Koumou gazed at him coldly without answering.\n\n\"Say, what do you expect to do with us?\" continued Glenarvan.\n\nThe chief's eyes blazed with a sudden light, and in a stern voice he\nreplied:\n\n\"To exchange you, if your friends will ransom you; to kill you, if they\nrefuse.\"\n\nGlenarvan asked no more, but hope returned to his heart. Doubtless,\nsome chiefs of the Maori tribe had fallen into the hands of the\nEnglish, and the natives would attempt to recover them by way of\nexchange; their situation, therefore, was not one for despair.\n\nMeantime the canoe rapidly ascended the river. Paganel, whose\nchangeable disposition carried him from one extreme to another, had\nregained his hopefulness. He believed that the Maoris were sparing them\nthe fatigue of their journey to the English settlements, a"}]}

What,\nmoreover, could ten defenceless men do against thirty well-armed\nsavages? Besides, Glenarvan thought it likely that Kai-Koumou's tribe\nhad lost some chief of high rank whom they were particularly anxious to\nrecover; and he was not mistaken.\n\nThe next day the canoe ascended the river with increased swiftness.\nIt stopped for a moment at the junction of a small river which wound\nacross the plains on the right bank. Here another canoe, with ten\nnatives on board, joined Kai-Koumou. The warriors merely exchanged\nsalutations, and then continued their course. The new-comers had\nrecently fought against the English troops, as could be seen by their\ntattered garments, their gory weapons, and the wounds that still bled\nbeneath their rags. They were gloomy and taciturn, and, with the\nindifference common to all savage races, paid no attention to the\ncaptives.\n\nTowards evening Kai-Koumou landed at the foot of the mountains,\nwhose nearer ridges reached precipitously to the river-bank. Here\ntwenty natives, who had disembarked from their canoes, were making\npreparations for the night. Fires blazed beneath the trees. A chief,\nequal in rank to Kai-Koumou, advanced with measured pace, and, rubbing\nhis nose against that of the latter, saluted him cordially. The\nprisoners were stationed in the centre of the encampment, and guarded\nwith extreme vigilance.\n\nThe next morning the ascent of the Waikato was resumed. Other boats\ncame from various affluents of the river. Sixty warriors, evidently\nfugitives from the last insurrection, had now assembled, and were\nreturning, more or less wounded in the fray, to the mountain districts.\nSometimes a song arose from the canoes, as they advanced in single\nfile. One native struck up the patriotic ode of the mysterious \"Pihé,\"\nthe national hymn that calls the Maoris to battle. The full and\nsonorous voice of the singer waked the echoes of the mountains; and\nafter each stanza his comrades struck their breasts, and sang the\nwarlike verses in chorus. Then they seized their oars again, and the\ncanoes were headed up stream.\n\nDuring the day a singular sight enlivened the voyage. About four\no'clock the canoe, without lessening its speed, guided by the steady\nhand of the chief, dashed through a narrow gorge. Eddies broke\nviolently against numerous small islands, which rendered navigation\nexceeding dangerous. Never could it be more hazardous to capsize, for\nthe banks afforded no refuge, and whoever had set foot on the porous\ncrust of the shore would probably have perished. At this point the\nriver flowed between warm springs, oxide of iron colored the muddy\nground a brilliant red, and not a yard of firm earth could be seen.\nThe air was heavy with a penetrating sulphureous odor. The natives did\nnot regard it, but the captives were seriously annoyed by the noxious\nvapors exhaled from the fissures of the soil and the bubbles that\nburst and discharged their gaseous contents. Yet, however disagreeable\nthese emanations were, the eye could not but admire this magnificent\nspectacle.\n\n[Illustration: At this point the river flowed between warm springs, and\nnot a yard of firm earth could be seen.]\n\nThe canoes soon after entered a dense cloud of white smoke, whose\nwreaths rose in gradually decreasing circles above the river. On the\nshores a hundred geysers, some shooting forth masses of vapor, and\nothers overflowing in liquid columns, varied their effects, like the\njets and cascades of a fountain. It seemed as though some engineer was\ndirecting at his pleasure the outflowings of these springs, as the\nwaters and vapor, mingling in the air, formed rainbows in the sunbeams.\n\nFor two miles the canoes glided within this vapory atmosphere,\nenveloped in its warm waves that rolled along the surface of the water.\nThen the sulphureous smoke disappeared, and a pure swift current of\nfresh air refreshed the panting voyagers. The region of the springs was\npassed. Before the cl"}, {"chunk_id": 193, "text": "\"\ncried he.]\n\nAt last his voice rose above the tumult.\n\n\"Taboo! taboo!\" cried he.\n\nAt this word the crowd fell back before Glenarvan and his companions,\nthus temporarily preserved by a supernatural power. A few moments after\nthey were led back to the temple that served as their prison; but\nRobert Grant and Paganel were no longer with them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER L.\n\nTHE CHIEF'S FUNERAL.\n\n\nKai-Koumou, according to a custom quite ordinary in New Zealand, joined\nthe rank of priest to that of chief, and could, therefore, extend to\npersons or objects the superstitious protection of the taboo.\n\nThe taboo, which is common to the tribes of Polynesia, has the power\nto prohibit at once all connection with the object or person tabooed.\nAccording to the Maori religion, whoever should lay his sacrilegious\nhand on what is declared taboo would be punished with death by the\noffended god; and in case the divinity should delay to avenge his own\ninsult, the priests would not fail to excite his anger.\n\nAs for the prisoners confined in the temple, the taboo had rescued\nthem from the fury of the tribe. Some of the natives, the friends and\npartisans of Kai-Koumou, had stopped suddenly at the command of their\nchief, and had protected the captives.\n\n[Sidenote: THE TORTURES OF SUSPENSE.]\n\nGlenarvan, however, was not blind to the fate that was reserved for\nhim. Only his death could atone for the murder of a chief. Among savage\nraces death is always preceded by a protracted torture. He therefore\nexpected to cruelly expiate the righteous indignation that had nerved\nhis arm, but hoped that Kai-Koumou's rage would fall only on himself.\n\nWhat a night he and his companions passed! Who could depict their\nanguish, or measure their sufferings? Neither poor Robert nor brave\nPaganel had reappeared. But how could they doubt their fate? Were they\nnot the first victims of the natives' vengeance? All hope had vanished\neven from the heart of the major, who did not easily despair. John\nMangles felt himself growing mad at sight of the sad dejection of Mary\nGrant, thus separated from her brother. Glenarvan thought of that\nterrible request of Lady Helena, who, rather than yield to torture or\nslavery, preferred to die by his hand. Could he summon this fearful\ncourage? As for an escape, that was plainly impossible. Ten warriors,\narmed to the teeth, guarded the entrance of the temple.\n\nMorning came at last. There had been no communication between the\nnatives and the prisoners. The hut contained a considerable quantity\nof food, which the unfortunates scarcely touched. Hunger gave place to\ngrief. The day passed without bringing a change or a hope. Doubtless\nthe hour for the dead chief's funeral and their torture would be the\nsame.\n\nHowever, although Glenarvan concluded that Kai-Koumou must have\nabandoned all idea of exchange, the major on this point retained a\ngleam of hope.\n\n\"Who knows,\" said he, reminding Glenarvan of the effect produced upon\nthe chief by the death of Kara-Tété,--\"who knows but that Kai-Koumou in\nreality feels obliged to you?\"\n\nBut, in spite of these observations, Glenarvan would no longer hope.\nThe next day also passed away without the preparations for torture\nbeing made. The reason of the delay was this.\n\nThe Maoris believe that the soul, for three days after death, inhabits\nthe body of the deceased, and therefore during this time the corpse\nremains unburied. This custom was rigorously observed, and for two days\nthe pah was deserted. Captain Mangles frequently stood on Wilson's\nshoulders and surveyed the fortification. No native was seen; only the\nsentinels guarded in turn at the door of their prison.\n\nBut on the third day the huts were opened. The savages, men, women,\nand children, to the number of several hundreds, assembled in the pah,\nsilent and calm. Kai-Koumou came out of his house, and, surrounded by\nthe principal warriors of his tribe, took his place on a mound several\nfeet high in the centre of the fortification. The crowd of natives\nformed a semicircle aroun"}, {"chunk_id": 192, "text": "erful\ntribes of the Waikato with equal rank; and, during this interview,\nalthough Kai-Koumou smiled, his eyes betrayed a deep hostility.\n\nHe now questioned Glenarvan.\n\n\"You are English?\" said he.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Glenarvan, without hesitation, for this nationality\nwould probably facilitate an exchange.\n\n[Sidenote: THE RATE OF BARTER.]\n\n\"And your companions?\" asked Kai-Koumou.\n\n\"My companions are also English. We are shipwrecked travelers, and, if\nyou care to know, we have taken no part in the war.\"\n\n\"No matter,\" replied Kara-Tété, brutally. \"Every Englishman is our\nenemy. Your people have invaded our island. They have stolen away our\nfields; they have burned our villages.\"\n\n\"They have done wrong,\" said Glenarvan, in a grave tone. \"I say so\nbecause I think so, and not because I am in your power.\"\n\n\"Listen,\" continued Kai-Koumou. \"Tohonga, the high-priest of\nNouï-Atoua, has fallen into the hands of your brothers. He is prisoner\nof the Pakekas (Europeans). Our god commands us to ransom his life.\nI would have torn out your heart, I would have hung your companions'\nheads and yours forever to the stakes of this palisade. But Nouï-Atoua\nhas spoken.\"\n\nSo saying, Kai-Koumou, who had hitherto controlled himself, trembled\nwith rage, and his countenance was flushed with a fierce exultation.\nThen, after a few moments, he resumed, more coolly:\n\n\"Do you think the English will give us our Tohonga in exchange for you?\"\n\nGlenarvan hesitated, and watched the Maori chief very attentively.\n\n\"I do not know,\" said he, after a moment's silence.\n\n\"Speak,\" continued Kai-Koumou. \"Is your life worth that of our Tohonga?\"\n\n\"No,\" answered Glenarvan. \"I am neither a chief nor a priest among my\npeople.\"\n\nPaganel was astounded at this reply, and gazed at Glenarvan in profound\nwonder. Kai-Koumou seemed equally surprised.\n\n\"Then you doubt it?\" said he.\n\n\"I do not know,\" repeated Glenarvan.\n\n\"Will not your people accept you in exchange for our Tohonga?\"\n\n\"Not me alone,\" replied Glenarvan; \"but perhaps all of us.\"\n\n\"Among the Maoris,\" said Kai-Koumou, \"it is one for one.\"\n\n\"Offer these ladies first in exchange for your priest,\" answered\nGlenarvan, pointing to Lady Helena and Mary Grant. Lady Helena would\nhave rushed towards her husband, but the major restrained her.\n\n\"These two ladies,\" continued Glenarvan, turning respectfully towards\nthem, \"hold a high rank in their country.\"\n\nThe warrior glanced coldly at his prisoner. A malicious smile passed\nover his face; but he almost instantly repressed it, and replied, in a\nvoice which he could scarcely control:\n\n\"Do you hope, then, to deceive Kai-Koumou by false words, cursed\nEuropean? Do you think that Kai-Koumou's eyes cannot read your heart?\"\n\nThen, pointing to Lady Helena, he said:\n\n\"That is your wife!\"\n\n\"No, mine!\" cried Kara-Tété.\n\nThen, pushing back the prisoners, the chief laid his hand on Lady\nHelena's shoulder, who grew pale at the touch.\n\n\"Edward!\" cried the unfortunate woman, in terror.\n\nGlenarvan, without uttering a word, raised his arm. A report resounded.\nKara-Tété fell dead.\n\nAt this sound a crowd of natives issued from the huts. The pah was\nfilled in an instant. A hundred arms were raised against the captives.\nGlenarvan's revolver was snatched from his hand.\n\nKai-Koumou cast a strange look at Glenarvan, and then, guarding with\none hand the person of him who had fired, he controlled with the other\nthe throng that was rushing upon the Europeans.\n\n[Illustration: At last his voice rose above the tumult. \"Taboo! taboo!\"\ncried he.]\n\nAt last his voice rose above the tumult.\n\n\"Taboo! taboo!\" cried he.\n\nAt this word the crowd fell back before Glenarvan and his companions,\nthus temporarily preserved by a supernatural power.

Glenarvan bowed in token of\nthanks, and slowly resumed his place among his friends.\n\nKai-Koumou, fearing an insurrection of the fanatics of his tribe, now\nled his captives to a sacred place, situated at the other end of the\npah, on the edge of a precipice. This hut rested against a rock that\nrose a hundred feet above it and was a steep boundary to this side of\nthe fortification. In this consecrated temple the priests, or \"arikis,\"\ninstruct the New Zealanders. The building was spacious and tightly\nclosed, and contained the holy and chosen food of the god.\n\nHere the prisoners, temporarily sheltered from the fury of the natives,\nstretched themselves on the flax mats. Lady Helena, her strength\nexhausted and her energy overcome, sank into her husband's arms.\nGlenarvan pressed her to his breast, and said:\n\n\"Courage, my dear Helena; Heaven will not forsake us!\"\n\nRobert was scarcely within the hut before he climbed on Wilson's\nshoulders, and succeeded in thrusting his head through an opening\nbetween the roof and the wall, where strings of pipes were hanging.\nFrom this point his view commanded the whole extent of the pah, as far\nas Kai-Koumou's hut.\n\n\"They have gathered around the chief,\" said he, in a low voice. \"They\nare waving their arms, and howling. Kai-Koumou is going to speak.\"\n\nThe boy was silent for a few moments, then continued:\n\n\"Kai-Koumou is speaking. The savages grow calm; they listen.\"\n\n\"This chief,\" said the major, \"has evidently a personal interest in\nprotecting us. He wishes to exchange his prisoners for some chiefs of\nhis tribe. But will his warriors consent?\"\n\n\"Yes, they are listening to him,\" continued Robert. \"They are\ndispersing; some return to their huts,--others leave the fortification.\"\n\n\"Is it really so?\" cried the major.\n\n\"Yes, Mr. MacNabb,\" replied Robert. \"Kai-Koumou remains alone with the\nwarriors that were in the canoe. Ha! one of them is coming towards us!\"\n\n[Illustration: Robert was scarcely within the hut before he climbed\non Wilson's shoulders, and succeeded in thrusting his head through an\nopening.]\n\n\"Get down, Robert,\" said Glenarvan.\n\nAt this moment Lady Helena, who had risen, seized her husband's arm.\n\n\"Edward,\" said she, in a firm voice, \"neither Mary Grant nor I shall\nfall alive into the hands of those savages!\"\n\nAnd, so saying, she presented to her husband a loaded revolver.\n\n\"A weapon!\" exclaimed Glenarvan, whose eyes suddenly brightened.\n\n\"Yes. The Maoris do not search their female prisoners; but this weapon\nis for us, Edward, not for them.\"\n\n\"Glenarvan,\" said MacNabb quickly, \"hide the revolver. It is not time\nyet.\"\n\nThe weapon was immediately concealed in his clothes. The mat that\nclosed the entrance of the hut was raised. A native appeared. He made a\nsign to the captives to follow him. Glenarvan and his companions passed\nthrough the pah, and stopped before Kai-Koumou.\n\nAround him were assembled the principal warriors of his tribe, among\nwhom was seen the chief whose canoe had first joined Kai-Koumou on the\nriver. He was a man of about forty, robust, and of fierce and cruel\naspect. His name was Kara-Tété, which means in the native language\n\"The Irascible.\" Kai-Koumou treated him with some respect, and from\nthe delicacy of his tattooing it was evident that he occupied a high\nrank in his tribe. An observer, however, would have detected a rivalry\nbetween the two chiefs. The major, indeed, perceived that Kara-Tété's\ninfluence surpassed that of Kai-Koumou. They both ruled the powerful\ntribes of the Waikato with equal rank; and, during this interview,\nalthough Kai-Koumou smiled, his eyes betrayed a deep hostility.\n\nHe now questioned Glenarvan.\n\n\"You are English?\" said he.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Glenarvan, without hesitation, for this nationality\nwould probably facilitate an exchange.\n\n[Sidenote: THE RATE OF BARTER.]\n\n\"And your companions?\" asked Kai-Koumou.\n\n\"My companions are also English.

Look!\"\n\nAnd all saw, indeed, that an inexplicable change had taken place in the\nmovements of the Maoris. Their pursuit had been suddenly interrupted.\nTheir ascent of the mountain had ceased, as if by an imperious\ninterdict. The crowd of natives had checked their swiftness, and\nhalted, like the waves of the sea before an impassable rock.\n\nAll the savages, thirsting for blood, were now ranged along the foot\nof the mountain, yelling, gesticulating, and brandishing guns and\nhatchets; but they did not advance a single foot. Their dogs, like\nthemselves, as though chained to earth, howled with rage.\n\nWhat was the difficulty? What invisible power restrained the natives?\nThe fugitives gazed without comprehending, fearing that the charm that\nenchained Kai-Koumou's tribe would dissolve.\n\nSuddenly Captain Mangles uttered a cry that caused his companions to\nturn. He pointed to a little fortress at the summit of the peak.\n\n\"The tomb of the chief Kara-Tété!\" cried Robert.\n\n\"Are you in earnest?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"Yes, my lord, it is the tomb; I recognize it.\"\n\nRobert was right. Fifty feet above, at the extreme point of the\nmountain, stood a small palisaded inclosure of freshly-painted stakes.\nGlenarvan, likewise, recognized the sepulchre of the Maori chief. In\ntheir wanderings they had come to the top of the Maunganamu, where\nKara-Tété had been buried.\n\nFollowed by his companions, he climbed the sides of the peak, to the\nvery foot of the tomb. A large opening, covered with mats, formed the\nentrance. Glenarvan was about to enter, when, all at once, he started\nback suddenly.\n\n\"A savage!\" said he.\n\n\"A savage in this tomb?\" inquired the major.\n\n\"Yes, MacNabb.\"\n\n\"What matter? Let us enter.\"\n\nGlenarvan, the major, Robert, and Captain Mangles passed into the\ninclosure. A Maori was there, clad in a great flax mantle. The darkness\nof the sepulchre did not permit them to distinguish his features. He\nappeared very calm, and was eating his breakfast with the most perfect\nindifference.\n\nGlenarvan was about to address him, when the native, anticipating him,\nsaid, in an amiable tone, and in excellent English:\n\n\"Be seated, my dear lord; breakfast is awaiting you.\"\n\nIt was Paganel. At his voice all rushed into the tomb, and gazed with\nwonder at the worthy geographer. Paganel was found! The common safety\nwas represented in him. They were going to question him: they wished\nto know how and why he was on the top of the mountain; but Glenarvan\nchecked this unseasonable curiosity.\n\n[Illustration: \"Be seated, my dear lord; breakfast is awaiting you.\"]\n\n\"The savages!\" said he.\n\n\"The savages,\" replied Paganel, shrugging his shoulders, \"are\nindividuals whom I supremely despise.\"\n\n\"But can they not----?\"\n\n\"They! the imbeciles! Come and see them.\"\n\nEach followed Paganel, who issued from the tomb. The Maoris were in the\nsame place, surrounding the foot of the peak, and uttering terrible\ncries.\n\n\"Cry and howl till you are tired, miserable creatures!\" said Paganel.\n\"I defy you to climb this mountain!\"\n\n\"And why?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"Because the chief is buried here; this tomb protects us, and the\nmountain is tabooed.\"\n\n\"Tabooed?\"\n\n\"Yes, my friends; and that is why I took refuge here, as in one of\nthose asylums of the Middle Ages, open to unfortunates.\"\n\nIndeed, the mountain was tabooed, and by this consecration had become\ninaccessible by the superstitious savages.\n\nThe safety of the fugitives was not yet certain, but there was a\nsalutary respite, of which they strove to take advantage. Glenarvan, a\nprey to unspeakable emotion, did not venture a word; while the major\nnodded his head with an air of genuine satisfaction.\n\n\"And now, my friends,\" said Paganel, \"if these brutes expect us to test\ntheir patience they are mistaken.

It is impossible.\"\n\nHowever, he came on deck, and approached the stranger.\n\n\"Are you the steward of the vessel?\" the latter asked him.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Olbinett; \"but I have not the honor----\"\n\n\"I am the passenger of cabin number six.\"\n\n\"Number six?\" repeated the steward.\n\n\"Certainly; and your name is----?\"\n\n\"Olbinett.\"\n\n\"Well, Olbinett, my friend,\" answered the stranger of cabin number six,\n\"I must think of dinner, and acutely, too.

Is he asleep, too? Fortunately, the weather is beautiful, the\nwind favorable, and the ship goes on quite by herself----\"\n\nJust as he said this, Captain Mangles appeared at the companion-way.\n\n\"Here is the captain,\" said Olbinett.\n\n\"Ah, I am delighted,\" cried the stranger, \"delighted to make your\nacquaintance, Captain Burton!\"\n\nIf any one was ever astounded, John Mangles certainly was, not less at\nhearing himself called \"Captain Burton,\" than at seeing this stranger\non board his vessel.\n\nThe latter continued, with more animation:\n\n\"Permit me to shake hands with you, and if I did not do so day before\nyesterday, it was that no one might be embarrassed at the moment of\ndeparture. But to-day, captain, I am truly happy to meet you.\"\n\nCaptain Mangles opened his eyes in measureless astonishment, looking\nfirst at Olbinett, and then at the new comer.\n\n\"Now,\" continued the latter, \"the introduction is"}, {"chunk_id": 150, "text": "on a good\nfooting with your mate, and in six days I engage to bring the Duncan to\nTwofold Bay.\"\n\n\"Well said!\" replied Glenarvan. \"You are a brave and intelligent man,\nAyrton, and will succeed.\"\n\nThe quartermaster was evidently more capable than any one else of\nfulfilling this difficult mission. Captain Mangles raised one final\nobjection, that Ayrton's presence was necessary to enable them to\nfind traces of the Brittania or Captain Grant; but the major observed\nthat they should remain encamped on the banks of the Snowy till the\nmessenger's return, that it was not proposed to resume the search\nwithout him, and that consequently his absence could be in no way\nprejudicial to their interests.\n\n\"Well then, Ayrton, start,\" said Glenarvan. \"Make haste, and return to\nthe encampment by way of Eden.\"\n\nA gleam of satisfaction seemed to light up the eyes of the\nquartermaster. He turned his head to one side, though not so quickly\nbut that Captain Mangles had intercepted his glance, and instinctively\nfelt his suspicions increased.\n\nThe quartermaster made his preparations for departure, aided by the\ntwo sailors, one of whom attended to his horse, and the other to his\nprovisions. Meantime Glenarvan wrote the letter designed for Tom Austin.\n\nHe ordered the mate of the Duncan to repair without delay to Twofold\nBay, and recommended the quartermaster to him as a man in whom he could\nplace entire confidence. As soon as he arrived at the bay, he was to\nsend a detachment of sailors under the command of Ayrton.\n\nHe had just reached this part of his letter, when the major, who had\nbeen looking over his shoulder, asked him, in a singular tone, how he\nwrote the word Ayrton.\n\n\"As it is pronounced,\" replied Glenarvan.\n\n\"That is a mistake,\" said the major coolly. \"It is pronounced Ayrton,\nbut it is written 'Ben Joyce'!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLI.\n\nTHE PLOT UNVEILED.\n\n\nThe sound of the name of Ben Joyce fell upon the party like a\nthunderbolt. Ayrton suddenly sprang to his feet. In his hand was a\nrevolver. A report was heard; and Glenarvan fell, struck by a bullet.\n\nBefore Captain Mangles and the sailors recovered from the surprise into\nwhich this unexpected turn of affairs had thrown them, the audacious\nconvict had escaped, and joined his band, scattered along the edge of\nthe wood of gum-trees.\n\n[Illustration: A report was heard; and Glenarvan fell, struck by a\nbullet.]\n\nThe tent did not offer a sufficient shelter against the bullets, and\nit was clearly necessary to beat a retreat. Glenarvan, who was but\nslightly injured, had risen.\n\n\"To the cart! to the cart!\" cried Captain Mangles, as he hurried on\nLady Helena and Mary Grant, who were soon in safety behind its stout\nsides.\n\nThe captain, the major, Paganel, and the sailors then seized their\nrifles, and stood ready to repel the convicts. Glenarvan and Robert had\njoined the ladies, while Olbinett hastened to the common defence.\n\nThese events had transpired with the rapidity of lightning. Captain\nMangles attentively watched the edge of the wood; but the reports\nsuddenly ceased on the arrival of Ben Joyce, and a profound silence\nsucceeded the noisy fusillade. A few wreaths of white smoke were still\ncurling up between the branches of the gum-trees, but the tall tufts of\ngastrolobium were motionless and all signs of attack had disappeared.\n\nThe major and Captain Mangles extended their examinations as far as the\ngreat trees. The place was abandoned. Numerous footprints were seen,\nand a few half-burnt cartridges smoked on the ground. The major, like\na prudent man, extinguished them, for a spark was enough to kindle a\nformidable conflagration in this forest of dry trees.\n\n\"The convicts have disappeared,\" said Captain Mangles.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the major; \"and this disappearance alarms me. I should\nprefer to meet them face to face. It is better to encounter a tiger in\nthe open plain than a serpent in the grass. Let us search these bushes\naround the cart.\"\n\n[Sidenote: UNRAVELINGS.]\n\nThe major and captain scoured the surrounding c"}, {"chunk_id": 215, "text": "elers whom, three months before, hope had stimulated to\na search for the shipwrecked captain. Chance alone had led them back to\nthis vessel that they had ceased to regard as theirs, and in what a sad\nstate of exhaustion and feebleness!\n\nHowever, before thinking of fatigue, or the imperative calls of hunger\nand thirst, Glenarvan questioned Tom Austin concerning his presence in\nthese waters. Why was the Duncan on the eastern coast of New Zealand?\nWhy was she not in the hands of Ben Joyce? By what providential working\nhad God restored her to the fugitives? These were the questions that\nwere hurriedly addressed to Tom Austin. The old sailor did not know\nwhich to answer first. He therefore concluded to listen only to Lord\nGlenarvan, and reply to him.\n\n\"But the convicts?\" inquired Glenarvan. \"What have you done with the\nconvicts?\"\n\n\"The convicts!\" replied Tom Austin, like a man who is at a loss to\nunderstand a question.\n\n\"Yes; the wretches who attacked the yacht.\"\n\n\"What yacht, my lord? The Duncan?\"\n\n\"Of course. Did not Ben Joyce come on board?\"\n\n\"I do not know Ben Joyce; I have never seen him.\"\n\n\"Never?\" cried Glenarvan, amazed at the answers of the old sailor.\n\"Then will you tell me why the Duncan is now on the shores of New\nZealand?\"\n\n[Sidenote: MYSTERY MORE MYSTERIOUS!]\n\nAlthough Glenarvan and his friends did not at all understand Austin's\nastonishment, what was their surprise when he replied, in a calm voice:\n\n\"The Duncan is here by your lordship's orders.\"\n\n\"By my orders?\" cried Glenarvan.\n\n\"Yes, my lord. I only conformed to the instructions contained in your\nletter.\"\n\n\"My letter?\" exclaimed Glenarvan.\n\nThe ten travelers at once surrounded Tom Austin, and gazed at him in\neager curiosity. The letter written at the Snowy River had reached the\nDuncan.\n\n\"Well,\" continued Glenarvan, \"let us have an explanation; for I almost\nthink I am dreaming. You received a letter, Tom?\"\n\n\"Yes; a letter from your lordship.\"\n\n\"At Melbourne?\"\n\n\"At Melbourne; just as I had finished the repair of the ship.\"\n\n\"And this letter?\"\n\n\"It was not written by you; but it was signed by you, my lord.\"\n\n\"Exactly; it was sent by a convict, Ben Joyce.\"\n\n\"No; by the sailor called Ayrton, quartermaster of the Britannia.\"\n\n\"Yes, Ayrton or Ben Joyce; it is the same person. Well, what did the\nletter say?\"\n\n\"It ordered me to leave Melbourne without delay, and come to the\neastern shores of----\"\n\n\"Australia!\" cried Glenarvan, with an impetuosity that disconcerted the\nold sailor.\n\n\"Australia?\" repeated Tom, opening his eyes. \"No, indeed; New Zealand!\"\n\n\"Australia, Tom! Australia!\" replied Glenarvan's companions, with one\nvoice.\n\n[Illustration: As soon as they set foot on deck the bagpiper struck up\na well remembered air, while hearty hurrahs welcomed the owner's return\non board.]\n\nAustin was now bewildered. Glenarvan spoke with such assurance, that\nhe feared he had made a mistake in reading the letter. Could he,\nfaithful and accurate sailor that he was, have committed such a\nblunder? He began to feel troubled.\n\n[Illustration: This sally finished the poor geographer.]\n\n\n\"Be easy, Tom,\" said Lady Helena. \"Providence has decreed----\"\n\n\"No, madam, pardon me,\" returned the sailor; \"no, it is not possible! I\nam not mistaken. Ayrton also read the letter, and he, on the contrary,\nwished to go to Australia.\"\n\n\"Ayrton?\" cried Glenarvan.\n\n\"The very one. He maintained that it was a mistake, and that you had\nappointed Twofold Bay as the place of meeting.\"\n\n\"Have you the letter, Tom?\" asked the major, greatly puzzled.\n\n\"Yes, Mr. MacNabb,\" replied Austin. \"I will soon bring it.\"\n\nHe accordingly repaired to his own cabin. While he was gone, they gazed\nat each other in silence, except the major, who, with his eye fixed\nupon Paganel, said, as he folded his arms:\n\n\"Indeed, I must confess, Paganel, that this is a little too much.\"\n\nAt this moment Austin returned. He held in his hand the letter written\nby Paganel, and signed by Glenarvan.\n\n\"Read it, my lord,\" said the old sailor.\n\nGlenarvan to"}, {"chunk_id": 160, "text": "cry.\n\nMacNabb continued:\n\n[Sidenote: A HOPELESS CHANCE.]\n\n\"'Now, you others,' said Ben Joyce, 'catch the horse. In two days I\nshall be on board the Duncan, and in six at Twofold Bay. There is the\nplace of meeting. The lord's party will be still fast in the marshes\nof the Snowy. Cross the river at Kemple Pier bridge, go to the coast,\nand wait for me. I will find means to bring you on board. With the\ncrew once at sea, and a vessel like the Duncan, we shall be masters\nof the Indian Ocean.' 'Hurrah for Ben Joyce!' cried the convicts.\nMulready's horse was then led up, and Ben Joyce disappeared at a gallop\non the Lucknow road, while the band proceeded southeastward to the\nSnowy River. Mulready, although severely wounded, had strength to drag\nhimself within two hundred paces of the encampment, where we picked him\nup almost dead. This,\" added MacNabb, \"is Mulready's sad story. You\nunderstand now why the courageous sailor wished so much to speak.\"\n\nThis revelation terrified all.\n\n\"Pirates! pirates!\" cried Glenarvan. \"My crew massacred, my Duncan in\nthe hands of these bandits!\"\n\n\"Yes, for Ben Joyce will surprise the vessel,\" replied the major, \"and\nthen----\"\n\n\"Well, we must reach the coast before these wretches,\" said Paganel.\n\n\"But how cross the Snowy?\" asked Wilson.\n\n\"Like them,\" answered Glenarvan. \"They will cross Kemple Pier bridge,\nand we will do the same.\"\n\n\"But what will become of Mulready?\" inquired Lady Helena.\n\n\"We will take turns in carrying him. Shall I give up my defenceless\ncrew to Ben Joyce's band?\"\n\nThe plan of crossing Kemple Pier bridge was practicable, but perilous.\nThe convicts might locate themselves at this point to defend it. It\nwould be at least thirty against seven! But there are moments when we\ndo not think of these things, when we must advance at all hazards.\n\n\"My lord,\" said Captain Mangles, at length, \"before risking our\nlast chance, before venturing towards the bridge, it is prudent to\nreconnoitre it first. I will undertake this.\"\n\n\"I will accompany you, captain,\" replied Paganel.\n\n[Sidenote: THE BURNED BRIDGE.]\n\nThis proposal was accepted, and the captain and Paganel prepared to\nstart immediately. They were to follow along the bank of the river till\nthey came to the place indicated by Ben Joyce, and keep out of sight\nof the convicts, who were probably lying in wait. These two courageous\nmen accordingly, well furnished with arms and provisions, set out, and\nsoon disappeared among the tall rushes of the river.\n\n[Illustration: The animal reared. Mulready seized his revolver and\nfired.]\n\nAll day the little party waited for them. At evening they had not yet\nreturned, and great fears were entertained. At last, about eleven\no'clock, Wilson announced their approach. They arrived, worn out with\nthe fatigues of a six-mile journey.\n\n\"The bridge? Is it there?\" asked Glenarvan, rushing to meet them.\n\n\"Yes, a bridge of rushes,\" said Captain Mangles. \"The convicts passed,\nit is true, but----\"\n\n\"But what?\" cried Glenarvan, who foresaw a new calamity.\n\n\"They burned it after their passage,\" replied Paganel.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIII.\n\nHELPLESS AND HOPELESS.\n\n\nIt was not the time to despair, but to act. If Kemple Pier bridge was\ndestroyed, they must cross the Snowy at all events, and reach Twofold\nBay before Ben Joyce's band. They lost no time, therefore, in vain\nwords; but the next day Captain Mangles and Glenarvan went to examine\nthe river, preparatory to a passage.\n\nThe tumultuous waters, swollen by the rains, had not subsided. They\nwhirled along with indescribable fury. It was certain death to brave\nthis torrent. Glenarvan, with folded arms and lowered head, stood\nmotionless.\n\n\"Do you wish me to try to swim to the opposite bank?\" asked Captain\nMangles.\n\n\"No, John,\" replied Glenarvan, seizing the bold young man by the hand;\n\"let us wait.\"\n\nThey both returned to the encampment. The day was passed in the most\nlively anxiety. Ten times did Glenarvan return to the river. He sought\nto contrive some bold plan of crossing it, but in va"}]}

Who knows whether we shall not arrive in time to prevent\nthis calamity?\"\n\n\"Let us start!\" cried Glenarvan.\n\nCaptain Mangles and Wilson at once occupied themselves in constructing\na raft of large dimensions. Experience had proved that pieces of bark\ncould not resist the violence of the torrent. The captain cut down\nseveral gum-trees, of which he made a rude but substantial raft. It was\na tedious task, and that day ended before the work was completed; but\nthe next day it was finished.\n\nThe waters had now considerably subsided. The torrent had become a\nriver again, with a rapid current. However, with proper management, the\ncaptain hoped to reach the opposite bank.\n\nAt noon they put on board as much provisions as each could carry for\ntwo days' travel. The rest was abandoned with the cart and the tent.\nMulready was well enough to be moved; he was recovering rapidly.\n\nEach took his place on the raft, which was moored to the bank. Captain\nMangles had arranged on the starboard side, and confided to Wilson, a\nkind of oar to sustain the raft against the current, and prevent its\ndrifting. As for himself, he stood at the stern, and steered by means\nof a clumsy rudder. Lady Helena and Mary Grant occupied the centre\nof the raft near Mulready. Glenarvan, the major, Paganel, and Robert\nsurrounded them, ready to lend assistance.\n\n\"Are we ready, Wilson?\" asked Captain Mangles.\n\n\"Yes, captain,\" replied the sailor, seizing his oar with a firm hand.\n\n[Illustration: However, the raft was entangled in the midst of the\nriver, half a mile below where they started.]\n\n\"Attention, and bear up against the current.\"\n\nCaptain Mangles unmoored the raft, and with one push launched it into\nthe current of the river. All went well for some time, and Wilson\nresisted the leeway. But soon the craft was drawn into the eddies, and\nturned round and round, so that neither oar nor rudder could keep it in\na straight course. In spite of their efforts, they were soon placed in\na position where it was impossible to use the oars.\n\nThey were forced to be passive; there was no means of preventing this\ngyratory motion. They were whirled about with a giddy rapidity, and\nsent out of their course. The captain, with pale face and set teeth,\nstood and gazed at the eddying water.\n\nHowever, the raft was entangled in the midst of the river, half a mile\nbelow where they started. The current here was very strong, and, as\nit broke the eddies, it lessened the whirling motion. The captain and\nWilson resumed their oars, and succeeded in propelling the craft in an\noblique direction. In this way they approached nearer the left bank,\nand were only a few yards distant, when Wilson's oar broke. The raft,\nno longer sustained against the current, was carried down stream. The\ncaptain endeavored to prevent it, at the risk of breaking his rudder,\nand Wilson with bleeding hands assisted him.\n\nAt last they succeeded, and the raft, after a voyage of more than half\nan hour, ran upon the steeply-sloping bank. The shock was violent; the\ntimbers were thrown apart, the ropes broken, and the foaming water came\nthrough. The travelers had only time to cling to the bushes that hung\nover the stream. They extricated Mulready and the two ladies, who were\nhalf drenched. In short, everybody was saved; but the greater part of\nthe provisions and arms, except the major's rifle, were swept away with\nthe fragments of the raft.\n\n[Sidenote: A WEARY PILGRIMAGE.]\n\nThe river was crossed, but the little party"}, {"chunk_id": 150, "text": "on a good\nfooting with your mate, and in six days I engage to bring the Duncan to\nTwofold Bay.\"\n\n\"Well said!\" replied Glenarvan. \"You are a brave and intelligent man,\nAyrton, and will succeed.\"\n\nThe quartermaster was evidently more capable than any one else of\nfulfilling this difficult mission. Captain Mangles raised one final\nobjection, that Ayrton's presence was necessary to enable them to\nfind traces of the Brittania or Captain Grant; but the major observed\nthat they should remain encamped on the banks of the Snowy till the\nmessenger's return, that it was not proposed to resume the search\nwithout him, and that consequently his absence could be in no way\nprejudicial to their interests.\n\n\"Well then, Ayrton, start,\" said Glenarvan. \"Make haste, and return to\nthe encampment by way of Eden.\"\n\nA gleam of satisfaction seemed to light up the eyes of the\nquartermaster. He turned his head to one side, though not so quickly\nbut that Captain Mangles had intercepted his glance, and instinctively\nfelt his suspicions increased.\n\nThe quartermaster made his preparations for departure, aided by the\ntwo sailors, one of whom attended to his horse, and the other to his\nprovisions. Meantime Glenarvan wrote the letter designed for Tom Austin.\n\nHe ordered the mate of the Duncan to repair without delay to Twofold\nBay, and recommended the quartermaster to him as a man in whom he could\nplace entire confidence. As soon as he arrived at the bay, he was to\nsend a detachment of sailors under the command of Ayrton.\n\nHe had just reached this part of his letter, when the major, who had\nbeen looking over his shoulder, asked him, in a singular tone, how he\nwrote the word Ayrton.\n\n\"As it is pronounced,\" replied Glenarvan.\n\n\"That is a mistake,\" said the major coolly. \"It is pronounced Ayrton,\nbut it is written 'Ben Joyce'!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLI.\n\nTHE PLOT UNVEILED.\n\n\nThe sound of the name of Ben Joyce fell upon the party like a\nthunderbolt. Ayrton suddenly sprang to his feet. In his hand was a\nrevolver. A report was heard; and Glenarvan fell, struck by a bullet.\n\nBefore Captain Mangles and the sailors recovered from the surprise into\nwhich this unexpected turn of affairs had thrown them, the audacious\nconvict had escaped, and joined his band, scattered along the edge of\nthe wood of gum-trees.\n\n[Illustration: A report was heard; and Glenarvan fell, struck by a\nbullet.]\n\nThe tent did not offer a sufficient shelter against the bullets, and\nit was clearly necessary to beat a retreat. Glenarvan, who was but\nslightly injured, had risen.\n\n\"To the cart! to the cart!\" cried Captain Mangles, as he hurried on\nLady Helena and Mary Grant, who were soon in safety behind its stout\nsides.\n\nThe captain, the major, Paganel, and the sailors then seized their\nrifles, and stood ready to repel the convicts. Glenarvan and Robert had\njoined the ladies, while Olbinett hastened to the common defence.\n\nThese events had transpired with the rapidity of lightning. Captain\nMangles attentively watched the edge of the wood; but the reports\nsuddenly ceased on the arrival of Ben Joyce, and a profound silence\nsucceeded the noisy fusillade. A few wreaths of white smoke were still\ncurling up between the branches of the gum-trees, but the tall tufts of\ngastrolobium were motionless and all signs of attack had disappeared.\n\nThe major and Captain Mangles extended their examinations as far as the\ngreat trees. The place was abandoned. Numerous footprints were seen,\nand a few half-burnt cartridges smoked on the ground. The major, like\na prudent man, extinguished them, for a spark was enough to kindle a\nformidable conflagration in this forest of dry trees.\n\n\"The convicts have disappeared,\" said Captain Mangles.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the major; \"and this disappearance alarms me. I should\nprefer to meet them face to face. It is better to encounter a tiger in\nthe open plain than a serpent in the grass.

Let us not, therefore, be led astray\nby vain conjectures, but only be certain that Ayrton is Ben Joyce, a\nsailor of the Britannia, now chief of a band of convicts.\"\n\nThe major's explanation was accepted as conclusive.\n\n\"Now,\" replied Glenarvan, \"will you tell me how and why Harry Grant's\nquartermaster is in Australia?\"\n\n\"How, I do not know,\" said MacNabb; \"and the police declare they know\nno more than I on the subject.

Chance threw us in his way. He heard Glenarvan's story of the\nshipwreck, and, like a bold man, he promptly decided to take part in\nthe expedition. At the Wimerra he communicated with one of his friends,\nthe farrier of Black Point, and thus left distinguishable traces of\nour course. His band followed us. A poisonous plant enabled him to\ngradually kill our oxen and horses. Then, at the proper moment, he\nentangled us in the marshes of the Snowy, and surrendered us to the\nconvicts he commanded.\"\n\nEverything possible had been said concerning Ben Joyce. His past had\njust been reviewed by the major, and the wretch appeared as he was,--a\nbold and formidable criminal. His intentions had been clearly proved,\nand required, on the part of Glenarvan, extreme vigilance. Fortunately,\nthere was less to fear from the detected bandit than the secret traitor.\n\nBut one serious fact appeared from this explanation. No one had yet\nthought of it; only Mary Grant, disregarding the past, looked forward\nto the future. Captain Mangles first saw her pale and disconsolate. He\nunderstood what was passing in her mind.\n\n\"Miss Mary!\" cried he, \"you are weeping!\"\n\n\"What is the matter, my child?\" asked Lady Helena.\n\n\"My father, madam, my father!\" replied the young girl.\n\nShe could not continue. But a sudden revelation dawned on the mind of\neach. They comprehended Mary's grief, why the tears flowed from her\neyes, why the "}, {"chunk_id": 166, "text": "ding, he judged it advisable to visit the ship\nin question. Accordingly, he, with Glenarvan, the major, Paganel, and\nRobert, took a boat, and pulled out to where it was anchored.\n\nIt was a brig of two hundred and fifty tons, called the Macquarie,\nwhich traded between the different ports of Australia and New Zealand.\nThe captain, or rather the \"master,\" received his visitors very\ngruffly. They saw that they had to deal with an uneducated man, whose\nmanners were not different from those of the five sailors of his\ncrew. A coarse red face, big hands, a flat nose, a blinded eye, lips\nblackened by his pipe, and a specially brutish appearance, made Will\nHalley a very forbidding character. But they had no choice, and for a\nvoyage of a few days there was no need to be very particular.\n\n\"What do you want?\" asked Will Halley, as the strangers reached the\ndeck of his vessel.\n\n\"The captain,\" replied Mangles.\n\n[Sidenote: A BUSINESS INTERVIEW.]\n\n\"I am he,\" said Halley. \"What then?\"\n\n\"The Macquarie is loading for Auckland?\"\n\n\"Yes. What of it?\"\n\n\"What does she carry?\"\n\n\"Anything that is bought or sold.\"\n\n\"When does she sail?\"\n\n\"To-morrow, at the noon tide.\"\n\n\"Would she take passengers?\"\n\n\"That depends upon the passengers, and whether they would be satisfied\nwith the ship's mess.\"\n\n\"They would take their own provisions.\"\n\n\"Well, how many are there?\"\n\n\"Nine,--two of them ladies.\"\n\n\"I have no cabins.\"\n\n\"We will arrange a place for their exclusive use.\"\n\n\"What then?\"\n\n\"Do you accept?\" asked Captain Mangles, who was not embarrassed by this\ncurtness.\n\n\"I must see,\" replied the master of the Macquarie. He took a turn or\ntwo, striking the deck with his heavy, hobnailed boots; then, turning\nto Captain Mangles, said:\n\n\"What do you pay?\"\n\n\"What do you ask?\" was the reply.\n\n\"Fifty pounds.\"\n\nGlenarvan nodded assent.\n\n\"Very well! Fifty pounds.\"\n\n\"But the passage in cash!\" added Halley.\n\n\"In cash.\"\n\n\"Food separate?\"\n\n\"Separate.\"\n\n\"Agreed. Well?\" said Will Halley, holding out his hand.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"The advance-money.\"\n\n\"Here is half the fare,--twenty-five pounds,\" said Captain Mangles,\ncounting out the sum, which the master pocketed without saying \"thank\nyou.\"\n\n\"Be on board to-morrow,\" said he. \"Whether you are here or not, I shall\nweigh anchor.\"\n\n\"We will be here.\"\n\nThereupon Glenarvan, the major, Robert, Paganel, and Captain Mangles\nleft the vessel, without Will Halley's having so much as touched the\nbrim of his hat.\n\n\"What a stupid fellow!\" was their first remark.\n\n\"Well, I like him,\" replied Paganel. \"He is a real sea-wolf.\"\n\n\"A real bear!\" remarked the major.\n\n\"And I imagine,\" added Captain Mangles, \"that this bear has at some\ntime traded in human flesh.\"\n\n\"What matter,\" replied Glenarvan, \"so long as he commands the\nMacquarie, which goes to New Zealand? We shall see very little of him\non the voyage.\"\n\nLady Helena and Mary Grant were very much pleased to know that they\nwere to start the next day. Glenarvan observed, however, that the\nMacquarie could not equal the Duncan for comfort; but, after so many\nhardships, they were not likely to be overcome by trifles. Mr. Olbinett\nwas requested to take charge of the provisions. The poor man, since the\nloss of the Duncan, had often lamented the unhappy fate of his wife,\nwho had remained on board, and would be, consequently, the victim of\nthe convicts' brutality. However, he fulfilled his duties as steward\nwith his accustomed zeal, and their food might yet consist of dishes\nthat were never seen on the ship's table.\n\nIn the mean time the major discounted at a money-changer's some drafts\nthat Glenarvan had on the Union Bank of Melbourne. As for Paganel, he\nprocured an excellent map of New Zealand.\n\nMulready was now quite well. He scarcely felt his wound, which had so\nnearly proved fatal. A few hours at sea would complete his recovery.\n\n[Illustration: The landlord of Victoria Hotel furnished them with two\nhorses, and they set out.]\n\nWilson went on board first, charged with arranging the passengers'\nquarters. Under his v"}, {"chunk_id": 160, "text": "cry.\n\nMacNabb continued:\n\n[Sidenote: A HOPELESS CHANCE.]\n\n\"'Now, you others,' said Ben Joyce, 'catch the horse. In two days I\nshall be on board the Duncan, and in six at Twofold Bay. There is the\nplace of meeting. The lord's party will be still fast in the marshes\nof the Snowy. Cross the river at Kemple Pier bridge, go to the coast,\nand wait for me. I will find means to bring you on board. With the\ncrew once at sea, and a vessel like the Duncan, we shall be masters\nof the Indian Ocean.' 'Hurrah for Ben Joyce!' cried the convicts.\nMulready's horse was then led up, and Ben Joyce disappeared at a gallop\non the Lucknow road, while the band proceeded southeastward to the\nSnowy River. Mulready, although severely wounded, had strength to drag\nhimself within two hundred paces of the encampment, where we picked him\nup almost dead. This,\" added MacNabb, \"is Mulready's sad story. You\nunderstand now why the courageous sailor wished so much to speak.\"\n\nThis revelation terrified all.\n\n\"Pirates! pirates!\" cried Glenarvan. \"My crew massacred, my Duncan in\nthe hands of these bandits!\"\n\n\"Yes, for Ben Joyce will surprise the vessel,\" replied the major, \"and\nthen----\"\n\n\"Well, we must reach the coast before these wretches,\" said Paganel.\n\n\"But how cross the Snowy?\" asked Wilson.\n\n\"Like them,\" answered Glenarvan. \"They will cross Kemple Pier bridge,\nand we will do the same.\"\n\n\"But what will become of Mulready?\" inquired Lady Helena.\n\n\"We will take turns in carrying him. Shall I give up my defenceless\ncrew to Ben Joyce's band?\"\n\nThe plan of crossing Kemple Pier bridge was practicable, but perilous.\nThe convicts might locate themselves at this point to defend it. It\nwould be at least thirty against seven! But there are moments when we\ndo not think of these things, when we must advance at all hazards.\n\n\"My lord,\" said Captain Mangles, at length, \"before risking our\nlast chance, before venturing towards the bridge, it is prudent to\nreconnoitre it first. I will undertake this.\"\n\n\"I will accompany you, captain,\" replied Paganel.\n\n[Sidenote: THE BURNED BRIDGE.]\n\nThis proposal was accepted, and the captain and Paganel prepared to\nstart immediately. They were to follow along the bank of the river till\nthey came to the place indicated by Ben Joyce, and keep out of sight\nof the convicts, who were probably lying in wait. These two courageous\nmen accordingly, well furnished with arms and provisions, set out, and\nsoon disappeared among the tall rushes of the river.\n\n[Illustration: The animal reared. Mulready seized his revolver and\nfired.]\n\nAll day the little party waited for them. At evening they had not yet\nreturned, and great fears were entertained. At last, about eleven\no'clock, Wilson announced their approach. They arrived, worn out with\nthe fatigues of a six-mile journey.\n\n\"The bridge? Is it there?\" asked Glenarvan, rushing to meet them.\n\n\"Yes, a bridge of rushes,\" said Captain Mangles. \"The convicts passed,\nit is true, but----\"\n\n\"But what?\" cried Glenarvan, who foresaw a new calamity.\n\n\"They burned it after their passage,\" replied Paganel.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIII.\n\nHELPLESS AND HOPELESS.\n\n\nIt was not the time to despair, but to act. If Kemple Pier bridge was\ndestroyed, they must cross the Snowy at all events, and reach Twofold\nBay before Ben Joyce's band. They lost no time, therefore, in vain\nwords; but the next day Captain Mangles and Glenarvan went to examine\nthe river, preparatory to a passage.\n\nThe tumultuous waters, swollen by the rains, had not subsided. They\nwhirled along with indescribable fury. It was certain death to brave\nthis torrent. Glenarvan, with folded arms and lowered head, stood\nmotionless.\n\n\"Do you wish me to try to swim to the opposite bank?\" asked Captain\nMangles.\n\n\"No, John,\" replied Glenarvan, seizing the bold young man by the hand;\n\"let us wait.\"\n\nThey both returned to the encampment. The day was passed in the most\nlively anxiety. Ten times did Glenarvan return to the river. He sought\nto contrive some bold plan of crossing it, but in va"}, {"chunk_id": 217, "text": "What do you mean, Tom?\" inquired Glenarvan.\n\n\"I mean,\" he replied, \"that when the quartermaster, Ayrton, learned,\nthe day after our departure, the Duncan's destination----\"\n\n\"Ayrton!\" cried Glenarvan. \"Is he on board?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord.\"\n\n\"Ayrton here!\" repeated Glenarvan, glancing at Captain Mangles.\n\n\"Wonderful indeed!\" said the young captain.\n\nIn an instant, with the swiftness of lightning, Ayrton's conduct, his\nlong-contrived treachery, Glenarvan's wound, the attack upon Mulready,\ntheir sufferings in the marshes of the Snowy, all the wretch's deeds,\nflashed upon the minds of the two men. And now, by a strange fatality,\nthe convict was in their power.\n\n\"Where is he?\" asked Glenarvan quickly.\n\n\"In a cabin in the forecastle,\" replied Tom Austin, \"closely guarded.\"\n\n\"Why this confinement?\"\n\n[Sidenote: AN UNOFFICIAL TRIBUNAL.]\n\n\"Because, when Ayrton saw that the yacht was sailing for New Zealand,\nhe flew into a passion; because he attempted to force me to change the\nship's course; because he threatened me; and, finally, because he urged\nmy men to a mutiny. I saw that he was a dangerous person, and was\ncompelled, therefore, to take precautions against him.\"\n\n\"And since that time?\"\n\n\"Since that time he has been in his cabin, without offering to come\nout.\"\n\n\"Good!\"\n\nAt this moment Glenarvan and Captain Mangles were summoned to the\nsaloon. Breakfast, which they so much needed, was ready. They took\nseats at the table, but did not speak of Ayrton.\n\nHowever, when the meal was ended, and the passengers had assembled on\ndeck, Glenarvan informed them of the quartermaster's presence on board.\nAt the same time he declared his intention of sending for him.\n\n\"Can I be released from attending this tribunal?\" asked Lady Helena.\n\"I confess to you, my dear Edward, that the sight of this unfortunate\nwould be very painful to me.\"\n\n\"It is only to confront him, Helena,\" replied Glenarvan. \"Remain,\nif you can. Ben Joyce should see himself face to face with all his\nintended victims.\"\n\nLady Helena yielded to this request, and Mary Grant and she took their\nplaces beside him, while around them stood the major, Paganel, Captain\nMangles, Robert, Wilson, Mulready, and Olbinett, all who had suffered\nso severely by the convict's treason. The crew of the yacht, who did\nnot yet understand the seriousness of these proceedings, maintained a\nprofound silence.\n\n\"Call Ayrton!\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVI.\n\nAYRTON'S OBSTINACY.\n\n\nAyrton soon made his appearance. He crossed the deck with a confident\nstep, and ascended the poop-stairs. His eyes had a sullen look, his\nteeth were set, and his fists clinched convulsively. His bearing\ndisplayed neither exultation nor humility. As soon as he was in Lord\nGlenarvan's presence, he folded his arms, and calmly and silently\nwaited to be questioned:\n\n\"Ayrton,\" said Glenarvan, \"here we all are, as you see, on board the\nDuncan, that you would have surrendered to Ben Joyce's accomplices.\"\n\nAt these words the lips of the quartermaster slightly trembled. A quick\nblush colored his hard features,--not the sign of remorse, but the\nshame of defeat. He was prisoner on this yacht that he had meant to\ncommand as master, and his fate was soon to be decided.\n\nHowever, he made no reply. Glenarvan waited patiently, but Ayrton still\npersisted in maintaining an obstinate silence.\n\n\"Speak, Ayrton; what have you to say?\" continued Glenarvan.\n\nThe convict hesitated, and the lines of his forehead were strongly\ncontracted. At last he said, in a calm voice:\n\n\"I have nothing to say, my lord. I was foolish enough to let myself be\ntaken. Do what you please.\"\n\n[Sidenote: A DUMB PRISONER.]\n\nHaving given his answer, the quartermaster turned his eyes toward\nthe coast that extended along the west, and affected a profound\nindifference for all that was passing around him. You would have\nthought, to look at him, that he was a stranger to this serious affair.\n\nBut Glenarvan had resolved to be patient. A powerful motive urged\nhim to ascertain certain circumstances o"}, {"chunk_id": 113, "text": "hed\nthe hospitable dwelling of Mr. O'Moore, where his labor insured him a\ncomfortable livelihood.\n\n\"And if Ayrton is pleased with me,\" said the Irish colonist, when the\nstory was finished, \"I cannot but be pleased with him. He is an honest\nand intelligent man, a good worker, and, if he chooses, this house\nshall long be at his service.\"\n\nAyrton thanked Mr. O'Moore, and waited for further questions. He\nprobably thought, however, that the legitimate curiosity of his hearers\nought to be satisfied. What could he say that had not been repeated\na hundred times already? Glenarvan was, therefore, about to open the\nconversation on a new topic, to profit by the information received from\nAyrton, when the major, addressing him, said:\n\n\"You were quartermaster of the Britannia?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Ayrton.\n\nBut perceiving that a certain feeling of distrust, a doubt, however\nslight, had suggested this inquiry, he added,--\n\n\"I saved my contract from the wreck.\"\n\nHe immediately left the room in search of this authoritative document.\nDuring his absence, which lasted but a few moments, Mr. O'Moore said:\n\n\"My lord, I will answer for it that Ayrton is an honest man. During the\ntwo months that he has been in my employ, I have had no fault to find\nwith him. I knew the story of his shipwreck and captivity. He is a true\nman, and worthy of your entire confidence.\"\n\nGlenarvan was about to answer that he had never doubted Ayrton's\nhonesty, when the latter returned and presented his contract. It was a\npaper signed by the owners of the Britannia and Captain Grant, whose\nwriting Mary recognized immediately. It stated that \"Tom Ayrton, able\nseaman, was engaged as quartermaster on board the brig Britannia of\nGlasgow.\" There was, therefore, no possible doubt of Ayrton's identity,\nfor it would have been difficult to suppose that this contract could be\nin his hands and not belong to him.\n\n[Sidenote: ENTANGLEMENTS.]\n\n\"Now,\" said Glenarvan, \"I appeal to you all for advice as to what is\nbest to be done. Your advice, Ayrton, would be particularly valuable,\nand I should be much obliged if you would give it to us.\"\n\nThe sailor reflected a few moments, and then replied:\n\n\"I thank you, my lord, for the confidence you place in me, and hope to\nshow myself worthy of it. I have some knowledge of the country, and of\nthe customs of the natives; and, if I can be of use to you----\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" replied Glenarvan.\n\n\"I think, like you,\" continued Ayrton, \"that Captain Grant and his two\nsailors were saved from the shipwreck; but, since they have not reached\nthe English possessions, since they have not reappeared, I doubt not\nthat their fate was the same as my own, and that they are prisoners of\nthe natives.\"\n\n\"You repeat, Mr. Ayrton, the arguments that I have already\nsubstantiated,\" said Paganel. \"The shipwrecked seamen are evidently\nprisoners of the natives, as they feared. But ought we to suppose that,\nlike you, they have been carried to the north?\"\n\n\"It is quite likely, sir,\" replied Ayrton. \"The hostile tribes would\nhardly remain in the neighborhood of the English provinces.\"\n\n\"This fact will complicate our search,\" said Glenarvan, quite\ndisconcerted. \"How shall we find the traces of the prisoners in the\ninterior of so vast a continent?\"\n\nA prolonged silence followed this remark. Lady Helena frequently\ncast a questioning glance at her companions, but without eliciting a\nresponsive sign. Paganel himself was silent, contrary to his custom.\nHis usual ingenuity now failed him. Captain Mangles paced the room with\nlong strides, as if he had been on the deck of his vessel, involved in\nsome difficulty.\n\n\"And you, Mr. Ayrton,\" said Lady Helena, at length, to the\nquartermaster, \"what would you do?\"\n\n\"Madam,\" replied he, promptly, \"I should re-embark on board the Duncan,\nand go straight to the place of the shipwreck. There I should act\naccording to circumstances, or indications that chance might furnish.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" said Glenarvan; \"but we must wait till the Duncan is\nrepaired.\"\n\n\"Ah! you"}]}

His past had\njust been reviewed by the major, and the wretch appeared as he was,--a\nbold and formidable criminal.

Fortunately,\nthere was less to fear from the detected bandit than the secret traitor.\n\nBut one serious fact appeared from this explanation. No one had yet\nthought of it; only Mary Grant, disregarding the past, looked forward\nto the future. Captain Mangles first saw her pale and disconsolate. He\nunderstood what was passing in her mind.\n\n\"Miss Mary!\" cried he, \"you are weeping!\"\n\n\"What is the matter, my child?\" asked Lady Helena.\n\n\"My father, madam, my father!\" replied the young girl.\n\nShe could not continue.

These convicts are twenty-nine in\nnumber, and are commanded by a certain Ben Joyce, a dangerous criminal,\nwho arrived in Australia several months ago in some way, and upon whom\njustice has not yet succeeded in laying hands. The inhabitants of the\ncities, and the colonists and squatters of the stations, are warned\nto be on their guard, and requested to send to the undersigned any\ninformation which may assist his investigations.\n\n                              \"J.

These people have no\nright to be here.\"\n\n\"Well, at any rate they are here,\" continued Glenarvan; \"but I do not\nsuppose that their presence need cause us to change our plans or delay\nour journey. What do you think, captain?\"\n\n[Sidenote: LOOKING AT BOTH SIDES.]\n\nCaptain Mangles did not answer immediately. He hesitated between the\ngrief that the abandonment of the search would cause the two children,\nand the fear of compromising the safety of the party.\n\n\"If Lady Glenarvan and Miss Grant were not with us,\" said he, \"I should\ncare very little for this band of wretches.\"\n\nGlenarvan understood him, and added:\n\n\"Of course it is not advisable to give up our undertaking; but perhaps\nit would be prudent for the sake of the ladies to join the Duncan at\nMelbourne, and continue our search for Captain Grant towards the east.\nWhat do you think, MacNabb?\"\n\n\"Before replying,\" said the major, \"I should like to hear Ayrton's\nopinion.\"\n\nThe quartermaster, thus addressed, looked at Glenarvan.\n\n\"I think,\" said he, \"that, as we are two hundred miles from Melbourne,\nthe danger, if there is any, is as great on the southern as on the\neastern road. Both are little frequented, and one is as good as the\nother. Moreover, I do not think that thirty malefactors can intimidate\neight well-armed and resolute men. Therefore, in the absence of better\nadvice, I should go on.\"\n\n\"Well said,\" replied Paganel. \"By continuing our course we shall cross\nCaptain Grant's track, while by returning to the south we should go\ndirectly away from it. I agree with you, therefore, and shall give\nmyself no uneasiness about the runaway convicts.\"\n\nThus the determination to make no change in the programme was\nunanimously approved of.\n\n\"One more remark, my lord,\" said Ayrton, as they were about to separate.\n\n\"Speak.\"\n\n\"Would it not be advisable to send an order to the Duncan to sail to\nthe coast?\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked Captain Mangles. \"It will be time enough to send the order\nwhen we arrive at Twofold Bay.

Do what you please.\"\n\n[Sidenote: A DUMB PRISONER.]\n\nHaving given his answer, the quartermaster turned his eyes toward\nthe coast that extended along the west, and affected a profound\nindifference for all that was passing around him. You would have\nthought, to look at him, that he was a stranger to this serious affair.\n\nBut Glenarvan had resolved to be patient. A powerful motive urged\nhim to ascertain certain circumstances of Ayrton's mysterious life,\nespecially as regarded Harry Grant and the Britannia. He therefore\nresumed his inquiries, speaking with extreme mildness, and imposing the\nmost perfect calmness upon the violent agitation of his heart.\n\n\"I hope, Ayrton,\" continued he, \"that you will not refuse to answer\ncertain questions that I desire to ask you. And, first, am I to call\nyou Ayrton or Ben Joyce? Are you the quartermaster of the Britannia?\"\n\nAyrton remained unmoved, watching the coast, deaf to every question.\nGlenarvan, whose eye flashed with some inward emotion, continued to\nquestion him.\n\n\"Will you tell me how you left the Britannia, and why you were in\nAustralia?\"\n\nThere was the same silence, the same obstinacy.\n\n\"Listen to me, Ayrton,\" resumed Glenarvan. \"It is for your interest to\nspeak. We may reward a frank confession, which is your only resort. For\nthe last time, will you answer my questions?\"\n\nAyrton turned his head towards Glenarvan, and looked him full in the\nface.\n\n\"My lord,\" said he, \"I have nothing to answer. It is for justice to\nprove against me.\"\n\n\"The proofs will be easy,\" replied Glenarvan.\n\n[Sidenote: USELESS APPEALS.]\n\n\"Easy, my lord?\" continued the quartermaster, in a sneering tone.\n\"Your lordship seems to me very hasty. I declare that the best judge\nin Westminster Hall would be puzzled to establish my identity. Who can\nsay why I came to Australia, since Captain Grant is no longer here to\ninform you? Who can prove that I am that Ben Joyce described by the\npolice, since they have never laid hands upon me, and my companions are\nat liberty? Who, except you, can charge me, not to say with a crime,\nbut even with a culpable action?\"\n\n[Illustration: Ayrton soon made his appearance. He crossed the deck\nwith a confident step, and ascended the poop-stairs.]\n\nAyrton had grown animated while speaking, but soon relapsed into his\nformer indifference. He doubtless imagined that this declaration would\nend the examination: but Glenarvan resumed, and said:\n\n\"Ayrton, I am not a judge charged with trying you. This is not my\nbusiness. It is important that our respective positions should be\nclearly defined. I ask nothing that can implicate you, for that is the\npart of justice. But you know what search I am pursuing, and, with a\nword, you can put me on the track I have lost. Will you speak?\"\n\nAyrton shook his head, like a man determined to keep silent.\n\n\"Will you tell me where Captain Grant is?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"No, my lord.\"\n\n\"Will you point out where the Britannia was wrecked?\"\n\n\"Certainly not.\"\n\n\"Ayrton,\" said Glenarvan, in almost a suppliant tone, \"will you, at\nleast, if you know where Captain Grant is, tell his poor children, who\nare only waiting for a word from your lips?\"\n\nThe quartermaster hesitated; his features quivered; but, in a low\nvoice, he muttered:\n\n\"I cannot, my lord.\"\n\nThen, as if he reproached himself for a moment's weakness, he added,\nangrily:\n\n\"No, I will not speak! Hang me if you will!\"\n\n\"Hang, then!\" cried Glenarvan, overcome by a sudden feeling of\nindignation.\n\nBut finally controlling himself, he said, in a grave voice:\n\n\"There are neither judges nor hangmen here. At the first landing-place\nyou shall be put into the hands of the English authorities.\"\n\n\"Just what I desire,\" replied the quartermaster.\n\nThereupon he was taken back to the cabin that served as his prison, and\ntwo sailors were stationed at the door, with orders to watch all his\nmovements. The witnesses of this scene retired indignant and in despair.\n\nSince Gl"}, {"chunk_id": 217, "text": "What do you mean, Tom?\" inquired Glenarvan.\n\n\"I mean,\" he replied, \"that when the quartermaster, Ayrton, learned,\nthe day after our departure, the Duncan's destination----\"\n\n\"Ayrton!\" cried Glenarvan. \"Is he on board?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord.\"\n\n\"Ayrton here!\" repeated Glenarvan, glancing at Captain Mangles.\n\n\"Wonderful indeed!\" said the young captain.\n\nIn an instant, with the swiftness of lightning, Ayrton's conduct, his\nlong-contrived treachery, Glenarvan's wound, the attack upon Mulready,\ntheir sufferings in the marshes of the Snowy, all the wretch's deeds,\nflashed upon the minds of the two men. And now, by a strange fatality,\nthe convict was in their power.\n\n\"Where is he?\" asked Glenarvan quickly.\n\n\"In a cabin in the forecastle,\" replied Tom Austin, \"closely guarded.\"\n\n\"Why this confinement?\"\n\n[Sidenote: AN UNOFFICIAL TRIBUNAL.]\n\n\"Because, when Ayrton saw that the yacht was sailing for New Zealand,\nhe flew into a passion; because he attempted to force me to change the\nship's course; because he threatened me; and, finally, because he urged\nmy men to a mutiny. I saw that he was a dangerous person, and was\ncompelled, therefore, to take precautions against him.\"\n\n\"And since that time?\"\n\n\"Since that time he has been in his cabin, without offering to come\nout.\"\n\n\"Good!\"\n\nAt this moment Glenarvan and Captain Mangles were summoned to the\nsaloon. Breakfast, which they so much needed, was ready. They took\nseats at the table, but did not speak of Ayrton.\n\nHowever, when the meal was ended, and the passengers had assembled on\ndeck, Glenarvan informed them of the quartermaster's presence on board.\nAt the same time he declared his intention of sending for him.\n\n\"Can I be released from attending this tribunal?\" asked Lady Helena.\n\"I confess to you, my dear Edward, that the sight of this unfortunate\nwould be very painful to me.\"\n\n\"It is only to confront him, Helena,\" replied Glenarvan. \"Remain,\nif you can. Ben Joyce should see himself face to face with all his\nintended victims.\"\n\nLady Helena yielded to this request, and Mary Grant and she took their\nplaces beside him, while around them stood the major, Paganel, Captain\nMangles, Robert, Wilson, Mulready, and Olbinett, all who had suffered\nso severely by the convict's treason. The crew of the yacht, who did\nnot yet understand the seriousness of these proceedings, maintained a\nprofound silence.\n\n\"Call Ayrton!\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVI.\n\nAYRTON'S OBSTINACY.\n\n\nAyrton soon made his appearance. He crossed the deck with a confident\nstep, and ascended the poop-stairs. His eyes had a sullen look, his\nteeth were set, and his fists clinched convulsively. His bearing\ndisplayed neither exultation nor humility. As soon as he was in Lord\nGlenarvan's presence, he folded his arms, and calmly and silently\nwaited to be questioned:\n\n\"Ayrton,\" said Glenarvan, \"here we all are, as you see, on board the\nDuncan, that you would have surrendered to Ben Joyce's accomplices.\"\n\nAt these words the lips of the quartermaster slightly trembled. A quick\nblush colored his hard features,--not the sign of remorse, but the\nshame of defeat. He was prisoner on this yacht that he had meant to\ncommand as master, and his fate was soon to be decided.\n\nHowever, he made no reply. Glenarvan waited patiently, but Ayrton still\npersisted in maintaining an obstinate silence.\n\n\"Speak, Ayrton; what have you to say?\" continued Glenarvan.\n\nThe convict hesitated, and the lines of his forehead were strongly\ncontracted. At last he said, in a calm voice:\n\n\"I have nothing to say, my lord. I was foolish enough to let myself be\ntaken. Do what you please.\"\n\n[Sidenote: A DUMB PRISONER.]\n\nHaving given his answer, the quartermaster turned his eyes toward\nthe coast that extended along the west, and affected a profound\nindifference for all that was passing around him. You would have\nthought, to look at him, that he was a stranger to this serious affair.\n\nBut Glenarvan had resolved to be patient. A powerful motive urged\nhim to ascertain certain circumstances o"}, {"chunk_id": 142, "text": " brandy, and\nwhisky of his tavern, and scarcely ever saw any one but squatters or\nherdsmen.\n\nHe replied in an ill-humored way to the questions that were addressed\nhim; but his answers sufficed to determine Ayrton upon his course.\nGlenarvan, however, remunerated the tavern-keeper for the little\ntrouble they had given him, and was about to leave the inn, when a\nplacard, affixed to the wall, attracted his attention. It was a notice\nof the colonial police, detailing the escape of the convicts from\nPerth, and setting a price upon the head of Ben Joyce--a hundred pounds\nsterling to any one who should deliver him up.\n\n\"Indeed,\" said Glenarvan, \"that is a rascal worth hanging.\"\n\n\"And especially worth taking,\" replied Ayrton. \"A hundred pounds! What\na sum! He is not worth it.\"\n\n\"As for the inn-keeper,\" added Glenarvan, as he left the room, \"I\nscarcely put faith in him, despite his placard.\"\n\n\"Nor I either,\" said Ayrton.\n\nGlenarvan and the quartermaster rejoined the party, and they all\nproceeded to where a narrow pass wound across the chain. Here they\nbegan the ascent.\n\n[Sidenote: ANOTHER DEATH.]\n\nBut it was an arduous task. More than once the ladies and their\ncompanions had to dismount, and it was often necessary to push the\nwheels of the heavy vehicle at some steep ascent, or to hold it\nback along the edge of some dangerous precipice. The oxen, as they\ncould not work to advantage at sudden turns, had frequently to be\nunyoked, and the cart blocked to prevent it from sliding back. Ayrton\nwas repeatedly forced to bring the already exhausted horses to his\nassistance.\n\nWhether this exertion was too prolonged, or whether from some other\ncause, one of the horses gave out during the ascent. He fell suddenly,\nwithout an instant's warning. It was Mulready's horse; and when the\nsailor attempted to help him up, he found that he was dead. Ayrton\nexamined the animal carefully, but did not seem to understand the cause\nof this sudden death.\n\n\"The beast must have burst a blood-vessel,\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\"Evidently,\" replied Ayrton.\n\n\"Take my horse, Mulready,\" added Glenarvan; \"I will join Lady Helena in\nthe cart.\"\n\nMulready obeyed, and the little party continued their fatiguing ascent,\nabandoning the body to the crows.\n\nThe next day they began the descent, which was much more rapid. During\nits course a violent hail-storm burst on them, and they were forced to\nseek a shelter beneath the rocks. Not hailstones, but pieces of ice as\nlarge as one's hand, were precipitated from the angry clouds. A sling\ncould not have hurled them with greater force, and several sharp blows\nwarned Paganel and Robert to be on their guard. The cart was pierced\nthrough in many places: indeed, few roofs could have resisted the fall\nof these cutting missiles, some of which froze to the trunks of the\ntrees. It was necessary to wait for the end of this avalanche, for fear\nof being stoned to death, and it was an hour before the party regained\nthe steep path, still slippery with icy incrustations. At evening the\ncart, considerably shattered, but still firm on its wooden wheels,\ndescended the last slopes of the Alps, between tall solitary pines, and\nreached the plains of Gippsland.\n\n[Illustration: Not hailstones, but pieces of ice as large as one's\nhand, were precipitated from the angry clouds.]\n\n[Sidenote: DIVIDED COUNSELS.]\n\nAll were impatient to gain their destination, the Pacific Ocean,\nwhere the Britannia had been wrecked. There only could traces of the\nshipwrecked seamen be found, and not in these desert regions. Ayrton\nurged Lord Glenarvan to send an order to the Duncan to repair to the\ncoast, that he might have at his disposal all the aid possible in his\nsearch. In his opinion they ought to take advantage of the Lucknow\nroad, which would lead them to Melbourne. Afterwards this might be\ndifficult, for highways leading directly to the capital would be\nabsolutely wanting.\n\nThis advice of the quartermaster seemed reasonable. Paganel seconded\nit.

His intentions had been clearly proved,\nand required, on the part of Glenarvan, extreme vigilance. Fortunately,\nthere was less to fear from the detected bandit than the secret traitor.\n\nBut one serious fact appeared from this explanation. No one had yet\nthought of it; only Mary Grant, disregarding the past, looked forward\nto the future. Captain Mangles first saw her pale and disconsolate.

Dishes of soup smoked between roast beef and\nlegs of mutton, flanked by large plates of olives, grapes, and oranges.\nThe host and hostess had such an engaging air, and the fare was so\ntempting, so ample, and so abundantly furnished, that it would have\nbeen unbecoming not to accept this rural bounty. The domestics of the\nfarm, the equals of their master, had already come to partake of the\nrepast; and the host reserved the place of honor for the strangers.\n\n\"I expected you,\" said he, quietly, to Lord Glenarvan.\n\n\"You did?\" replied the latter, very much surprised.\n\n\"I always expect those who are coming,\" replied the Irishman.\n\nThen, in a grave voice, while his household stood respectfully, he\ninvoked a Divine blessing. Lady Helena was much affected by his perfect\nsimplicity of manner, and a look from her husband told her that he\nlikewise was touched by it.\n\n[Illustration: A fair and comfortable locality, which the merry mill\ncrowned with its pointed gable and caressed with the moving shadow of\nits sails.]\n\n[Sidenote: THE OLD QUESTION.]\n\nAmple justice was done to the repast. The conversation was general.\nThe colonist told his story. It was like that of most deserving and\nvoluntary emigrants. Many go far to seek their fortunes, and find\nonly sorrow and disaster; they accuse fate, forgetting to blame their\nignorance, laziness, and vices. The man who is sober and persevering,\neconomical and honest, is almost sure to succeed.\n\nThis had been the case with Mr. O'Moore. He had left Dundalk, where\nhe was poor, and, emigrating with his family to Australia, had landed\nat Adelaide. At first he engaged in mining, but soon relinquished\nthis for the less hazardous pursuits of the farmer, in which he had\nbeen successful beyond his highest anticipations. His agricultural\nknowledge was a great aid to him. He economized, and bought new lands\nwith the profits of the first. His family flourished, as well as his\nfarm. The Irish peasant had become a landed proprietor, and, although\nhis establishment was only two years old, he owned at that moment five\nhundred acres of well-cultivated land and five hundred head of cattle,\nwas his own master, and as independent as one can be even in the freest\ncountry in the world.\n\nHis guests congratulated him sincerely when his story was finished. He\ndoubtless expected a similar confidence, but did not urge it. Glenarvan\nhad an immediate interest in speaking of the Duncan, of his own\npresence at Cape Bernouilli, and of the search that they had pursued so\nperseveringly. But, like a man who considers the main object in view,\nhe first questioned his host concerning the shipwreck of the Britannia.\n\nThe Irishman's answer was not cheering. He had never heard of the\nship. No vessel had for some time been lost on the coast; and, as the\nshipwreck had occurred only two years before, he could affirm with\nabsolute certainty that the sailors had not been cast on that part of\nthe western shore.\n\n\"And now, my lord,\" added he, \"may I be allowed to ask why you have\ninquired of me concerning this shipwreck?\"\n\nGlenarvan then told the story of the document, the voyage of the\nDuncan, and the attempts made to find Captain Grant. He confessed that\nhis dearest hopes had been destroyed by Mr. O'Moore's discouraging\ninformation, and that he now despaired of ever finding the shipwrecked\nseamen of the Britannia.\n\nThese words produced a gloomy impression upon his hearers. Robert and\nMary listened to them with tearful eyes. Paganel could not find a word\nof consolation or hope. Captain Mangles suffered a grief that he could\nnot subdue. Despair was seizing upon the souls of the noble people whom\nthe Duncan had vainly brought to these distant shores, when all at once\na voice was heard:--\n\n\"My lord, praise and thank God! If Captain Grant is living, he is in\nAustralia.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI.\n\nTHE QUARTERMASTER OF THE BRITANNIA.\n\n\nThe astonishment that these words produced cannot be desc"}, {"chunk_id": 56, "text": "drink very much in use in South America. It is the Indian's tea,\nconsisting of a decoction of leaves dried in the fire, and is imbibed\nthrough a straw. At Paganel's request, Thalcave prepared several\ncups of this beverage, which very agreeably accompanied the ordinary\neatables, and was declared excellent.\n\n[Sidenote: A CHANGE FOR THE WORSE.]\n\nThe next day they resumed their journey towards the east. About noon\na change took place in the appearance of the Pampas, which could\nnot escape eyes wearied with its monotony. The grass became more and\nmore scanty, and gave place to sickly burdocks and gigantic thistles;\nwhile stunted nettles and other thorny shrubs grew here and there.\nHeretofore, a certain moisture, preserved by the clay of the prairie,\nfreshened the meadows; the vegetation was thick and luxuriant. But now\na patchy growth, bare in many places, exposed the earth, and indicated\nthe poverty of the soil. These signs of increasing dryness could not be\nmistaken, and Thalcave called attention to them.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"I am not sorry at this change,\" said Tom Austin; \"to see always grass,\nnothing but grass, becomes tiresome before long.\"\n\n\"But where there is grass there is water,\" replied the major.\n\n\"Oh, we are not in want,\" said Wilson, \"and shall find some river on\nour course.\"\n\nHowever, when Wilson said that the supply of water would not fail\nhe had not calculated for the unquenchable thirst that consumed his\ncompanions all that day; and, when he added that they would meet with\nsome stream in their journey he had anticipated too much. Indeed, not\nonly were rivers wanting, but even the artificial wells dug by the\nIndians were empty. On seeing these indications of dryness increase\nfrom mile to mile, Paganel asked Thalcave where he expected to find\nwater.\n\n\"At Lake Salinas,\" replied the Indian.\n\n\"And when shall we arrive there?\"\n\n\"To-morrow evening.\"\n\nThe natives ordinarily, when they travel on the Pampas, dig wells, and\nfind water a few feet below the surface; but the travelers, destitute\nof the necessary implements, could not employ this expedient. It was\ntherefore necessary to obtain a supply in some other way, for, if they\ndid not absolutely suffer from the tormenting desire for drink, no one\ncould entirely allay his thirst.\n\nAt evening they halted, after a journey of thirty miles. Every one\nrelied upon a good night to recruit himself after the fatigues of\nthe day; but they were greatly annoyed by a very persistent swarm of\nmosquitoes, which disappeared, however, after the wind changed.\n\nIf the major preserved his calmness in the midst of the petty\nannoyances of life, Paganel, on the contrary, could not treat the\nmatter so indifferently. He fought the mosquitoes, and sadly regretted\nthe absence of his acid-water, which would have soothed the pain of\ntheir bites. Although the major endeavored to console him, he awoke in\na very bad humor.\n\nHowever, he was very easily persuaded to set out at daybreak, for it\nwas important to arrive at Lake Salinas the same day. The horses were\nvery much exhausted: they were dying of thirst; and, although their\nriders had denied themselves on their account, still their share of\nwater had been very limited. The dryness was to-day even greater, and\nthe heat no less intolerable, with the dusty wind, the simoom of the\nPampas.\n\n[Sidenote: INDIANS AHEAD!]\n\nDuring the day the monotony of the journey was interrupted. Mulready,\nwho rode in advance, turned back, signaling the approach of a party of\nIndians. This meeting elicited different opinions. Glenarvan thought\nof the information that these natives might furnish concerning the\nshipwrecked seamen of the Britannia. Thalcave, for his part, scarcely\nenjoyed meeting in his journey the wandering Indians of the plains.\nHe considered them plunderers and robbers, and only sought to avoid\nthem. According to his orders, the little party collected together, and\nmade ready their fire-arms.

That is why I requested the\npresence of Mr. Paganel and Major MacNabb; for, properly speaking, this\nis a matter of business that I am going to propose to you.\"\n\nGlenarvan, who was accustomed to Ayrton's manners, betrayed no\nsurprise, although a matter of business between this man and himself\nseemed strange.\n\n[Illustration: \"Do you agree or not?\"]\n\n[Sidenote: BARGAINING FOR TERMS.]\n\n\"What is this business?\" said he.\n\n\"This is it,\" replied Ayrton. \"You desire to know from me certain\ncircumstances which may be useful to you. I desire to obtain from you\ncertain advantages which will be valuable to me. Now, I will make an\nexchange, my lord. Do you agree or not?\"\n\n\"What are these circumstances?\" asked Paganel, quickly.\n\n\"No,\" corrected Glenarvan: \"what are these advantages?\"\n\nAyrton bowed, showing that he understood the distinction.\n\n\"These,\" said he, \"are the advantages for which I petition. You\nstill intend, my lord, to deliver me into the hands of the English\nauthorities?\"\n\n\"Yes, Ayrton; it is only justice.\"\n\n\"I do not deny it,\" replied the quartermaster. \"You would not consent,\nthen, to set me at liberty?\"\n\nGlenarvan hesitated before answering a question so plainly asked.\nPerhaps the fate of Harry Grant depended upon what he was about to say.\nHowever, the feeling of duty towards humanity prevailed, and he said:\n\n\"No, Ayrton, I cannot set you at liberty.\"\n\n\"I do not ask it,\" replied the quartermaster, proudly.\n\n\"What do you wish, then?\"\n\n\"An intermediate fate, my lord, between that which you think awaits me\nand the liberty that you cannot grant me.\"\n\n\"And that is----?\"\n\n\"To abandon me on one of the desert islands of the Pacific, with the\nprincipal necessaries of life. I will manage as I can, and repent, if I\nhave time.\"\n\nGlenarvan, who was little prepared for this proposal, glanced at his\ntwo friends, who remained silent. After a few moments of reflection, he\nreplied:\n\n\"Ayrton, if I grant your request, will you tell me all that it is for\nmy interest to know?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord; that is to say, all that I know concerning Captain Grant\nand the Britannia.\"\n\n\"The whole truth?\"\n\n\"The whole.\"\n\n\"But who will warrant----?\"\n\n\"Oh, I see what troubles you, my lord. You do not like to trust to\nme,--to the word of a malefactor! That is right. But what can you do?\nThe situation is thus. You have only to accept or refuse.\"\n\n\"I will trust you, Ayrton,\" said Glenarvan, simply.\n\n\"And you will be right, my lord. Moreover, if I deceive you, you will\nalways have the power to revenge yourself.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"By recapturing me on this island, from which I shall not be able to\nescape.\"\n\nAyrton had a reply for everything. He met all difficulties, and\nproduced unanswerable arguments against himself. As was seen, he\nstrove to treat in his business with good faith. It was impossible for\na person to surrender with more perfect confidence, and yet he found\nmeans to advance still further in this disinterested course.\n\n\"My lord and gentlemen,\" added he, \"I desire that you should be\nconvinced that I am honorable. I do not seek to deceive you, but am\ngoing to give you a new proof of my sincerity in this affair. I act\nfrankly, because I rely upon your loyalty.\"\n\n\"Go on, Ayrton,\" replied Glenarvan.\n\n\"My lord, I have not yet your promise to agree to my proposition, and\nstill I do not hesitate to tell you that I know little concerning Harry\nGrant.\"\n\n\"Little!\" cried Glenarvan.\n\n\"Yes, my lord; the circumstances that I am able to communicate to\nyou are relative to myself. They are personal experiences, and will\nscarcely tend to put you on the track you have lost.\"\n\n[Sidenote: REVELATIONS AND DISCLOSURES.]\n\nA keen disappointment was manifest on the features of Glenarvan and\nthe major.

When this speech was arranged, Villefort\nturned to Dantès.\n\n0099m\n\n\n\n“Go on, sir,” said he.\n\n“What would you have me say?”\n\n“Give all the information in your power.”\n\n“Tell me on which point you desire information, and I will tell all I\nknow; only,” added he, with a smile, “I warn you I know very little.”\n\n“Have you served under the usurper?”\n\n“I was about to be mustered into the Royal Marines when he fell.”\n\n“It is reported your political opinions are extreme,” said Villefort,\nwho had never heard anything of the kind, but was not sorry to make\nthis inquiry, as if it were an accusation.\n\n“My political opinions!” replied Dantès. “Alas, sir, I never had any\nopinions. I am hardly nineteen; I know nothing; I have no part to play.\nIf I obtain the situation I desire, I shall owe it to M. Morrel. Thus\nall my opinions—I will not say public, but private—are confined to\nthese three sentiments,—I love my father, I respect M. Morrel, and I\nadore Mercédès. This, sir, is all I can tell you, and you see how\nuninteresting it is.” As Dantès spoke, Villefort gazed at his ingenuous\nand open countenance, and recollected the words of Renée, who, without\nknowing who the culprit was, had besought his indulgence for him. With\nthe deputy’s knowledge of crime and criminals, every word the young man\nuttered convinced him more and more of his innocence. This lad, for he\nwas scarcely a man,—simple, natural, eloquent with that eloquence of\nthe heart never found when sought for; full of affection for everybody,\nbecause he was happy, and because happiness renders even the wicked\ngood—extended his affection even to his judge, spite of Villefort’s\nsevere look and stern accent. Dantès seemed full of kindness.\n\n_“Pardieu!”_ said Villefort, “he is a noble fellow. I hope I shall gain\nRenée’s favor easily by obeying the first command she ever imposed on\nme. I shall have at least a pressure of the hand in public, and a sweet\nkiss in private.” Full of this idea, Villefort’s face became so joyous,\nthat when he turned to Dantès, the latter, who had watched the change\non his physiognomy, was smiling also.\n\n“Sir,” said Villefort, “have you any enemies, at least, that you know.”\n\n“I have enemies?” replied Dantès; “my position is not sufficiently\nelevated for that. As for my disposition, that is, perhaps, somewhat\ntoo hasty; but I have striven to repress it. I have had ten or twelve\nsailors under me, and if you question them, they will tell you that\nthey love and respect me, not as a father, for I am too young, but as\nan elder brother.”\n\n“But you may have excited jealousy. You are about to become captain at\nnineteen—an elevated post; you are about to marry a pretty girl, who\nloves you; and these two pieces of good fortune may have excited the\nenvy of someone.”\n\n“You are right; you know men better than I do, and what you say may\npossibly be the case, I confess; but if such persons are among my\nacquaintances I prefer not to know it, because then I should be forced\nto hate them.”\n\n“You are wrong; you should always strive to see clearly around you. You\nseem a worthy young man; I will depart from the strict line of my duty\nto aid you in discovering the author of this accusation. Here is the\npaper; do you know the writing?” As he spoke, Villefort drew the letter\nfrom his pocket, and presented it to Dantès. Dantès read it. A cloud\npassed over his brow as he said:"}, {"chunk_id": 61, "text": "But where is he? what is he\ndoing?

Believe me, we are as well informed as you, and\nour police are as good as your own. Would you like a proof of it? well,\nyou wished to conceal your journey from me, and yet I knew of your\narrival half an hour after you had passed the barrier.

Ring,\nthen, if you please, for a second knife, fork, and plate, and we will\ndine together.”\n\n“Indeed!” replied Villefort, looking at his father with astonishment,\n“you really do seem very well informed.”\n\n“Eh? the thing is simple enough. You who are in power have only the\nmeans that money produces—we who are in expectation, have those which\ndevotion prompts.”\n\n“Devotion!” said Villefort, with a sneer.\n\n“Yes, devotion; for that is, I believe, the phrase for hopeful\nambition.”\n\nAnd Villefort’s father extended his hand to the bell-rope, to summon\nthe servant whom his son had not called. Villefort caught his arm.\n\n“Wait, my dear father,” said the young man, “one word more.”\n\n“Say on.”\n\n“However stupid the royalist police may be, they do know one terrible\nthing.”\n\n“What is that?”\n\n“The description of the man who, on the morning of the day when General\nQuesnel disappeared, presented himself at his house.”\n\n“Oh, the admirable police have found that out, have they? And what may\nbe that description?”\n\n“Dark complexion; hair, eyebrows, and whiskers black; blue frock-coat,\nbuttoned up to the chin; rosette of an officer of the Legion of Honor\nin his button-hole; a hat with wide brim, and a cane.”\n\n“Ah, ha, that’s it, is it?” said Noirtier; “and why, then, have they\nnot laid hands on him?”\n\n“Because yesterday, or the day before, they lost sight of him at the\ncorner of the Rue Coq-Héron.”\n\n“Didn’t I say that your police were good for nothing?”\n\n“Yes; but they may catch him yet.”\n\n“True,” said Noirtier, looking carelessly around him, “true, if this\nperson were not on his guard, as he is;” and he added with a smile, “He\nwill consequently make a few changes in his personal appearance.” At\nthese words he rose, and put off his frock-coat and cravat, went\ntowards a table on which lay his son’s toilet articles, lathered his\nface, took a razor, and, with a firm hand, cut off the compromising\nwhiskers. Villefort watched him with alarm not devoid of admiration.\n\nHis whiskers cut off, Noirtier gave another turn to his hair; took,\ninstead of his black cravat, a colored neckerchief which lay at the top\nof an open portmanteau; put on, in lieu of his blue and high-buttoned\nfrock-coat, a coat of Villefort’s of dark brown, and cut away in front;\ntried on before the glass a narrow-brimmed hat of his son’s, which\nappeared to fit him perfectly, and, leaving his cane in the corner\nwhere he had deposited it, he took up a small bamboo switch, cut the\nair with it once or twice, and walked about with that easy swagger\nwhich was one of his principal characteristics.\n\n“Well,” he said, turning towards his wondering son, when this disguise\nwas completed, “well, do you think your police will recognize me now.”\n\n“No, father,” stammered Villefort; “at least, I hope not.”\n\n“And now, my dear boy,” continued Noirtier, “I rely on your prudence to\nremove all the things which I leave in your care.”\n\n“Oh, rely on me,” said Villefort.\n\n“Yes, yes; and now I believe you are right, and that you have really\nsaved my life; be assured I will return the favor hereafter.”\n\nVillefort shook his head.\n\n“You are not convinced yet?”\n\n“I hope at least, that you may be mistaken.”\n\n“Shall you see the king again?”\n\n“Perhaps.”\n\n“Would you pass in his eyes for a prophet?”\n\n“Prophets of evil are not in favo"}, {"chunk_id": 156, "text": "y.\nThe night after that battle he was sentry at the door of a general who\ncarried on a secret correspondence with the enemy. That same night the\ngeneral was to go over to the English. He proposed to Fernand to\naccompany him; Fernand agreed to do so, deserted his post, and followed\nthe general.\n\n“Fernand would have been court-martialed if Napoleon had remained on\nthe throne, but his action was rewarded by the Bourbons. He returned to\nFrance with the epaulet of sub-lieutenant, and as the protection of the\ngeneral, who is in the highest favor, was accorded to him, he was a\ncaptain in 1823, during the Spanish war—that is to say, at the time\nwhen Danglars made his early speculations. Fernand was a Spaniard, and\nbeing sent to Spain to ascertain the feeling of his fellow-countrymen,\nfound Danglars there, got on very intimate terms with him, won over the\nsupport of the royalists at the capital and in the provinces, received\npromises and made pledges on his own part, guided his regiment by paths\nknown to himself alone through the mountain gorges which were held by\nthe royalists, and, in fact, rendered such services in this brief\ncampaign that, after the taking of Trocadero, he was made colonel, and\nreceived the title of count and the cross of an officer of the Legion\nof Honor.”\n\n“Destiny! destiny!” murmured the abbé.\n\n“Yes, but listen: this was not all. The war with Spain being ended,\nFernand’s career was checked by the long peace which seemed likely to\nendure throughout Europe. Greece only had risen against Turkey, and had\nbegun her war of independence; all eyes were turned towards Athens—it\nwas the fashion to pity and support the Greeks. The French government,\nwithout protecting them openly, as you know, gave countenance to\nvolunteer assistance. Fernand sought and obtained leave to go and serve\nin Greece, still having his name kept on the army roll.\n\n0345m\n\n\n\nSome time after, it was stated that the Comte de Morcerf (this was the\nname he bore) had entered the service of Ali Pasha with the rank of\ninstructor-general. Ali Pasha was killed, as you know, but before he\ndied he recompensed the services of Fernand by leaving him a\nconsiderable sum, with which he returned to France, when he was\ngazetted lieutenant-general.”\n\n“So that now——?” inquired the abbé.\n\n“So that now,” continued Caderousse, “he owns a magnificent house—No.\n27, Rue du Helder, Paris.”\n\nThe abbé opened his mouth, hesitated for a moment, then, making an\neffort at self-control, he said, “And Mercédès—they tell me that she\nhas disappeared?”\n\n“Disappeared,” said Caderousse, “yes, as the sun disappears, to rise\nthe next day with still more splendor.”\n\n“Has she made a fortune also?” inquired the abbé, with an ironical\nsmile.\n\n“Mercédès is at this moment one of the greatest ladies in Paris,”\nreplied Caderousse.\n\n“Go on,” said the abbé; “it seems as if I were listening to the story\nof a dream. But I have seen things so extraordinary, that what you tell\nme seems less astonishing than it otherwise might.”\n\n“Mercédès was at first in the deepest despair at the blow which\ndeprived her of Edmond. I have told you of her attempts to propitiate\nM. de Villefort, her devotion to the elder Dantès. In the midst of her\ndespair, a new affliction overtook her. This was the departure of\nFernand—of Fernand, whose crime she did not know, and whom she regarded\nas her brother. Fernand went, and Mercédès remained alone.\n\n“Three months passed and still she wept—no news of Edmond, no news of\nFernand, no companionship save that of an old man who was dying with\ndespair.

At length the\nreading of the indictment was ended.\n\n“Accused,” said the president, “your name and surname?”\n\nAndrea arose.\n\n“Excuse me, Mr. President,” he said, in a clear voice, “but I see you\nare going to adopt a course of questions through which I cannot follow\nyou.

As for\nBenedetto, he gracefully wiped his lips with a fine cambric\npocket-handkerchief.\n\n“Your profession?”\n\n“First I was a forger,” answered Andrea, as calmly as possible; “then I\nbecame a thief, and lately have become an assassin.”\n\nA murmur, or rather storm, of indignation burst from all parts of the\nassembly. The judges themselves appeared to be stupefied, and the jury\nmanifested tokens of disgust for a cynicism so unexpected in a man of\nfashion. M. de Villefort pressed his hand upon his brow, which, at\nfirst pale, had become red and burning; then he suddenly arose and\nlooked around as though he had lost his senses—he wanted air.\n\n50183m\n\n\n\n“Are you looking for anything, Mr. Procureur?” asked Benedetto, with\nhis most ingratiating smile.\n\nM. de Villefort answered nothing, but sat, or rather threw himself down\nagain upon his chair.\n\n“And now, prisoner, will you consent to tell your name?” said the\npresident. “The brutal affectation with which you have enumerated and\nclassified your crimes calls for a severe reprimand on the part of the\ncourt, both in the name of morality, and for the respect due to\nhumanity. You appear to consider this a point of honor, and it may be\nfor this reason, that you have delayed acknowledging your name. You\nwished it to be preceded by all these titles.”\n\n“It is quite wonderful, Mr. President, how entirely you have read my\nthoughts,” said Benedetto, in his softest voice and most polite manner.\n“This is, indeed, the reason why I begged you to alter the order of the\nquestions.”\n\nThe public astonishment had reached its height. There was no longer any\ndeceit or bravado in the manner of the accused. The audience felt that\na startling revelation was to follow this ominous prelude.\n\n“Well,” said the president; “your name?”\n\n“I cannot tell you my name, since I do not know it; but I know my\nfather’s, and can tell it to you.”\n\nA painful giddiness overwhelmed Villefort; great drops of acrid sweat\nfell from his face upon the papers which he held in his convulsed hand.\n\n“Repeat your father’s name,” said the president.\n\nNot a whisper, not a breath, was heard in that vast assembly; everyone\nwaited anxiously.\n\n“My father is king’s attorney,” replied Andrea calmly.\n\n50179m\n\n\n\n“King’s attorney?” said the president, stupefied, and without noticing\nthe agitation which spread over the face of M"}, {"chunk_id": 582, "text": "o is preparing to defend his life proves his shield and bends\nhis sword.

He called for me at seven o’clock, and, before anyone\nhad arrived, asked one of the door-keepers to place me in a box. I was\nconcealed by a column, and might witness the whole of the terrible\nscene which was about to take place. At eight o’clock all were in their\nplaces, and M. de Morcerf entered at the last stroke. He held some\npapers in his hand; his countenance was calm, and his step firm, and he\nwas dressed with great care in his military uniform, which was buttoned\ncompletely up to the chin. His presence produced a good effect. The\ncommittee was made up of Liberals, several of whom came forward to\nshake hands with him.”\n\nAlbert felt his heart bursting at these particulars, but gratitude\nmingled with his sorrow: he would gladly have embraced those who had\ngiven his father this proof of esteem at a moment when his honor was so\npowerfully attacked.\n\n“At this moment one of the door-keepers brought in a letter for the\npresident. ‘You are at liberty to speak, M. de Morcerf,’ said the\npresident, as he unsealed the letter; and the count began his defence,\nI assure you, Albert, in a most eloquent and skilful manner. He\nproduced documents proving that the Vizier of Yanina had up to the last\nmoment honored him with his entire confidence, since he had interested\nhim with a negotiation of life and death with the emperor. He produced\nthe ring, his mark of authority, with which Ali Pasha generally sealed\nhis letters, and which the latter had given him, that he might, on his\nreturn at any hour of the day or night, gain access to the presence,\neven in the harem. Unfortunately, the negotiation failed, and when he\nreturned to defend his benefactor, he was dead. ‘But,’ said the count,\n‘so great was Ali Pasha’s confidence, that on his death-bed he resigned\nhis favorite mistress and her daughter to my care.’”\n\nAlbert started on hearing these words; the history of Haydée recurred\nto him, and he remembered what she had said of that message and the\nring, and the manner in which she had been sold and made a slave.\n\n“And what effect did this discourse produce?” anxiously inquired\nAlbert.\n\n“I acknowledge it affected me, and, indeed, all the committee also,”\nsaid Beauchamp.\n\n“Meanwhile, the president carelessly opened the letter which had been\nbrought to him; but the first lines aroused his attention; he read them\nagain and again, and fixing his eyes on M. de Morcerf, ‘Count,’ said\nhe, ‘you have said that the Vizier of Yanina confided his wife and\ndaughter to your care?’—‘Yes, sir,’ replied Morcerf; ‘but in that, like\nall the rest, misfortune pursued me. On my return, Vasiliki and her\ndaughter Haydée had disappeared.’—‘Did you know them?’—‘My intimacy\nwith the pasha and his unlimited confidence had gained me an\nintroduction to them, and I had seen them above twenty times.’\n\n“‘Have you any idea what became of them?’—‘Yes, sir; I heard they had\nfallen victims to their sorrow, and, perhaps, to their poverty. I was\nnot rich; my life was in constant danger; I could not seek them, to my\ngreat regret.’ The president frowned imperceptibly. ‘Gentlemen,’ said\nhe, ‘you have heard the Comte de Morcerf’s defence. Can you, sir,\nproduce any witnesses to the truth of what you have asserted?’—‘Alas,\nno, monsieur,’ replied the count; ‘all those who surrounded the vizier,\nor who knew me at his court, are either dead or gone away, I know not\nwhere.

But bear in mind, that should\nthere fall in your way anyone guilty of conspiring against the\ngovernment, you will be so much the more bound to visit the offence\nwith rigorous punishment, as it is known you belong to a suspected\nfamily.”\n\n“Alas, madame,” returned Villefort, “my profession, as well as the\ntimes in which we live, compels me to be severe. I have already\nsuccessfully conducted several public prosecutions, and brought the\noffenders to merited punishment. But we have not done with the thing\nyet.”\n\n0087m\n\n\n\n“Do you, indeed, think so?” inquired the marquise.\n\n“I am, at least, fearful of it. Napoleon, in the Island of Elba, is too\nnear France, and his proximity keeps up the hopes of his partisans.\nMarseilles is filled with half-pay officers, who are daily, under one\nfrivolous pretext or other, getting up quarrels with the royalists;\nfrom hence arise continual and fatal duels among the higher classes of\npersons, and assassinations in the lower.”\n\n“You have heard, perhaps,” said the Comte de Salvieux, one of M. de\nSaint-Méran’s oldest friends, and chamberlain to the Comte d’Artois,\n“that the Holy Alliance purpose removing him from thence?”\n\n“Yes; they were talking about it when we left Paris,” said M. de\nSaint-Méran; “and where is it decided to transfer him?”\n\n“To Saint Helena.”\n\n“For heaven’s sake, where is that?” asked the marquise.\n\n“An island situated on the other side of the equator, at least two\nthousand leagues from here,” replied the count.\n\n“So much the better. As Villefort observes, it is a great act of folly\nto have left such a man between Corsica, where he was born, and Naples,\nof which his brother-in-law is king, and face to face with Italy, the\nsovereignty of which he coveted for his son.”\n\n“Unfortunately,” said Villefort, “there are the treaties of 1814, and\nwe cannot molest Napoleon without breaking those compacts.”\n\n“Oh, well, we"}, {"chunk_id": 582, "text": "o is preparing to defend his life proves his shield and bends\nhis sword. He thought himself strong enough, for he mistook fever for\nenergy. “Go on,” said he.\n\n“The evening arrived; all Paris was in expectation. Many said your\nfather had only to show himself to crush the charge against him; many\nothers said he would not appear; while some asserted that they had seen\nhim start for Brussels; and others went to the police-office to inquire\nif he had taken out a passport. I used all my influence with one of the\ncommittee, a young peer of my acquaintance, to get admission to one of\nthe galleries. He called for me at seven o’clock, and, before anyone\nhad arrived, asked one of the door-keepers to place me in a box. I was\nconcealed by a column, and might witness the whole of the terrible\nscene which was about to take place. At eight o’clock all were in their\nplaces, and M. de Morcerf entered at the last stroke. He held some\npapers in his hand; his countenance was calm, and his step firm, and he\nwas dressed with great care in his military uniform, which was buttoned\ncompletely up to the chin. His presence produced a good effect. The\ncommittee was made up of Liberals, several of whom came forward to\nshake hands with him.”\n\nAlbert felt his heart bursting at these particulars, but gratitude\nmingled with his sorrow: he would gladly have embraced those who had\ngiven his father this proof of esteem at a moment when his honor was so\npowerfully attacked.\n\n“At this moment one of the door-keepers brought in a letter for the\npresident. ‘You are at liberty to speak, M. de Morcerf,’ said the\npresident, as he unsealed the letter; and the count began his defence,\nI assure you, Albert, in a most eloquent and skilful manner. He\nproduced documents proving that the Vizier of Yanina had up to the last\nmoment honored him with his entire confidence, since he had interested\nhim with a negotiation of life and death with the emperor. He produced\nthe ring, his mark of authority, with which Ali Pasha generally sealed\nhis letters, and which the latter had given him, that he might, on his\nreturn at any hour of the day or night, gain access to the presence,\neven in the harem. Unfortunately, the negotiation failed, and when he\nreturned to defend his benefactor, he was dead. ‘But,’ said the count,\n‘so great was Ali Pasha’s confidence, that on his death-bed he resigned\nhis favorite mistress and her daughter to my care.’”\n\nAlbert started on hearing these words; the history of Haydée recurred\nto him, and he remembered what she had said of that message and the\nring, and the manner in which she had been sold and made a slave.\n\n“And what effect did this discourse produce?” anxiously inquired\nAlbert.\n\n“I acknowledge it affected me, and, indeed, all the committee also,”\nsaid Beauchamp.\n\n“Meanwhile, the president carelessly opened the letter which had been\nbrought to him; but the first lines aroused his attention; he read them\nagain and again, and fixing his eyes on M. de Morcerf, ‘Count,’ said\nhe, ‘you have said that the Vizier of Yanina confided his wife and\ndaughter to your care?’—‘Yes, sir,’ replied Morcerf; ‘but in that, like\nall the rest, misfortune pursued me. On my return, Vasiliki and her\ndaughter Haydée had disappeared.’—‘Did you know them?’—‘My intimacy\nwith the pasha and his unlimited confidence had gained me an\nintroduction to them, and I had seen them above twenty times.’\n\n“‘Have you any idea what became of them?’—‘Yes, sir; I heard they had\nfallen victims to their sorrow, and, perhaps, to their poverty. I was\nnot rich; my life was in constant danger; I could not seek them, to my\ngreat regret.’ The president frowned imperceptibly. ‘Gentlemen,’ said\nhe, ‘you have heard the Comte de Morcerf’s defence. Can you, sir,\nproduce any witnesses to the truth of what you have asserted?’—‘Alas,\nno, monsieur,’ replied the count; ‘all those who surrounded the vizier,\nor who knew me at his court, are either dead or gone away, I know not\nwhere.

Noirtier was a true prophet, and things progressed rapidly, as he\nhad predicted. Everyone knows the history of the famous return from\nElba, a return which was unprecedented in the past, and will probably\nremain without a counterpart in the future.\n\nLouis XVIII. made but a faint attempt to parry this unexpected blow;\nthe monarchy he had scarcely reconstructed tottered on its precarious\nfoundation, and at a sign from the emperor the incongruous structure of\nancient prejudices and new ideas fell to the ground. Villefort,\ntherefore, gained nothing save the king’s gratitude (which was rather\nlikely to injure him at the present time) and the cross of the Legion\nof Honor, which he had the prudence not to wear, although M. de Blacas\nhad duly forwarded the brevet.\n\nNapoleon would, doubtless, have deprived Villefort of his office had it\nnot been for Noirtier, who was all powerful at court, and thus the\nGirondin of ’93 and the Senator of 1806 protected him who so lately had\nbeen his protector. All Villefort’s influence barely enabled him to\nstifle the secret Dantès had so nearly divulged. The king’s procureur\nalone was deprived of his office, being suspected of royalism.\n\nHowever, scarcely was the imperial power established—that is, scarcely\nhad the emperor re-entered the Tuileries and begun to issue orders from\nthe closet into which we have introduced our readers,—he found on the\ntable there Louis XVIII.’s half-filled snuff-box,—scarcely had this\noccurred when Marseilles began, in spite of the authorities, to\nrekindle the flames of civil war, always smouldering in the south, and\nit required but little to excite the populace to acts of far greater\nviolence than the shouts and insults with which they assailed the\nroyalists whenever they ventured abroad.\n\n0159m\n\n\n\nOwing to this change, the worthy shipowner became at that moment—we\nwill not say all powerful, because Morrel was a prudent and rather a\ntimid man, so much so, that many of the most zealous partisans of\nBonaparte accused him of “moderation”—but sufficiently influential to\nmake a demand in favor of Dantès.\n\nVillefort retained his place, but his marriage was put off until a more\nfavorable opportunity. If the emperor remained on the throne, Gérard\nrequired a different alliance to aid his career; if Louis XVIII.\nreturned, the influence of M. de Saint-Méran, like his own, could be\nvastly increased, and the marriage be still more suitable. The deputy\nprocureur was, therefore, the first magistrate of Marseilles, when one\nmorning his door opened, and M. Morrel was announced.\n\nAnyone else would have hastened to receive him; but Villefort was a man\nof ability, and he knew this would be a sign of weakness. He made\nMorrel wait in the antechamber, although he had no one with him, for\nthe simple reason that the king’s procureur always makes everyone wait,\nand after passing a quarter of an hour in reading the papers, he\nordered M. Morrel to be admitted.\n\nMorrel expected Villefort would be dejected; he found him as he had\nfound him six weeks before, calm, firm, and full of that glacial\npoliteness, that most insurmountable barrier which separates the\nwell-bred from the vulgar man.\n\nHe had entered Villefort’s office expecting that the magistrate would\ntremble at the sight of him; on the contrary, he felt a cold shudder\nall over him when he saw Villefort sitting there with his elbow on his\ndesk, and his head leaning on his hand. He stopped at the door;\nVillefort gazed at him as if he had some difficulty in recognizing him;\nthen, after a brief interval, during which the honest shipowner turned\nhis hat in his hands,\n\n“M. Morrel, I believe?” said Villefort.\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“Come nearer,” said the magistrate, with a patronizing wave of the\nhand, “and tell me to what circumstance I owe the honor of this visit.”\n\n“Do you not guess, monsieur?” asked Morrel.\n\n“Not in the least; but if I can serve you in any way I shall be\ndelighted.”\n"}, {"chunk_id": 270, "text": "ust\ngo to the Chamber, for our life is not an idle one.”\n\n“You only breakfast; I await two persons, and the instant they arrive\nwe shall sit down to table.”\n\n\n\n Chapter 40. The Breakfast\n\nAnd what sort of persons do you expect to breakfast?” said Beauchamp.\n\n“A gentleman, and a diplomatist.”\n\n“Then we shall have to wait two hours for the gentleman, and three for\nthe diplomatist. I shall come back to dessert; keep me some\nstrawberries, coffee, and cigars. I shall take a cutlet on my way to\nthe Chamber.”\n\n“Do not do anything of the sort; for were the gentleman a Montmorency,\nand the diplomatist a Metternich, we will breakfast at eleven; in the\nmeantime, follow Debray’s example, and take a glass of sherry and a\nbiscuit.”\n\n“Be it so; I will stay; I must do something to distract my thoughts.”\n\n“You are like Debray, and yet it seems to me that when the minister is\nout of spirits, the opposition ought to be joyous.”\n\n“Ah, you do not know with what I am threatened. I shall hear this\nmorning that M. Danglars make a speech at the Chamber of Deputies, and\nat his wife’s this evening I shall hear the tragedy of a peer of\nFrance. The devil take the constitutional government, and since we had\nour choice, as they say, at least, how could we choose that?”\n\n“I understand; you must lay in a stock of hilarity.”\n\n“Do not run down M. Danglars’ speeches,” said Debray; “he votes for\nyou, for he belongs to the opposition.”\n\n“_Pardieu_, that is exactly the worst of all. I am waiting until you\nsend him to speak at the Luxembourg, to laugh at my ease.”\n\n“My dear friend,” said Albert to Beauchamp, “it is plain that the\naffairs of Spain are settled, for you are most desperately out of humor\nthis morning. Recollect that Parisian gossip has spoken of a marriage\nbetween myself and Mlle. Eugénie Danglars; I cannot in conscience,\ntherefore, let you run down the speeches of a man who will one day say\nto me, ‘Vicomte, you know I give my daughter two millions.’”\n\n“Ah, this marriage will never take place,” said Beauchamp. “The king\nhas made him a baron, and can make him a peer, but he cannot make him a\ngentleman, and the Count of Morcerf is too aristocratic to consent, for\nthe paltry sum of two million francs, to a _mésalliance_. The Viscount\nof Morcerf can only wed a marchioness.”\n\n“But two million francs make a nice little sum,” replied Morcerf.\n\n“It is the social capital of a theatre on the boulevard, or a railroad\nfrom the Jardin des Plantes to La Râpée.”\n\n“Never mind what he says, Morcerf,” said Debray, “do you marry her. You\nmarry a money-bag label, it is true; well, but what does that matter?\nIt is better to have a blazon less and a figure more on it. You have\nseven martlets on your arms; give three to your wife, and you will\nstill have four; that is one more than M. de Guise had, who so nearly\nbecame King of France, and whose cousin was Emperor of Germany.”\n\n“On my word, I think you are right, Lucien,” said Albert absently.\n\n“To be sure; besides, every millionaire is as noble as a bastard—that\nis, he can be.”\n\n“Do not say that, Debray,” returned Beauchamp, laughing, “for here is\nChâteau-Renaud, who, to cure you of your mania for paradoxes, will pass\nthe sword of Renaud de Montauban, his ancestor, through your body.”\n\n“He will sully it then,” returned Lucien; “for I am low—very low.”\n\n“Oh, heavens,” cried Beauchamp, “the minister quotes Béranger, what\nshall we come to next?”\n\n“M. de Château-Renaud—M. Maximilian Morrel,” said the servant,\nannouncing two fresh guests.\n\n“Now, then, to breakfast,” said Beauchamp; “for, if I remember, you\ntold me you only expected two persons, Albert.”\n\n“Morrel,” muttered Albert—“Morrel—who is he?”\n\nBut before he had finished, M. de Château-Renaud, a handsome young man\nof thirty, gentleman all over,—that is, with the figure of a Guiche and\nthe wit of a Mortemart,—took Albert’s hand.\n\n“My dear Albert,” said he, “let me introduce to you M.

The note indicated\nneither the street nor the number of the house where the meeting was to\nbe held; it bore no signature, but it announced to the general that\nsomeone would call for him if he would be ready at nine o’clock. The\nmeetings were always held from that time till midnight. At nine o’clock\nthe president of the club presented himself; the general was ready, the\npresident informed him that one of the conditions of his introduction\nwas that he should be eternally ignorant of the place of meeting, and\nthat he would allow his eyes to be bandaged, swearing that he would not\nendeavor to take off the bandage. General de Quesnel accepted the\ncondition, and promised on his honor not to seek to discover the road\nthey took. The general’s carriage was ready, but the president told him\nit was impossible for him to use it, since it was useless to blindfold\nthe master if the coachman knew through what streets he went. “What\nmust be done then?” asked the general.—“I have my carriage here,” said\nthe president.\n\n“‘“Have you, then, so much confidence in your servant that you can\nintrust him with a secret you will not allow me to know?”\n\n“‘“Our coachman is a member of the club,” said the president; “we shall\nbe driven by a State-Councillor.”\n\n“‘“Then we run another risk,” said the general, laughing, “that of\nbeing upset.” We insert this joke to prove that the general was not in\nthe least compelled to attend the meeting, but that he came willingly.\nWhen they were seated in the carriage the president reminded the\ngeneral of his promise to allow his eyes to be bandaged, to which he\nmade no opposition. On the road the president thought he saw the\ngeneral make an attempt to remove the handkerchief, and reminded him of\nhis oath. “Sure enough,” said the general. The carriage stopped at an\nalley leading out of the Rue Saint-Jacques. The general alighted,\nleaning on the arm of the president, of whose dignity he was not aware,\nconsidering him simply as a member of the club; they went through the\nalley, mounted a flight of stairs, and entered the assembly-room.\n\n“‘The deliberations had already begun. The members, apprised of the\nsort of presentation which was to be made that evening, were all in\nattendance. When in the middle of the room the general was invited to\nremove his bandage, he did so immediately, and was surprised to see so\nmany well-known faces in a society of whose existence he had till then\nbeen ignorant. They questioned him as to his sentiments, but he\ncontented himself with answering, that the letters from the Island of\nElba ought to have informed them——’”\n\nFranz interrupted himself by saying, “My father was a royalist; they\nneed not have asked his sentiments, which were well known.”\n\n“And hence,” said Villefort, “arose my affection for your father, my\ndear M. Franz. Opinions held in common are a ready bond of union.”\n\n“Read again,” said the old man.\n\nFranz continued:\n\n“‘The president then sought to make him speak more explicitly, but M.\nde Quesnel replied that he wished first to know what they wanted with\nhim. He was then informed of the contents of the letter from the Island\nof Elba, in which he was recommended to the club as a man who would be\nlikely to advance the interests of their party. One paragraph spoke of\nthe return of Bonaparte and promised another letter and further\ndetails, on the arrival of the _Pharaon_ belonging to the shipbuilder\nMorrel, of Marseilles, whose captain was entirely devoted to the\nemperor. During all this time, the general, on whom they thought to\nhave relied as on a brother, manifested evidently signs of discontent\nand repugnance.

General Quesnel, it appears, had just\nleft a Bonapartist club when he disappeared. An unknown person had been\nwith him that morning, and made an appointment with him in the Rue\nSaint-Jacques; unfortunately, the general’s valet, who was dressing his\nhair at the moment when the stranger entered, heard the street\nmentioned, but did not catch the number.” As the police minister\nrelated this to the king, Villefort, who looked as if his very life\nhung on the speaker’s lips, turned alternately red and pale. The king\nlooked towards him.\n\n“Do you not think with me, M. de Villefort, that General Quesnel, whom\nthey believed attached to the usurper, but who was really entirely\ndevoted to me, has perished the victim of a Bonapartist ambush?”\n\n“It is probable, sire,” replied Villefort. “But is this all that is\nknown?”\n\n“They are on the track of the man who appointed the meeting with him.”\n\n“On his track?” said Villefort.\n\n“Yes, the servant has given his description. He is a man of from fifty\nto fifty-two years of age, dark, with black eyes covered with shaggy\neyebrows, and a thick moustache. He was dressed in a blue frock-coat,\nbuttoned up to the chin, and wore at his button-hole the rosette of an\nofficer of the Legion of Honor. Yesterday a person exactly\ncorresponding with this description was followed, but he was lost sight\nof at the corner of the Rue de la Jussienne and the Rue Coq-Héron.”\nVillefort leaned on the back of an armchair, for as the minister of\npolice went on speaking he felt his legs bend under him; but when he\nlearned that the unknown had escaped the vigilance of the agent who\nfollowed him, he breathed again.\n\n“Continue to seek for this man, sir,” said the king to the minister of\npolice; “for if, as I am all but convinced, General Quesnel, who would\nhave been so useful to us at this moment, has been murdered, his\nassassins, Bonapartists or not, shall be cruelly punished.” It required\nall Villefort’s coolness not to betray the terror with which this\ndeclaration of the king inspired him.\n\n“How strange,” continued the king, with some asperity; “the police\nthink that they have disposed of the whole matter when they say, ‘A\nmurder has been committed,’ and especially so when they can add, ‘And\nwe are on the track of the guilty persons.’”\n\n“Sire, your majesty will, I trust, be amply satisfied on this point at\nleast.”\n\n“We shall see. I will no longer detain you, M. de Villefort, for you\nmust be fatigued after so long a journey; go and rest. Of course you\nstopped at your father’s?” A feeling of faintness came over Villefort.\n\n0145m\n\n\n\n“No, sire,” he replied, “I alighted at the Hotel de Madrid, in the Rue\nde Tournon.”\n\n“But you have seen him?”\n\n“Sire, I went straight to the Duc de Blacas.”\n\n“But you will see him, then?”\n\n“I think not, sire.”\n\n“Ah, I forgot,” said Louis, smiling in a manner which proved that all\nthese questions were not made without a motive; “I forgot you and M.\nNoirtier are not on the best terms possible, and that is another\nsacrifice made to the royal cause, and for which you should be\nrecompensed.”\n\n“Sire, the kindness your majesty deigns to evince towards me is a\nrecompense which so far surpasses my utmost ambition that I have\nnothing more to ask for.”\n\n“Never mind, sir, we will not forget you; make your mind easy.

While working night and day, I\nsometimes lose all recollection of the past, and then I experience the\nsame sort of happiness I can imagine the dead feel; still, it is better\nthan suffering.”\n\n“But, sir, he has fled; let him escape—inaction is a pardonable\noffence.”\n\n“I tell you it is too late; early this morning the telegraph was\nemployed, and at this very minute——”\n\n“Sir,” said the valet de chambre, entering the room, “a dragoon has\nbrought this despatch from the Minister of the Interior.”\n\nVillefort seized the letter, and hastily broke the seal. Madame\nDanglars trembled with fear; Villefort started with joy.\n\n“Arrested!” he exclaimed; “he was taken at Compiègne, and all is over.”\n\nMadame Danglars rose from her seat, pale and cold.\n\n“Adieu, sir,” she said.\n\n“Adieu, madame,” replied the king’s attorney, as in an almost joyful\nmanner he conducted her to the door. Then, turning to his desk, he\nsaid, striking the letter with the back of his right hand:\n\n“Come, I had a forgery, three robberies, and two cases of arson, I only\nwanted a murder, and here it is. It will be a splendid session!”\n\n\n\n Chapter 100. The Apparition\n\nAs the procureur had told Madame Danglars, Valentine was not yet\nrecovered. Bowed down with fatigue, she was indeed confined to her bed;\nand it was in her own room, and from the lips of Madame de Villefort,\nthat she heard all the strange events we have related; we mean the\nflight of Eugénie and the arrest of Andrea Cavalcanti, or rather\nBenedetto, together with the accusation of murder pronounced against\nhim. But Valentine was so weak that this recital scarcely produced the\nsame effect it would have done had she been in her usual state of\nhealth. Indeed, her brain was only the seat of vague ideas, and\nconfused forms, mingled with strange fancies, alone presented\nthemselves before her eyes.\n\nDuring the daytime Valentine’s perceptions remained tolerably clear,\nowing to the constant presence of M. Noirtier, who caused himself to be\ncarried to his granddaughter’s room, and watched her with his paternal\ntenderness; Villefort also, on his return from the law courts,\nfrequently passed an hour or two with his father and child.\n\nAt six o’clock Villefort retired to his study, at eight M. d’Avrigny\nhimself arrived, bringing the night draught prepared for the young\ngirl, and then M. Noirtier was carried away. A nurse of the doctor’s\nchoice succeeded them, and never left till about ten or eleven o’clock,\nwhen Valentine was asleep. As she went downstairs she gave the keys of\nValentine’s room to M. de Villefort, so that no one could reach the\nsick-room excepting through that of Madame de Villefort and little\nEdward.\n\nEvery morning Morrel called on Noirtier to receive news of Valentine,\nand, extraordinary as it seemed, each day found him less uneasy.\nCertainly, though Valentine still labored under dreadful nervous\nexcitement, she was better; and moreover, Monte Cristo had told him\nwhen, half distracted, he had rushed to the count’s house, that if she\nwere not dead in two hours she would be saved. Now four days had\nelapsed, and Valentine still lived.\n\nThe nervous excitement of which we speak pursued Valentine even in her\nsleep, or rather in that state of somnolence which succeeded her waking\nhours; it was then, in the silence of night, in the dim light shed from\nthe alabaster lamp on the chimney-piece, that she saw the shadows pass\nand repass which hover over the bed of sickness, and fan the fever with\ntheir trembling wings. First she fancied she saw her stepmother\nthreatening her, then Morrel stretched his arms towards her; sometimes\nmere strangers, like the Count of Monte Cristo came to visit her; even\nthe very furniture, in thes"}, {"chunk_id": 510, "text": "thrown into the river\nafter ascertaining that he was dead.

The\nnames have been purposely concealed; my father himself does not know\nwho this president was, and if he knows, he cannot tell you; proper\nnames are not in the dictionary.”\n\n“Oh, misery,” cried Franz: “the only hope which sustained me and\nenabled me to read to the end was that of knowing, at least, the name\nof him who killed my father! Sir, sir,” cried he, turning to Noirtier,\n“do what you can—make me understand in some way!”\n\n“Yes,” replied Noirtier.\n\n“Oh, mademoiselle, mademoiselle!” cried Franz, “your grandfather says\nhe can indicate the person. Help me,—lend me your assistance!”\n\nNoirtier looked at the dictionary. Franz took it with a nervous\ntrembling, and repeated the letters of the alphabet successively, until\nhe came to M. At that letter the old man signified “Yes.”\n\n“M,” repeated Franz. The young man’s finger, glided over the words, but\nat each one Noirtier answered by a negative sign. Valentine hid her\nhead between her hands. At length, Franz arrived at the word MYSELF.\n\n40046m\n\n\n\n“Yes!”\n\n“You!” cried Franz, whose hair stood on end; “you, M. Noirtier—you\nkilled my father?”\n\n“Yes!” replied Noirtier, fixing a majestic look on the young man.

Cavalcanti the elder had returned to his service, not in\nthe army of his majesty the Emperor of Austria, but at the gaming-table\nof the baths of Lucca, of which he was one of the most assiduous\ncourtiers. He had spent every farthing that had been allowed for his\njourney as a reward for the majestic and solemn manner in which he had\nmaintained his assumed character of father.\n\nM. Andrea at his departure inherited all the papers which proved that\nhe had indeed the honor of being the son of the Marquis Bartolomeo and\nthe Marchioness Oliva Corsinari. He was now fairly launched in that\nParisian society which gives such ready access to foreigners, and\ntreats them, not as they really are, but as they wish to be considered.\nBesides, what is required of a young man in Paris? To speak its\nlanguage tolerably, to make a good appearance, to be a good gamester,\nand to pay in cash. They are certainly less particular with a foreigner\nthan with a Frenchman.

Noirtier was a true prophet, and things progressed rapidly, as he\nhad predicted. Everyone knows the history of the famous return from\nElba, a return which was unprecedented in the past, and will probably\nremain without a counterpart in the future.\n\nLouis XVIII. made but a faint attempt to parry this unexpected blow;\nthe monarchy he had scarcely reconstructed tottered on its precarious\nfoundation, and at a sign from the emperor the incongruous structure of\nancient prejudices and new ideas fell to the ground. Villefort,\ntherefore, gained nothing save the king’s gratitude (which was rather\nlikely to injure him at the present time) and the cross of the Legion\nof Honor, which he had the prudence not to wear, although M. de Blacas\nhad duly forwarded the brevet.\n\nNapoleon would, doubtless, have deprived Villefort of his office had it\nnot been for Noirtier, who was all powerful at court, and thus the\nGirondin of ’93 and the Senator of 1806 protected him who so lately had\nbeen his protector. All Villefort’s influence barely enabled him to\nstifle the secret Dantès had so nearly divulged. The king’s procureur\nalone was deprived of his office, being suspected of royalism.\n\nHowever, scarcely was the imperial power established—that is, scarcely\nhad the emperor re-entered the Tuileries and begun to issue orders from\nthe closet into which we have introduced our readers,—he found on the\ntable there Louis XVIII.’s half-filled snuff-box,—scarcely had this\noccurred when Marseilles began, in spite of the authorities, to\nrekindle the flames of civil war, always smouldering in the south, and\nit required but little to excite the populace to acts of far greater\nviolence than the shouts and insults with which they assailed the\nroyalists whenever they ventured abroad.\n\n0159m\n\n\n\nOwing to this change, the worthy shipowner became at that moment—we\nwill not say all powerful, because Morrel was a prudent and rather a\ntimid man, so much so, that many of the most zealous partisans of\nBonaparte accused him of “moderation”—but sufficiently influential to\nmake a demand in favor of Dantès.\n\nVillefort retained his place, but his marriage was put off until a more\nfavorable opportunity. If the emperor remained on the throne, Gérard\nrequired a different alliance to aid his career; if Louis XVIII.\nreturned, the influence of M. de Saint-Méran, like his own, could be\nvastly increased, and the marriage be still more suitable. The deputy\nprocureur was, therefore, the first magistrate of Marseilles, when one\nmorning his door opened, and M. Morrel was announced.\n\nAnyone else would have hastened to receive him; but Villefort was a man\nof ability, and he knew this would be a sign of weakness. He made\nMorrel wait in the antechamber, although he had no one with him, for\nthe simple reason that the king’s procureur always makes everyone wait,\nand after passing a quarter of an hour in reading the papers, he\nordered M. Morrel to be admitted.\n\nMorrel expected Villefort would be dejected; he found him as he had\nfound him six weeks before, calm, firm, and full of that glacial\npoliteness, that most insurmountable barrier which separates the\nwell-bred from the vulgar man.\n\nHe had entered Villefort’s office expecting that the magistrate would\ntremble at the sight of him; on the contrary, he felt a cold shudder\nall over him when he saw Villefort sitting there with his elbow on his\ndesk, and his head leaning on his hand. He stopped at the door;\nVillefort gazed at him as if he had some difficulty in recognizing him;\nthen, after a brief interval, during which the honest shipowner turned\nhis hat in his hands,\n\n“M. Morrel, I believe?” said Villefort.\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“Come nearer,” said the magistrate, with a patronizing wave of the\nhand, “and tell me to what circumstance I owe the honor of this visit.”\n\n“Do you not guess, monsieur?” asked Morrel.\n\n“Not in the least; but if I can serve you in any way I shall be\ndelighted.”\n"}, {"chunk_id": 31, "text": "hus called up; “but bear in mind, if you\nplease, that our respective parents underwent persecution and\nproscription from diametrically opposite principles; in proof of which\nI may remark, that while my family remained among the staunchest\nadherents of the exiled princes, your father lost no time in joining\nthe new government; and that while the Citizen Noirtier was a Girondin,\nthe Count Noirtier became a senator.”\n\n“Dear mother,” interposed Renée, “you know very well it was agreed that\nall these disagreeable reminiscences should forever be laid aside.”\n\n“Suffer me, also, madame,” replied Villefort, “to add my earnest\nrequest to Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran’s, that you will kindly allow\nthe veil of oblivion to cover and conceal the past. What avails\nrecrimination over matters wholly past recall? For my own part, I have\nlaid aside even the name of my father, and altogether disown his\npolitical principles. He was—nay, probably may still be—a Bonapartist,\nand is called Noirtier; I, on the contrary, am a staunch royalist, and\nstyle myself de Villefort. Let what may remain of revolutionary sap\nexhaust itself and die away with the old trunk, and condescend only to\nregard the young shoot which has started up at a distance from the\nparent tree, without having the power, any more than the wish, to\nseparate entirely from the stock from which it sprung.”\n\n“Bravo, Villefort!” cried the marquis; “excellently well said! Come,\nnow, I have hopes of obtaining what I have been for years endeavoring\nto persuade the marquise to promise; namely, a perfect amnesty and\nforgetfulness of the past.”\n\n“With all my heart,” replied the marquise; “let the past be forever\nforgotten. I promise you it affords _me_ as little pleasure to revive\nit as it does you. All I ask is, that Villefort will be firm and\ninflexible for the future in his political principles. Remember, also,\nVillefort, that we have pledged ourselves to his majesty for your\nfealty and strict loyalty, and that at our recommendation the king\nconsented to forget the past, as I do” (and here she extended to him\nher hand)—“as I now do at your entreaty. But bear in mind, that should\nthere fall in your way anyone guilty of conspiring against the\ngovernment, you will be so much the more bound to visit the offence\nwith rigorous punishment, as it is known you belong to a suspected\nfamily.”\n\n“Alas, madame,” returned Villefort, “my profession, as well as the\ntimes in which we live, compels me to be severe. I have already\nsuccessfully conducted several public prosecutions, and brought the\noffenders to merited punishment. But we have not done with the thing\nyet.”\n\n0087m\n\n\n\n“Do you, indeed, think so?” inquired the marquise.\n\n“I am, at least, fearful of it. Napoleon, in the Island of Elba, is too\nnear France, and his proximity keeps up the hopes of his partisans.\nMarseilles is filled with half-pay officers, who are daily, under one\nfrivolous pretext or other, getting up quarrels with the royalists;\nfrom hence arise continual and fatal duels among the higher classes of\npersons, and assassinations in the lower.”\n\n“You have heard, perhaps,” said the Comte de Salvieux, one of M. de\nSaint-Méran’s oldest friends, and chamberlain to the Comte d’Artois,\n“that the Holy Alliance purpose removing him from thence?”\n\n“Yes; they were talking about it when we left Paris,” said M. de\nSaint-Méran; “and where is it decided to transfer him?”\n\n“To Saint Helena.”\n\n“For heaven’s sake, where is that?” asked the marquise.\n\n“An island situated on the other side of the equator, at least two\nthousand leagues from here,” replied the count.\n\n“So much the better. As Villefort observes, it is a great act of folly\nto have left such a man between Corsica, where he was born, and Naples,\nof which his brother-in-law is king, and face to face with Italy, the\nsovereignty of which he coveted for his son.”\n\n“Unfortunately,” said Villefort, “there are the treaties of 1814, and\nwe cannot molest Napoleon without breaking those compacts.”\n\n“Oh, well, we"}]}

Then the king, who,\nwithout our suspecting it, had overheard our conversation, interrupted\nus by saying, ‘Villefort’—observe that the king did not pronounce the\nword Noirtier, but, on the contrary, placed considerable emphasis on\nthat of Villefort—‘Villefort,’ said his majesty, ‘is a young man of\ngreat judgment and discretion, who will be sure to make a figure in his\nprofession; I like him much, and it gave me great pleasure to hear that\nhe was about to become the son-in-law of the Marquis and Marquise de\nSaint-Méran. I should myself have recommended the match, had not the\nnoble marquis anticipated my wishes by requesting my consent to it.’”\n\n“Is it possible the king could have condescended so far as to express\nhimself so favorably of me?” asked the enraptured Villefort.\n\n“I give you his very words; and if the marquis chooses to be candid, he\nwill confess that they perfectly agree with what his majesty said to\nhim, when he went six months ago to consult him upon the subject of\nyour espousing his daughter.”\n\n0091m\n\n\n\n“That is true,” answered the marquis.\n\n“How much do I owe this gracious prince! What is there I would not do\nto evince my earnest gratitude!”\n\n“That is right,” cried the marquise. “I love to see you thus. Now,\nthen, were a conspirator to fall into your hands, he would be most\nwelcome.”\n\n“For my part, dear mother,” interposed Renée, “I trust your wishes will\nnot prosper, and that Providence will only permit petty offenders, poor\ndebtors, and miserable cheats to fall into M. de Villefort’s\nhands,—then I shall be contented.”\n\n“Just the same as though you prayed that a physician might only be\ncalled upon to prescribe for headaches, measles, and the stings of\nwasps, or any other slight affection of the epidermis. If you wish to\nsee me the king’s attorney, you must desire for me some of those\nviolent and dangerous diseases from the cure of which so much honor\nredounds to the physician.”\n\nAt this moment, and as though the utterance of Villefort’s wish had\nsufficed to effect its accomplishment, a servant entered the room, and\nwhispered a few words in his ear. Villefort immediately rose from table\nand quitted the room upon the plea of urgent business; he soon,\nhowever, returned, his whole face beaming with delight. Renée regarded\nhim with fond affection; and certainly his handsome features, lit up as\nthey then were with more than usual fire and animation, seemed formed\nto excite the innocent admiration with which she gazed on her graceful\nand intelligent lover.\n\n“You were wishing just now,” said Villefort, addressing her, “that I\nwere a doctor instead of a lawyer. Well, I at least resemble the\ndisciples of Esculapius in one thing [people spoke in this style in\n1815], that of not being able to call a day my own, not even that of my\nbetrothal.”\n\n“And wherefore were you called away just now?” asked Mademoiselle de\nSaint-Méran, with an air of deep interest.\n\n“For a very serious matter, which bids fair to make work for the\nexecutioner.”\n\n“How dreadful!” exclaimed Renée, turning pale.\n\n“Is it possible?” burst simultaneously from all who were near enough to\nthe magistrate to hear his words.\n\n“Why, if my information prove correct, a sort of Bonapartist conspiracy\nhas just been discovered.”\n\n“Can I believe my ears?” cried the marquise.\n\n“I will read you the letter containing the accusation, at least,” said\nVillefort:\n\n“‘The king’s attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and the\nreligious institutions of his country, that one named Edmond Dantès,\nmate of the ship _Pharaon_, this day arrived from Smyrna, after having\ntouched at Naples and Porto-Ferrajo, has been the bearer of a letter\nfrom Mur"}, {"chunk_id": 448, "text": ", it signifies nothing to me so long as you\npay for your lessons out of your own cash box.

Either the\ndiplomatist must give his lessons gratis, and I will tolerate him, or\nhe must never set his foot again in my house;—do you understand,\nmadame?”\n\n“Oh, this is too much,” cried Hermine, choking, “you are worse than\ndespicable.”\n\n“But,” continued Danglars, “I find you did not even pause there——”\n\n“Insults!”\n\n“You are right; let us leave these facts alone, and reason coolly. I\nhave never interfered in your affairs excepting for your good; treat me\nin the same way. You say you have nothing to do with my cash box. Be it\nso. Do as you like with your own, but do not fill or empty mine.\nBesides, how do I know that this was not a political trick, that the\nminister enraged at seeing me in the opposition, and jealous of the\npopular sympathy I excite, has not concerted with M. Debray to ruin\nme?”\n\n“A probable thing!”\n\n“Why not? Who ever heard of such an occurrence as this?—a false\ntelegraphic despatch—it is almost impossible for wrong signals to be\nmade as they were in the last two telegrams. It was done on purpose for\nme—I am sure of it.”\n\n“Sir,” said the baroness humbly, “are you not aware that the man\nemployed there was dismissed, that they talked of going to law with\nhim, that orders were issued to arrest him and that this order would\nhave been put into execution if he had not escaped by flight, which\nproves that he was either mad or guilty? It was a mistake.”\n\n“Yes, which made fools laugh, which caused the minister to have a\nsleepless night, which has caused the minister’s secretaries to blacken\nseveral sheets of paper, but which has cost me 700,000 francs.”\n\n“But, sir,” said Hermine suddenly, “if all this is, as you say, caused\nby M. Debray, why, instead of going direct to him, do you come and tell\nme of it? Why, to accuse the man, do you address the woman?”\n\n“Do I know M.

No; you do all\nthis, not I.”\n\n“Still it seems to me, that as you profit by it——”\n\nDanglars shrugged his shoulders. “Foolish creature,” he exclaimed.\n“Women fancy they have talent because they have managed two or three\nintrigues without being the talk of Paris! But know that if you had\neven hidden your irregularities from your husband, who has but the\ncommencement of the art—for generally husbands _will_ not see—you would\nthen have been but a faint imitation of most of your friends among the\nwomen of the world. But it has not been so with me,—I see, and always\nhave seen, during the last sixteen years. You may, perhaps, have hidden\na thought; but not a step, not an action, not a fault, has escaped me,\nwhile you flattered yourself upon your address, and firmly believed you\nhad deceived me. What has been the result?—that, thanks to my pretended\nignorance, there is none of your friends, from M. de Villefort to M.\nDebray, who has not trembled before me. There is not one who has not\ntreated me as the master of the house,—the only title I desire with\nrespect to you; there is not one, in fact, who would have dared to\nspeak of me as I have spoken of them this day. I will allow you to make\nme hateful, but I will prevent your rendering me ridiculous, and, above\nall, I forbid you to ruin me.”\n\nThe baroness had been tolerably composed until the name of Villefort\nhad been pronounced; but then she became pale, and, rising, as if\ntouched by a spring, she stretched out her hands as though conjuring an\napparition; she then took two or three steps towards her husband, as\nthough to tear the secret from him, of which he was ignorant, or which\nhe withheld from some odious calculation,—odious, as all his\ncalculations were.\n\n“M. de Villefort!—What do you mean?”\n\n“I mean that M. de Nargonne, your first husband, being neither a\nphilos"}, {"chunk_id": 69, "text": "ertainly; but you will find terrible charges.”\n\n“Monsieur,” continued Dantès, “I know it is not in your power to\nrelease me; but you can plead for me—you can have me tried—and that is\nall I ask.

The door closed; but\nthis time a fresh inmate was left with Dantès—Hope.\n\n0173m\n\n\n\n“Will you see the register at once,” asked the governor, “or proceed to\nthe other cell?”\n\n“Let us visit them all,” said the inspector. “If I once went up those\nstairs. I should never have the courage to come down again.”\n\n“Ah, this one is not like the other, and his madness is less affecting\nthan this one’s display of reason.”\n\n“What is his folly?”\n\n“He fancies he possesses an immense treasure. The first year he offered\ngovernment a million of francs for his release; the second, two; the\nthird, three; and so on progressively. He is now in his fifth year of\ncaptivity; he will ask to speak to you in private, and offer you five\nmillions.”\n\n“How curious!—what is his name?”\n\n“The Abbé Faria.”\n\n“No. 27,” said the inspector.\n\n“It is here; unlock the door, Antoine.”\n\nThe turnkey obeyed, and the inspector gazed curiously into the chamber\nof the _mad abbé_, as the prisoner was usually called.\n\nIn the centre of the cell, in a circle traced with a fragment of\nplaster detached from the wall, sat a man whose tattered garments\nscarcely covered him. He was drawing in this circle geometrical lines,\nand seemed as much absorbed in his problem as Archimedes was when the\nsoldier of Marcellus slew him. He did not move at the sound of the\ndoor, and continued his calculations until the flash of the torches\nlighted up with an unwonted glare the sombre walls of his cell; then,\nraising his head, he perceived with astonishment the number of persons\npresent. He hastily seized the coverlet of his bed, and wrapped it\nround him.\n\n“What is it you want?” said the inspector.\n\n“I, monsieur,” replied the abbé with an air of surprise,—“I want\nnothing.”\n\n“You do not understand,” continued the inspector; “I am sent here by\ngovernment to visit the prison, and hear the requests of the\nprisoners.”\n\n“Oh, that is different,” cried the abbé; “and we shall understand each\nother, I hope.”\n\n“There, now,” whispered the governor, “it is just as I told you.”\n\n“Monsieur,” continued the prisoner, “I am the Abbé Faria, born at Rome.\nI was for twenty years Cardinal Spada’s secretary; I was arrested, why,\nI know not, toward the beginning of the year 1811; since then I have\ndemanded my liberty from the Italian and French government.”\n\n“Why from the French government?”\n\n“Because I was arrested at Piombino, and I presume that, like Milan and\nFlorence, Piombino has become the capital of some French department.”\n\n“Ah,” said the inspector, “you have not the latest news from Italy?”\n\n“My information dates from the day on which I was arrested,” returned\nthe Abbé Faria; “and as the emperor had created the kingdom of Rome for\nhis infant son, I presume that he has realized the dream of Machiavelli\nand Cæsar Borgia, which was to make Italy a united kingdom.”\n\n“Monsieur,” returned the inspector, “Providence has changed this\ngigantic plan you advocate so "}, {"chunk_id": 60, "text": "hat, sir—I save you.”\n\n“You do? Why, really, the thing becomes more and more dramatic—explain\nyourself.”\n\n“I must refer again to the club in the Rue Saint-Jacques.”\n\n“It appears that this club is rather a bore to the police. Why didn’t\nthey search more vigilantly? they would have found——”\n\n“They have not found; but they are on the track.”\n\n“Yes, that the usual phrase; I am quite familiar with it. When the\npolice is at fault, it declares that it is on the track; and the\ngovernment patiently awaits the day when it comes to say, with a\nsneaking air, that the track is lost.”\n\n“Yes, but they have found a corpse; the general has been killed, and in\nall countries they call that a murder.”\n\n“A murder do you call it? why, there is nothing to prove that the\ngeneral was murdered. People are found every day in the Seine, having\nthrown themselves in, or having been drowned from not knowing how to\nswim.”\n\n“Father, you know very well that the general was not a man to drown\nhimself in despair, and people do not bathe in the Seine in the month\nof January. No, no, do not be deceived; this was murder in every sense\nof the word.”\n\n“And who thus designated it?”\n\n“The king himself.”\n\n“The king! I thought he was philosopher enough to allow that there was\nno murder in politics. In politics, my dear fellow, you know, as well\nas I do, there are no men, but ideas—no feelings, but interests; in\npolitics we do not kill a man, we only remove an obstacle, that is all.\nWould you like to know how matters have progressed? Well, I will tell\nyou. It was thought reliance might be placed in General Quesnel; he was\nrecommended to us from the Island of Elba; one of us went to him, and\ninvited him to the Rue Saint-Jacques, where he would find some friends.\nHe came there, and the plan was unfolded to him for leaving Elba, the\nprojected landing, etc. When he had heard and comprehended all to the\nfullest extent, he replied that he was a royalist. Then all looked at\neach other,—he was made to take an oath, and did so, but with such an\nill grace that it was really tempting Providence to swear thus, and\nyet, in spite of that, the general was allowed to depart free—perfectly\nfree. Yet he did not return home. What could that mean? why, my dear\nfellow, that on leaving us he lost his way, that’s all. A murder?\nreally, Villefort, you surprise me. You, a deputy procureur, to found\nan accusation on such bad premises! Did I ever say to you, when you\nwere fulfilling your character as a royalist, and cut off the head of\none of my party, ‘My son, you have committed a murder?’ No, I said,\n‘Very well, sir, you have gained the victory; tomorrow, perchance, it\nwill be our turn.’”\n\n“But, father, take care; when our turn comes, our revenge will be\nsweeping.”\n\n“I do not understand you.”\n\n“You rely on the usurper’s return?”\n\n“We do.”\n\n“You are mistaken; he will not advance two leagues into the interior of\nFrance without being followed, tracked, and caught like a wild beast.”\n\n“My dear fellow, the emperor is at this moment on the way to Grenoble;\non the 10th or 12th he will be at Lyons, and on the 20th or 25th at\nParis.”\n\n“The people will rise.”\n\n“Yes, to go and meet him.”\n\n“He has but a handful of men with him, and armies will be despatched\nagainst him.”\n\n“Yes, to escort him into the capital. Really, my dear Gérard, you are\nbut a child; you think yourself well informed because the telegraph has\ntold you, three days after the landing, ‘The usurper has landed at\nCannes with several men. He is pursued.’ But where is he? what is he\ndoing? You do not know at all, and in this way they will chase him to\nParis, without drawing a trigger.”\n\n“Grenoble and Lyons are faithful cities, and will oppose to him an\nimpassable barrier.”\n\n“Grenoble will open her gates to him with enthusiasm—all Lyons will\nhasten to welcome him.

M. de Villefort, who examined him attentively, and who no\ndoubt practiced upon him all the psychological studies he was\naccustomed to use, in vain endeavored to make him lower his eyes,\nnotwithstanding the depth and profundity of his gaze. At length the\nreading of the indictment was ended.\n\n“Accused,” said the president, “your name and surname?”\n\nAndrea arose.\n\n“Excuse me, Mr. President,” he said, in a clear voice, “but I see you\nare going to adopt a course of questions through which I cannot follow\nyou. I have an idea, which I will explain by and by, of making an\nexception to the usual form of accusation. Allow me, then, if you\nplease, to answer in different order, or I will not do so at all.”\n\nThe astonished president looked at the jury, who in turn looked at\nVillefort. The whole assembly manifested great surprise, but Andrea\nappeared quite unmoved.\n\n“Your age?” said the president; “will you answer that question?”\n\n“I will answer that question, as well as the rest, Mr. President, but\nin its turn.”\n\n“Your age?” repeated the president.\n\n“I am twenty-one years old, or rather I shall be in a few days, as I\nwas born the night of the 27th of September, 1817.”\n\nM. de Villefort, who was busy taking down some notes, raised his head\nat the mention of this date.\n\n“Where were you born?” continued the president.\n\n“At Auteuil, near Paris.”\n\nM. de Villefort a second time raised his head, looked at Benedetto as\nif he had been gazing at the head of Medusa, and became livid. As for\nBenedetto, he gracefully wiped his lips with a fine cambric\npocket-handkerchief.\n\n“Your profession?”\n\n“First I was a forger,” answered Andrea, as calmly as possible; “then I\nbecame a thief, and lately have become an assassin.”\n\nA murmur, or rather storm, of indignation burst from all parts of the\nassembly. The judges themselves appeared to be stupefied, and the jury\nmanifested tokens of disgust for a cynicism so unexpected in a man of\nfashion. M. de Villefort pressed his hand upon his brow, which, at\nfirst pale, had become red and burning; then he suddenly arose and\nlooked around as though he had lost his senses—he wanted air.\n\n50183m\n\n\n\n“Are you looking for anything, Mr. Procureur?” asked Benedetto, with\nhis most ingratiating smile.\n\nM. de Villefort answered nothing, but sat, or rather threw himself down\nagain upon his chair.\n\n“And now, prisoner, will you consent to tell your name?” said the\npresident. “The brutal affectation with which you have enumerated and\nclassified your crimes calls for a severe reprimand on the part of the\ncourt, both in the name of morality, and for the respect due to\nhumanity. You appear to consider this a point of honor, and it may be\nfor this reason, that you have delayed acknowledging your name.

He reflected, smiled, and replied to me by\na Sicilian proverb, which I believe is also a French proverb, ‘My son,\nthe world was not made in a day—but in seven. Return on Sunday.’ On the\nSunday following I did return to him. Instead of having watered his\ncabbage with arsenic, he had watered it this time with a solution of\nsalts, having their basis in strychnine, _strychnos colubrina_, as the\nlearned term it. Now, the cabbage had not the slightest appearance of\ndisease in the world, and the rabbit had not the smallest distrust;\nyet, five minutes afterwards, the rabbit was dead. The fowl pecked at\nthe rabbit, and the next day was a dead hen. This time we were the\nvultures; so we opened the bird, and this time all special symptoms had\ndisappeared, there were only general symptoms. There was no peculiar\nindication in any organ—an excitement of the nervous system—that was\nit; a case of cerebral congestion—nothing more. The fowl had not been\npoisoned—she had died of apoplexy. Apoplexy is a rare disease among\nfowls, I believe, but very common among men.”\n\nMadame de Villefort appeared more and more thoughtful.\n\n“It is very fortunate,” she observed, “that such substances could only\nbe prepared by chemists; otherwise, all the world would be poisoning\neach other.”\n\n“By chemists and persons who have a taste for chemistry,” said Monte\nCristo carelessly.\n\n“And then,” said Madame de Villefort, endeavoring by a struggle, and\nwith effort, to get away from her thoughts, “however skilfully it is\nprepared, crime is always crime, and if it avoid human scrutiny, it\ndoes not escape the eye of God. The Orientals are stronger than we are\nin cases of conscience, and, very prudently, have no hell—that is the\npoint.”\n\n30075m\n\n\n\n“Really, madame, this is a scruple which naturally must occur to a pure\nmind like yours, but which would easily yield before sound reasoning.\nThe bad side of human thought will always be defined by the paradox of\nJean Jacques Rousseau,—you remember,—the mandarin who is killed five\nhundred leagues off by raising the tip of the finger. Man’s whole life\npasses in doing these things, and his intellect is exhausted by\nreflecting on them. You will find very few persons who will go and\nbrutally thrust a knife in the heart of a fellow-creature, or will\nadminister to him, in order to remove him from the surface of the globe\non which we move with life and animation, that quantity of arsenic of\nwhich we just now talked. Such a thing is really out of rule—eccentric\nor stupid.

If\nwe ever escape together, half this treasure is yours; if I die here,\nand you escape alone, the whole belongs to you.”\n\n“But,” inquired Dantès hesitating, “has this treasure no more\nlegitimate possessor in the world than ourselves?”\n\n“No, no, be easy on that score; the family is extinct. The last Count\nof Spada, moreover, made me his heir, bequeathing to me this symbolic\nbreviary, he bequeathed to me all it contained; no, no, make your mind\nsatisfied on that point.

Then he pressed the hand the\nbaroness reluctantly gave him, and led her respectfully back to the\ndoor. Madame Danglars returned in another cab to the passage, on the\nother side of which she found her carriage, and her coachman sleeping\npeacefully on his box while waiting for her.\n\n\n\n Chapter 68. A Summer Ball\n\nThe same day during the interview between Madame Danglars and the\nprocureur, a travelling-carriage entered the Rue du Helder, passed\nthrough the gateway of No. 27, and stopped in the yard. In a moment the\ndoor was opened, and Madame de Morcerf alighted, leaning on her son’s\narm. Albert soon left her, ordered his horses, and having arranged his\ntoilet, drove to the Champs-Élysées, to the house of Monte Cristo.\n\nThe count received him with his habitual smile. It was a strange thing\nthat no one ever appeared to advance a step in that man’s favor. Those\nwho would, as it were, force a passage to his heart, found an\nimpassable barrier. Morcerf, who ran towards him with open arms, was\nchilled as he drew near, in spite of the friendly smile, and simply\nheld out his hand. Monte Cristo shook it coldly, according to his\ninvariable practice.\n\n“Here I am, dear count.”\n\n“Welcome home again.”\n\n“I arrived an hour since.”\n\n“From Dieppe?”\n\n“No, from Tréport.”\n\n“Indeed?”\n\n“And I have come at once to see you.”\n\n“That is extremely kind of you,” said Monte Cristo with a tone of\nperfect indifference.\n\n“And what is the news?”\n\n“You should not ask a stranger, a foreigner, for news.”\n\n“I know it, but in asking for news, I mean, have you done anything for\nme?”\n\n“Had you commissioned me?” said Monte Cristo, feigning uneasiness.\n\n“Come, come,” said Albert, “do not assume so much indifference. It is\nsaid, sympathy travels rapidly, and when at Tréport, I felt the\nelectric shock; you have either been working for me or thinking of me.”\n\n“Possibly,” said Monte Cristo, “I have indeed thought of you, but the\nmagnetic wire I was guiding acted, indeed, without my knowledge.”\n\n30277m\n\n\n\n“Indeed!

Twenty-four years ago I returned, proud and\njoyful, to my country. I had a betrothed, Albert, a lovely girl whom I\nadored, and I was bringing to my betrothed a hundred and fifty louis,\npainfully amassed by ceaseless toil. This money was for her; I destined\nit for her, and, knowing the treachery of the sea I buried our treasure\nin the little garden of the house my father lived in at Marseilles, on\nthe Allées de Meilhan. Your mother, Albert, knows that poor house well.\nA short time since I passed through Marseilles, and went to see the old\nplace, which revived so many painful recollections; and in the evening\nI took a spade and dug in the corner of the garden where I had\nconcealed my treasure. The iron box was there—no one had touched\nit—under a beautiful fig-tree my father had planted the day I was born,\nwhich overshadowed the spot. Well, Albert, this money, which was\nformerly designed to promote the comfort and tranquillity of the woman\nI adored, may now, through strange and painful circumstances, be\ndevoted to the same purpose.\n\n“Oh, feel for me, who could offer millions to that poor woman, but who\nreturn her only the piece of black bread forgotten under my poor roof\nsince the day I was torn from her I loved. You are a generous man,\nAlbert, but perhaps you may be blinded by pride or resentment; if you\nrefuse me, if you ask another for what I have a right to offer you, I\nwill say it is ungenerous of you to refuse the life of your mother at\nthe hands of a man whose father was allowed by your father to die in\nall the horrors of poverty and despair.”\n\nAlbert stood pale and motionless to hear what his mother would decide\nafter she had finished reading this letter. Mercédès turned her eyes\nwith an ineffable look towards heaven.\n\n“I accept it,” said she; “he has a right to pay the dowry, which I\nshall take with me to some convent!”\n\nPutting the letter in her bosom, she took her son’s arm, and with a\nfirmer step than she even herself expected she went downstairs.\n\n\n\n Chapter 92.

Emmanuel did not conceal his joy\nat the peaceful termination of the affair, and was loud in his\nexpressions of delight. Morrel, in a corner of the carriage, allowed\nhis brother-in-law’s gayety to expend itself in words, while he felt\nequal inward joy, which, however, betrayed itself only in his\ncountenance.\n\nAt the Barrière du Trône they met Bertuccio, who was waiting there,\nmotionless as a sentinel at his post. Monte Cristo put his head out of\nthe window, exchanged a few words with him in a low tone, and the\nsteward disappeared.\n\n“Count,” said Emmanuel, when they were at the end of the Place Royale,\n“put me down at my door, that my wife may not have a single moment of\nneedless anxiety on my account or yours.”\n\n“If it were not ridiculous to make a display of our triumph, said\nMorrel, I would invite the count to our house; besides that, he\ndoubtless has some trembling heart to comfort.

She\ncut the Tropic of Capricorn, and her prow was headed toward the strait\nof the celebrated geographer. Now and then the low shores of Patagonia\nwere seen, but like an almost invisible line on the horizon. They\nsailed along the coast for more than ten miles, but Paganel's famous\ntelescope gave him only a vague idea of these American shores.\n\nThe vessel soon found herself at the head of the strait, and entered\nwithout hesitation. This way is generally preferred by steam-vessels\nbound for the Pacific. Its exact length is three hundred and\nseventy-six miles. Ships of the greatest tonnage can always find deep\nwater, even near its shores, an excellent bottom, and many springs of\nwater. The rivers abound in fish, the forest in game, there are safe\nand easy landings at twenty places, and, in short, a thousand resources\nthat are wanting in the Strait of Lemaire, and off the terrible rocks\nof Cape Horn, which are continually visited by storms and tempests.\n\n[Illustration: Sometimes the tips of her yards would graze the branches\nof the beeches that hung over the waves.]\n\nDuring the first hours of the passage, till you reach Cape Gregory,\nthe shores are low and sandy. The entire passage lasted scarcely\nthirty-six hours, and this moving panorama of the two shores well\nrewarded the pains the geographer took to admire it under the radiant\nbeams of the southern sun. No inhabitant appeared on the shores of the\ncontinent; and only a few Fuegians wandered along the barren rocks of\nTerra del Fuego.\n\nAt one moment the Duncan rounded the peninsula of Brunswick between\ntwo magnificent sights. Just here the strait cuts between stupendous\nmasses of granite. The base of the mountains was hidden in the heart\nof immense forests, while their summits, whitened with eternal snow,\nwere lost in the clouds. Towards the southeast Mount Taru towered\nsix thousand five hundred feet aloft. Night came, preceded by a long\ntwilight, the light melting away insensibly by gentle degrees, while\nthe sky was studded with brilliant stars.\n\nIn the midst of this partial obscurity, the yacht boldly continued on\nher course, without casting anchor in the safe bays with which the\nshores abound. Sometimes the tips of her yards would graze the branches\nof the beeches that hung over the waves. At others her propeller would\nbeat the waters of the great rivers, starting geese, ducks, snipe,\nteal, and all the feathered tribes of the marshes. Soon deserted ruins\nappeared, and fallen monuments, to which the night lent a grand aspect;\nthese were the mournful remains of an abandoned colony, whose name\nwill be an eternal contradiction to the fertility of the coasts and\nthe rich game of the forests. It was Port Famine, the place that the\nSpaniard Sarmiento colonized in 1581 with four hundred emigrants. Here\nhe founded the city of San Felipe. But the extreme severity of the cold\nweakened the colony; famine devoured those whom the winter had spared,\nand in 1587 the explorer Cavendish found the last of these four hundred\nunfortunates dying of hunger amid the ruins of a city only six years in\nexistence.\n\n[Sidenote: CHEERLESS MEMORIES.]\n\nThe vessel coasted along these deserted shores. At daybreak she sailed\nin the midst of the narrow passes, between beeches, ash-trees, and\nbirches, from the bosom of which emerged ivy-clad domes, cupolas\ntapestried with the hardy holly, and lofty spires, among which the\nobelisk of Buckland rose to a great height. Far out in the sea sported\ndroves of seals and whales of great size, judging by their spouting,\nwhich could be seen at a distance of four miles. At last they doubled\nCape Froward, still bristling with the ices of winter. On the other\nside of the strait, on Terra del Fuego, rose Mount Sarmiento to the\nheight of six thousand feet, an enormous mass of rock broken by bands\nof clouds which formed as it were an aerial archipelago in the sky.\n\n[Illustration"}, {"chunk_id": 24, "text": " situation of\naffairs, and learned, not without emotion, the providential discovery\nof the documents, the story of Captain Grant, and Lady Helena's\ngenerous proposal.\n\n\"Madam,\" said he, \"permit me to admire your conduct in all this, and to\nadmire it without reserve.

Everything has been said and\nwritten about it; and it is, moreover, rapidly declining in point of\ncivilization. If, then, it is all the same to you, let us land at the\nCanaries.\"\n\n\"Very well, at the Canaries,\" replied Glenarvan. \"That will not take us\nout of our way.\"\n\n\"I know it, my dear lord. At the Canaries, you see, there are three\ngroups to study, not to speak of the Peak of Teneriffe, which I have\nalways desired to see. This is a fine opportunity. I will profit by\nit; and, while waiting for a vessel, will attempt the ascent of this\ncelebrated mountain.\"\n\n\"As you please, my dear Paganel,\" replied Glenarvan, who could not help\nsmiling, and with good reason.\n\nThe Canaries are only a short distance from Madeira, scarcely two\nhundred and fifty miles, a mere trifle for so good a vessel as the\nDuncan.\n\nThe same day, at two o'clock in the afternoon, Captain Mangles and\nPaganel were walking on the deck. The Frenchman pressed his companion\nwith lively questions concerning Chili. All at once the captain\ninterrupted him, and pointing towards the southern horizon, said,--\n\n\"Mr. Paganel!\"\n\n\"My dear captain,\" replied the geographer.\n\n\"Please cast your eyes in"}, {"chunk_id": 31, "text": "ght to make known by means\nof this bottle the place of their captivity.\"\n\n\"Simply, my dear Paganel, because to throw a bottle into the sea it is\nnecessary, at least, that the sea should be before you.\"\n\n\"Or, in the absence of the sea,\" added Paganel, \"the rivers which flow\ninto it.\"\n\nAn astonished silence followed this unexpected, yet reasonable, answer.\nBy the flash that brightened the eyes of his hearers Paganel knew that\neach of them had conceived a new hope. Lady Helena was the first to\nresume the conversation.\n\n\"What an idea!\" she exclaimed.\n\n\"What a _good_ idea!\" added the geographer, simply.\n\n\"Your advice then?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"My advice is to find the thirty-seventh parallel, just where it meets\nthe American coast, and follow it, without deviating half a degree, to\nthe point where it strikes the Atlantic. Perhaps we shall find on its\ncourse the survivors of the Britannia.\"\n\n\"A feeble chance,\" replied the major.\n\n\"However feeble it may be,\" continued Paganel, \"we ought not to neglect\nit. If I am right that this bottle reached the sea by following the\ncurrent of a river, we cannot fail to come upon the traces of the\nprisoners. Look, my friends, look at the map of this country, and I\nwill convince you beyond a doubt.\"\n\n[Sidenote: NIL DESPERANDUM!]\n\nSo saying, Paganel spread out before them upon the table a large map of\nChili and the Argentine Provinces. \"Look,\" said he, \"and follow me in\nthis passage across the American continent. Let us pass over the narrow\nstrip of Chili and the Cordilleras of the Andes, and descend into the\nmidst of the Pampas. Are rivers, streams, water-courses, wanting in\nthese regions? No. Here are the Rio Negro, the Rio Colorado, and their\naffluents, cut by the thirty-seventh parallel, all of which might have\nserved to transport the document. There, perhaps, in the midst of a\ntribe, in the hands of settled Indians, on the shores of these unknown\nrivers, in the gorges of the sierras, those whom I have the right to\ncall our friends are awaiting an interposition of Providence. Ought\nwe, then, to disappoint their hopes? Do you not think we should follow\nacross these countries an unswerving course? And if, contrary to all\nexpectation, I am still mistaken, is it not our duty to trace this\nparallel to the very end, and, if necessary, make upon it the tour of\nthe world?\"\n\nThese words, spoken with a noble enthusiasm, excited a deep emotion\namong Paganel's hearers. All rose to shake hands with him.\n\n\"Yes, my father is there!\" cried Robert Grant, devouring the map with\nhis eyes.\n\n\"And wherever he is,\" replied Glenarvan, \"we shall find him, my child.\nNothing is more consistent than our friend Paganel's interpretation,\nand we must follow without hesitation the course he has indicated.\nEither Captain Grant is in the hands of countless Indians, or is\nprisoner in a feeble tribe. In the latter case, we will rescue him. In\nthe former, after ascertaining his situation, we will join the Duncan\non the eastern coast, sail to Buenos Ayres, and with a detachment,\norganized by the major, can overcome all the Indians of the Argentine\nPlains.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, your lordship,\" answered Captain Mangles; \"and I will add\nthat this passage of the continent will be without peril.\"\n\n\"Without peril, or fatigue,\" continued Paganel. \"How many have already\naccomplished it who had scarcely our means for success, and whose\ncourage was not sustained by the grandeur of the undertaking!\"\n\n\"Sir, sir,\" exclaimed Mary Grant, in a voice broken with emotion, \"how\ncan I thank a devotion that exposes you to so many dangers?\"\n\n\"Dangers!\" cried Paganel. \"Who uttered the word _danger_?\"\n\n\"Not I!\" replied Robert Grant, with flashing eye and determined look.\n\n\"Danger!\" repeated Paganel; \"does such a thing exist? Moreover, what is\nthe question? A journey of scarcely three hundred and fifty leagues,\nsince we shall proceed in a straight line; a journey which will be\naccomplished in a favorable latitude and climate; in short, a journey\nwhose duration will be"}, {"chunk_id": 22, "text": "o converse with you.\"\n\n\"You arrived on board this vessel the day before yesterday?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord, day before yesterday, at eight o'clock in the evening.\nI took a cab from the Caledonian Railway to the Scotia, in which I had\nengaged cabin number six at Paris.

Captain Burton----\"\n\n\"I am not Captain Burton,\" replied John Mangles.\n\n\"But the Scotia?\"\n\n\"This vessel is not the Scotia.\"\n\nPaganel's amazement cannot be depicted. He looked first at Lord\nGlenarvan, always serious; then at Lady Helena and Miss Grant, whose\nfeatures expressed a sympathetic disappointment; and finally at Captain\nMangles, who was smiling, and the imperturbable major. Then, raising\nhis shoulders and drawing down his glasses from his forehead to his\neyes, he exclaimed,--\n\n\"What a joke!\"\n\nBut at that his eyes fell upon the steering wheel, on which were\ninscribed these two words, thus:\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"The Duncan! the Duncan!\" he cried in a tone of real despair; and,\nleaping down the companion-way, he rushed to his cabin.\n\nWhen the unfortunate geographer had disappeared, no one on board,\nexcept the major, could retain gravity, and the laugh was communicated\neven to the sailors. To mistake the railroad was not so bad; to take\nthe train to Dumbarton, instead of Edinburgh, would do. But to mistake\nthe vessel, and be sailing to Chili, when he wished to go to India, was\nthe height of absent-mindedness.\n\n[Sidenote: ABSENT-MINDEDNESS.]\n\n\"On the whole, I am not astonished at this on the part of Jacques\nPaganel,\" said Glenarvan; \"he is noted for such blunders. He once\npublished a celebrated "}, {"chunk_id": 51, "text": " Paganel, he did not leave the Indian. He became Thalcave's\nshadow, and could not remain quiet in the presence of a real\nPatagonian, in comparison with whom he would have passed for a dwarf.\nHe overwhelmed the grave Indian with Spanish phrases, to which the\nlatter quietly listened. The geographer studied this time without a\nbook, and was often heard repeating words aloud.\n\n\"If I do not get the accent,\" said he to the major, \"you must not be\nangry with me. Who would have thought that one day a Patagonian would\nteach me Spanish!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\nNEWS OF THE LOST CAPTAIN.\n\n\nAt eight o'clock the next morning Thalcave gave the signal for\ndeparture. The slope was gradual, and the travelers had only to descend\na gentle declivity to the sea.\n\nWhen the Patagonian declined the horse that Glenarvan offered him, the\nlatter thought that he preferred to go on foot, according to the custom\nof certain guides; and indeed, his long legs ought to have made walking\neasy. But he was mistaken.\n\nAt the moment of departure Thalcave whistled in a peculiar manner.\nImmediately a magnificent Argentine horse, of superb form, issued from\na small wood near by, and approached at the call of his master. The\nanimal was perfectly beautiful. His brown color indicated a sound,\nspirited and courageous beast. He had a small and elegantly poised\nhead, widely opening nostrils, a fiery eye, large hams, swelling\nwithers, broad breast, long pasterns, in short, all the qualities that\nconstitute strength and suppleness. The major, like a perfect horseman,\nadmired unreservedly this specimen of the horses of the plains. This\nbeautiful creature was called Thaouka, which means \"bird\" in the\nPatagonian language, and he justly merited this appellation.\n\n[Sidenote: A FRESH START.]\n\nWhen Thalcave was in the saddle, the horse pranced with spirited grace,\nand the Patagonian, a skillful rider, was magnificent to behold. His\noutfit comprised two weapons of the chase, the \"bolas\" and the lasso.\nThe bolas consists of three balls tied together by a leathern string,\nwhich are fastened to the front of the saddle. The Indians frequently\nthrow them the distance of a hundred paces at the animal or enemy that\nthey are pursuing, and with such precision that they twist about their\nlegs and bring them to the ground. It is, therefore, in their hands a\nformidable instrument, and they handle it with surprising dexterity.\nThe lasso, on the contrary, does not leave the hand that wields it. It\nconsists simply of a leathern thong thirty feet in length, terminating\nin a slip-noose which works upon an iron ring. The right hand throws\nthe slip-noose, while the left hand holds the remainder of the lasso,\nthe end of which is firmly tied to the saddle. A long carbine in a\nsling completed the Patagonian's armament.\n\nThalcave, without observing the admiration caused by his natural\ngrace, ease and courage, took the lead, and the party advanced, now\nat a gallop, and now at a walk, for their horses seemed entirely\nunaccustomed to trotting. Robert mounted with much boldness, and\nspeedily convinced Glenarvan of his ability to keep his seat.\n\nOn issuing from the gorges of the Andes, they encountered a great\nnumber of sand-ridges, called \"medanos,\" real waves incessantly\nagitated by the wind, when the roots of the herbage did not confine\nthem to the earth. This sand is of an extreme fineness; and, at the\nleast breath, they saw it float away in light clouds, or form regular\nsand-columns which rose to a considerable height. This spectacle caused\npleasure as well as annoyance to the eyes. Pleasure, for nothing was\nmore curious than these columns, wandering over the plain, struggling,\nmingling, sinking and rising in inexpressible confusion; and annoyance,\nsince an impalpable dust emanated from these innumerable medanos and\npenetrated the eyelids, however tightly they were closed.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThis phenomenon continued during a great part of the day.

Lady Helena regretted that\nshe could not have shaken hands with the brave Indian. MacNabb, after\nthe first outbursts of enthusiasm, repaired to his cabin to shave\nhimself. As for Paganel, he flitted hither and thither, like a bee,\nextracting the honey of compliments and smiles. He wished to embrace\nall on board the Duncan, and, beginning with Lady Helena and Mary\nGrant, ended with Mr. Olbinett, the steward, who could not better\nrecognize such politeness than by announcing breakfast.\n\n\"Breakfast!\" cried Paganel.\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Paganel,\" replied Olbinett.\n\n\"A real breakfast, on a real table, with table-cloth and napkins?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"And shall we not eat hard eggs, or ostrich steaks?\"\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Paganel!\" replied the worthy steward, greatly embarrassed.\n\n\"I did not mean to offend you, my friend,\" said the geographer; \"but\nfor a month our food has been of that sort, and we have dined, not at\na table, but stretched on the ground, except when we were astride of\nthe trees.

The major and the travelers, after a rapid\ntoilette, seated themselves at the table. Ample justice was done to\nMr. Olbinett's repast, which was declared excellent and even superior\nto the splendid banquets of the Pampas. Paganel called twice for every\ndish, \"through absent-mindedness,\" as he said. This unfortunate word\nled Lady Helena to inquire if the amiable Frenchman had occasionally\nshown his habitual failing. The major and Lord Glenarvan looked at each\nother with a smile. As for Paganel, he laughed heartily, and promised\n\"upon his honor\" not to commit a single blunder during the entire\nvoyage. He then in a very comical way told the story of his mistake in\nthe study of Spanish.\n\n\"After all,\" he added, in conclusion, \"misfortunes are sometimes\nbeneficial, and I do not regret my error.\"\n\n\"And why, my worthy friend?\" asked the major.\n\n\"Because I not only know Spanish, but Portuguese also.

He did not,\nhowever, notice one peculiarity observed by Glenarvan, and that was the\nyoung captain's attentions to his neighbor, Mary Grant.

There was no\ncommerce, no activity, no business. The mandolin resounded from every\nbalcony, languishing songs issued from the lattices of the windows, and\nConcepcion, the ancient city of men, had become a village of women and\nchildren.\n\nGlenarvan appeared little desirous of seeking the causes of this\ndecline--though Jacques Paganel attacked him on this subject--and,\nwithout losing an instant, betook himself to the house of J. R.\nBentock, Esq., consul of Her Britannic Majesty. This individual\nreceived him very courteously, and when he learned the story of Captain\nGrant undertook to search along the entire coast.\n\nThe question whether the Britannia had been wrecked on the shores of\nChili or Araucania was decided in the negative. No report of such an\nevent had come either to the consul, or his colleagues in other parts\nof the country.\n\nBut Glenarvan was not discouraged. He returned to Talcahuana, and,\nsparing neither fatigue, trouble, or money, he sent men to the coast,\nbut their search was in vain. The most minute inquiries among the\npeople of the vicinity were of no avail. They were forced to conclude\nthat the Britannia had left no trace of her shipwreck.\n\n[Illustration: In Concepcion.]\n\n[Sidenote: \"TRY AGAIN!\"]\n\nGlenarvan then informed his companions of the failure of his endeavors.\nMary Grant and her brother could not restrain their grief. It was now\nsix days since the arrival of the Duncan at Talcahuana. The passengers\nwere together in the cabin. Lady Helena was consoling, not by her\nwords--for what could she say?--but by her caresses, the two children\nof the captain. Jacques Paganel had taken up the document again, and\nwas regarding it with earnest attention, as if he would have drawn from\nit new secrets. For an hour he had examined it thus, when Glenarvan,\naddressing him, said,--\n\n\"Paganel, I appeal to your sagacity. Is the interpretation we have made\nof this document incorrect? Is the sense of these words illogical?\"\n\nPaganel did not answer. He was reflecting.\n\n\"Are we mistaken as to the supposed scene of the shipwreck?\" continued\nGlenarvan. \"Does not the name Patagonia suggest itself at once to the\nmind?\"\n\nPaganel was still silent.\n\n\"In short,\" said Glenarvan, \"does not the word _Indian_ justify us\nstill more?\"\n\n\"Perfectly,\" replied MacNabb.\n\n\"And therefore, is it not evident that these shipwrecked men, when they\nwrote these lines, expected to be prisoners of the Indians?\"\n\n\"There you are wrong, my dear lord,\" said Paganel, at last; \"and if\nyour other conclusions are just, the last at least does not seem to me\nrational.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Lady Helena, while all eyes were turned\ntowards the geographer.\n\n\"I mean,\" answered Paganel, emphasizing his words, \"that Captain Grant\nis _now prisoner of the Indians_: and I will add that the document\nleaves no doubt on this point.\"\n\n\"Explain yourself, sir,\" said Miss Grant.\n\n\"Nothing is easier, my dear Mary. Instead of reading _they will be\nprisoners_, read _they are prisoners_, and all will be clear.\"\n\n\"But that is impossible,\" replied Glenarvan.\n\n\"Impossible?

But I regret that Maria Theresa is not a large\nand fertile island, with a river instead of a rivulet, and a harbor\ninstead of a coast so exposed to the force of the waves.\"\n\n\"And why, captain?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"Because I would have laid here the foundation of that colony that I\nwish to present to Scotland.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Glenarvan. \"Then you have not abandoned the idea that has\nmade you so popular in your native land?\"\n\n\"No, my lord; and God has saved me, through your instrumentality, only\nto permit me to accomplish it. Our poor brothers of old Caledonia shall\nyet have another Scotland in the New World. Our dear country must\npossess in these seas a colony of her own, where she can find that\nindependence and prosperity that are wanting in many European empires.\"\n\n\"That is well said, captain,\" replied Lady Helena. \"It is a noble\nproject, and worthy of a great heart. But this island----?\"\n\n\"No, madam, it is a rock, only large enough to support a few colonists;\nwhile we need a vast territory, rich in all primitive treasures.\"\n\n\"Well, captain,\" cried Glenarvan, \"the future is before us! Let us seek\nthis land together!\"\n\nThe hands of both men met in a warm clasp, as if to ratify this\npromise. All now wished to hear the story of the shipwrecked sailors\nof the Britannia during those two long years of solitude. Harry Grant\naccordingly hastened to satisfy the desires of his new friends, and\nbegan as follows:\n\n[Illustration: Harry Grant set his table in the shade, and all took\nseats around it.]\n\n[Sidenote: A TALE OF INDUSTRY.]\n\n\"It was on the night of the 26th of June, 1862, that the Britannia,\ndisabled by a six days' tempest, was wrecked on the rock of Maria\nTheresa. The sea was so high that to save anything was impossible,\nand all the crew perished except my two sailors, Bob Learce and Joe\nBell, and myself; and we succeeded in reaching the coast after many\nstruggles. The land that we thus reached was only a desert island, two\nmiles wide and five long, with a few trees in the interior, some meadow\nland, and a spring of fresh water that, fortunately, has never ceased\nto flow. Alone with my two sailors, in this quarter of the globe, I did\nnot despair, but, placing my confidence in God, engaged in a resolute\nstruggle. Bob and Joe, my companions and friends in misfortune,\nenergetically aided my efforts. We began, like Robinson Crusoe, by\ncollecting the fragments of the vessel, some tools, a little powder,\nseveral weapons, and a bag of precious seeds. The first weeks were very\ntoilsome, but soon hunting and fishing furnished us subsistence, for\nwild goats swarmed in the interior of the island, and marine animals\nabounded on its coast. Gradually our daily routine was regularly\norganized. I determined our exact situation by my instruments, which\nI had saved from the shipwreck. We were out of the regular course of\nships, and could not be rescued except by a providential interposition.\nAlthough thinking of those who were dear to me, and whom I never\nexpected to see again, still I accepted this trial with fortitude, and\nmy most earnest prayers were for my two children. Meantime we labored\nresolutely. Much of the land was sown with the seeds taken from the\nBritannia; and potatoes, chicory, sorrel, and other vegetables improved\nand varied our daily food.

He did not,\nhowever, notice one peculiarity observed by Glenarvan, and that was the\nyoung captain's attentions to his neighbor, Mary Grant. A slight sign\nfrom Lady Helena to her husband told him how matters stood. He gazed at\nthe two young people with affectionate sympathy, and finally addressed\nthe captain, but upon a different subject.\n\n\"How did you succeed with your voyage, captain?\" he inquired.\n\n\"Excellently,\" replied the captain; \"only I must inform your lordship\nthat we did not return by way of the Strait of Magellan.\"\n\n\"What!\" cried Paganel, \"you doubled Cape Horn, and I was not there!\"\n\n\"Hang yourself!\" said the major.\n\n\"Selfish fellow! you give me this advice in order that you may share my\nrope!\" retorted the geographer.\n\n\"Well, my dear Paganel,\" added Glenarvan, \"unless we are endowed with\nubiquity, we cannot be everywhere. Since you crossed the Pampas, you\ncould not at the same time double Cape Horn.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless, I am sorry,\" replied the geographer.\n\nCaptain Mangles now told the story of his voyage, and was congratulated\nby Glenarvan, who, addressing Mary Grant, said,--\n\n\"My dear young lady, I see that Captain John pays his homage to your\nnoble qualities, and I am happy to find that you are not displeased\nwith his ship.\"\n\n\"Oh, how could I be?\" replied Mary, gazing at Lady Helena, and perhaps\nalso at the young captain.\n\n\"My sister loves you, Mr. Captain,\" cried Robert, \"and I do too.\"\n\n\"And I return your love, my dear boy,\" replied Captain Mangles, a\nlittle confused by Robert's words, which also brought a slight blush to\nthe face of the young girl.\n\nThen, changing the conversation to a less embarrassing subject, the\ncaptain added,--\n\n\"Since I have related the Duncan's voyage, will not your lordship give\nus a few particulars of your travels, and the exploits of our young\nhero?\"\n\nNo recital could have been more agreeable to Lady Helena and Miss\nGrant, and Glenarvan hastened to satisfy their curiosity. He told, word\nfor word, all about their journey from ocean to ocean. The passage\nof the Andes, the earthquake, Robert's disappearance, his capture by\nthe condor, Thalcave's fortunate shot, the adventure with the wolves,\nthe boy's devotion, the meeting with Sergeant Manuel, the inundation,\ntheir refuge in the tree, the lightning, the fire, the alligators,\nthe water-spout, the night on the shores of the Atlantic, all these\nincidents, cheerful or serious, excited alternately the joy and terror\nof his hearers. Many a circumstance was related that brought Robert\nthe caresses of his sister and Lady Helena. Never was boy more highly\npraised, or by more enthusiastic friends.\n\n\"Now, my friends,\" remarked Lord Glenarvan, when he had finished his\nrecital, \"let us think of the present. Let us return to the subject of\nCaptain Grant.\"\n\nWhen breakfast was over, the party repaired to Lady Helena's\nstate-room, and, taking seats around a table loaded with maps and\ncharts, resumed the conversation. Glenarvan explained that the\nshipwreck had not taken place on the shores either of the Pacific or\nthe Atlantic, and that, consequently, the document had been wrongly\ninterpreted so far as Patagonia was concerned; that Paganel, by a\nsudden inspiration, had discovered the mistake and proved that they had\nbeen following a false trail. The geographer was accordingly asked to\nexplain the French document, which he did to the satisfaction of every\none. When he had finished his demonstration, Glenarvan announced that\nthe Duncan would immediately set sail for Australia.\n\nThe major, however, before the order was given, asked permission to\nmake a single remark.\n\n\"Speak, major,\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\"My object,\" said MacNabb, \"is not to invalidate the arguments of my\nfriend Paganel, still less to refute them.

He returned speedily, advised\nthe prisoner to be more careful, and departed.\n\nDantès heard joyfully the key grate in the lock; he listened until the\nsound of steps died away, and then, hastily displacing his bed, saw by\nthe faint light that penetrated into his cell, that he had labored\nuselessly the previous evening in attacking the stone instead of\nremoving the plaster that surrounded it.\n\nThe damp had rendered it friable, and Dantès was able to break it\noff—in small morsels, it is true, but at the end of half an hour he had\nscraped off a handful; a mathematician might have calculated that in\ntwo years, supposing that the rock was not encountered, a passage\ntwenty feet long and two feet broad, might be formed.\n\nThe prisoner reproached himself with not having thus employed the hours\nhe had passed in vain hopes, prayer, and despondency. During the six\nyears that he had been imprisoned, what might he not have accomplished?\n\nThis idea imparted new energy, and in three days he had succeeded, with\nthe utmost precaution, in removing the cement, and exposing the\nstone-work. The wall was built of rough stones, among which, to give\nstrength to the structure, blocks of hewn stone were at intervals\nimbedded. It was one of these he had uncovered, and which he must\nremove from its socket.\n\nDantès strove to do this with his nails, but they were too weak. The\nfragments of the jug broke, and after an hour of useless toil, Dantès\npaused with anguish on his brow.\n\nWas he to be thus stopped at the beginning, and was he to wait inactive\nuntil his fellow workman had completed his task? Suddenly an idea\noccurred to him—he smiled, and the perspiration dried on his forehead.\n\nThe jailer always brought Dantès’ soup in an iron saucepan; this\nsaucepan contained soup for both prisoners, for Dantès had noticed that\nit was either quite full, or half empty, according as the turnkey gave\nit to him or to his companion first.\n\nThe handle of this saucepan was of iron; Dantès would have given ten\nyears of his life in exchange for it.\n\n0191m\n\n\n\nThe jailer was accustomed to pour the contents of the saucepan into\nDantès’ plate, and Dantès, after eating his soup with a wooden spoon,\nwashed the plate, which thus served for every day. Now when evening\ncame Dantès put his plate on the ground near the door; the jailer, as\nhe entered, stepped on it and broke it.\n\nThis time he could not blame Dantès. He was wrong to leave it there,\nbut the jailer was wrong not to have looked before him. The jailer,\ntherefore, only grumbled. Then he looked about for something to pour\nthe soup into; Dantès’ entire dinner service consisted of one\nplate—there was no alternative.\n\n“Leave the saucepan,” said Dantès; “you can take it away when you bring\nme my breakfast.”\n\nThis advice was to the jailer’s taste, as it spared him the necessity\nof making another trip. He left the saucepan.\n\nDantès was beside himself with joy. He rapidly devoured his food, and\nafter waiting an hour, lest the jailer should change his mind and\nreturn, he removed his bed, took the handle of the saucepan, inserted\nthe point between the hewn stone and rough stones of the wall, and\nemployed it as a lever. A slight oscillation showed Dantès that all\nwent well. At the end of an hour the stone was extricated from the\nwall, leaving a cavity a foot and a half in diameter.\n\nDantès carefully collected the plaster, carried it into the corner of\nhis cell, and covered it with earth. Then, wishing to make the best use\nof his time while he had the means of labor, he continued to work\nwithout ceasing. At the dawn of day he replaced the stone, pushed his\nbed against the wall, and lay down. The breakfast consisted of a piece\nof bread; the jailer entered and placed the bread on the table.\n\n“Well, don’t you intend to bring me another plat"}, {"chunk_id": 201, "text": "\nthat leads from Palestrina to Borgo; every day, at nine o’clock in the\nmorning, the priest and the boy sat down on a bank by the wayside, and\nthe little shepherd took his lesson out of the priest’s breviary. At\nthe end of three months he had learned to read. This was not enough—he\nmust now learn to write. The priest had a writing teacher at Rome make\nthree alphabets—one large, one middling, and one small; and pointed out\nto him that by the help of a sharp instrument he could trace the\nletters on a slate, and thus learn to write. The same evening, when the\nflock was safe at the farm, the little Luigi hastened to the smith at\nPalestrina, took a large nail, heated and sharpened it, and formed a\nsort of stylus. The next morning he gathered an armful of pieces of\nslate and began. At the end of three months he had learned to write.\nThe curate, astonished at his quickness and intelligence, made him a\npresent of pens, paper, and a penknife. This demanded new effort, but\nnothing compared to the first; at the end of a week he wrote as well\nwith this pen as with the stylus. The curate related the incident to\nthe Count of San-Felice, who sent for the little shepherd, made him\nread and write before him, ordered his attendant to let him eat with\nthe domestics, and to give him two piastres a month. With this, Luigi\npurchased books and pencils. He applied his imitative powers to\neverything, and, like Giotto, when young, he drew on his slate sheep,\nhouses, and trees. Then, with his knife, he began to carve all sorts of\nobjects in wood; it was thus that Pinelli, the famous sculptor, had\ncommenced.\n\n20105m\n\n\n\n“A girl of six or seven—that is, a little younger than Vampa—tended\nsheep on a farm near Palestrina; she was an orphan, born at Valmontone\nand was named Teresa. The two children met, sat down near each other,\nlet their flocks mingle together, played, laughed, and conversed\ntogether; in the evening they separated the Count of San-Felice’s flock\nfrom those of Baron Cervetri, and the children returned to their\nrespective farms, promising to meet the next morning. The next day they\nkept their word, and thus they grew up together. Vampa was twelve, and\nTeresa eleven. And yet their natural disposition revealed itself.\nBeside his taste for the fine arts, which Luigi had carried as far as\nhe could in his solitude, he was given to alternating fits of sadness\nand enthusiasm, was often angry and capricious, and always sarcastic.\nNone of the lads of Pampinara, Palestrina, or Valmontone had been able\nto gain any influence over him or even to become his companion. His\ndisposition (always inclined to exact concessions rather than to make\nthem) kept him aloof from all friendships. Teresa alone ruled by a\nlook, a word, a gesture, this impetuous character, which yielded\nbeneath the hand of a woman, and which beneath the hand of a man might\nhave broken, but could never have been bended. Teresa was lively and\ngay, but coquettish to excess. The two piastres that Luigi received\nevery month from the Count of San-Felice’s steward, and the price of\nall the little carvings in wood he sold at Rome, were expended in\near-rings, necklaces, and gold hairpins. So that, thanks to her\nfriend’s generosity, Teresa was the most beautiful and the best-attired\npeasant near Rome.\n\n“The two children grew up together, passing all their time with each\nother, and giving themselves up to the wild ideas of their different\ncharacters. Thus, in all their dreams, their wishes, and their\nconversations, Vampa saw himself the captain of a vessel, general of an\narmy, or governor of a province. Teresa saw herself rich, superbly\nattired, and attended by a train of liveried domestics. Then, when they\nhad thus passed the day in building castles in the air, they separated\ntheir flocks, and descended from the elevation of their dreams to the\nreality of their humble position.\n\n“One day the young shepherd told the count’s steward that he had seen a\nwolf come out of the Sabine mountains, and prowl ar"}, {"chunk_id": 526, "text": "nstantinople, and in whom my\nfather placed so much confidence; for he knew that all the soldiers of\nthe French emperor were naturally noble and generous. She advanced some\nsteps towards the staircase, and listened. ‘They are approaching,’ said\nshe; ‘perhaps they bring us peace and liberty!’\n\n“‘What do you fear, Vasiliki?’ said Selim, in a voice at once so gentle\nand yet so proud. ‘If they do not bring us peace, we will give them\nwar; if they do not bring life, we will give them death.’ And he\nrenewed the flame of his lance with a gesture which made one think of\nDionysus of old Crete.16 But I, being only a little child, was\nterrified by this undaunted courage, which appeared to me both\nferocious and senseless, and I recoiled with horror from the idea of\nthe frightful death amidst fire and flames which probably awaited us.\n\n“My mother experienced the same sensations, for I felt her tremble.\n‘Mamma, mamma,’ said I, ‘are we really to be killed?’ And at the sound\nof my voice the slaves redoubled their cries and prayers and\nlamentations. ‘My child,’ said Vasiliki, ‘may God preserve you from\never wishing for that death which today you so much dread!’ Then,\nwhispering to Selim, she asked what were her master’s orders. ‘If he\nsend me his poniard, it will signify that the emperor’s intentions are\nnot favorable, and I am to set fire to the powder; if, on the contrary,\nhe send me his ring, it will be a sign that the emperor pardons him,\nand I am to extinguish the match and leave the magazine untouched.’—‘My\nfriend,’ said my mother, ‘when your master’s orders arrive, if it is\nthe poniard which he sends, instead of despatching us by that horrible\ndeath which we both so much dread, you will mercifully kill us with\nthis same poniard, will you not?’—‘Yes, Vasiliki,’ replied Selim\ntranquilly.\n\n“Suddenly we heard loud cries; and, listening, discerned that they were\ncries of joy. The name of the French officer who had been sent to\nConstantinople resounded on all sides amongst our Palikares; it was\nevident that he brought the answer of the emperor, and that it was\nfavorable.”\n\n“And do you not remember the Frenchman’s name?” said Morcerf, quite\nready to aid the memory of the narrator. Monte Cristo made a sign to\nhim to be silent.\n\n“I do not recollect it,” said Haydée.\n\n“The noise increased; steps were heard approaching nearer and nearer;\nthey were descending the steps leading to the cavern. Selim made ready\nhis lance. Soon a figure appeared in the gray twilight at the entrance\nof the cave, formed by the reflection of the few rays of daylight which\nhad found their way into this gloomy retreat. ‘Who are you?’ cried\nSelim. ‘But whoever you may be, I charge you not to advance another\nstep.’—‘Long live the emperor!’ said the figure. ‘He grants a full\npardon to the Vizier Ali, and not only gives him his life, but restores\nto him his fortune and his possessions.’ My mother uttered a cry of\njoy, and clasped me to her bosom. ‘Stop,’ said Selim, seeing that she\nwas about to go out; ‘you see I have not yet received the\nring,’—‘True,’ said my mother. And she fell on her knees, at the same\ntime holding me up towards heaven, as if she desired, while praying to\nGod in my behalf, to raise me actually to his presence.”\n\nAnd for the second time Haydée stopped, overcome by such violent\nemotion that the perspiration stood upon her pale brow, and her stifled\nvoice seemed hardly able to find utterance, so parched and dry were her\nthroat and lips.\n\n40076m\n\n\n\nMonte Cristo poured a little iced water into a glass, and presented it\nto her, saying with a mildness in which was also a shade of\ncommand,—“Courage.”\n\nHaydée dried her eyes, and continued:\n\n“By this time our eyes, habituated to the darkness, had recognized the\nmessenger of the pasha,—it was a friend. Selim had also recognized him,\nbut the brave young man only acknowledged one duty, which was to obey.\n‘In whose name do you come?’ said he to him. ‘I come in the name of our\nmaster, Ali Tepelini.’—‘If you come from Ali "}, {"chunk_id": 101, "text": " to belong to him alo...\n\nheir.\n\n                    “25th April, 149’”\n\n\n“Well!” said Faria, when the young man had finished reading it.\n\n“Why,” replied Dantès, “I see nothing but broken lines and unconnected\nwords, which are rendered illegible by fire.”\n\n“Yes, to you, my friend, who read them for the first time; but not for\nme, who have grown pale over them by many nights’ study, and have\nreconstructed every phrase, completed every thought.”\n\n“And do you believe you have discovered the hidden meaning?”\n\n“I am sure I have, and you shall judge for yourself; but first listen\nto the history of this paper.”\n\n“Silence!” exclaimed Dantès. “Steps approach—I go—adieu!”\n\nAnd Dantès, happy to escape the history and explanation which would be\nsure to confirm his belief in his friend’s mental instability, glided\nlike a snake along the narrow passage; while Faria, restored by his\nalarm to a certain amount of activity, pushed the stone into place with\nhis foot, and covered it with a mat in order the more effectually to\navoid discovery.\n\nIt was the governor, who, hearing of Faria’s illness from the jailer,\nhad come in person to see him.\n\nFaria sat up to receive him, avoiding all gestures in order that he\nmight conceal from the governor the paralysis that had already half\nstricken him with death. His fear was lest the governor, touched with\npity, might order him to be removed to better quarters, and thus\nseparate him from his young companion. But fortunately this was not the\ncase, and the governor left him, convinced that the poor madman, for\nwhom in his heart he felt a kind of affection, was only troubled with a\nslight indisposition.\n\nDuring this time, Edmond, seated on his bed with his head in his hands,\ntried to collect his scattered thoughts. Faria, since their first\nacquaintance, had been on all points so rational and logical, so\nwonderfully sagacious, in fact, that he could not understand how so\nmuch wisdom on all points could be allied with madness. Was Faria\ndeceived as to his treasure, or was all the world deceived as to Faria?\n\nDantès remained in his cell all day, not daring to return to his\nfriend, thinking thus to defer the moment when he should be convinced,\nonce for all, that the abbé was mad—such a conviction would be so\nterrible!\n\nBut, towards the evening after the hour for the customary visit had\ngone by, Faria, not seeing the young man appear, tried to move and get\nover the distance which separated them. Edmond shuddered when he heard\nthe painful efforts which the old man made to drag himself along; his\nleg was inert, and he could no longer make use of one arm. Edmond was\nobliged to assist him, for otherwise he would not have been able to\nenter by the small aperture which led to Dantès’ chamber.\n\n“Here I am, pursuing you remorselessly,” he said with a benignant\nsmile. “You thought to escape my munificence, but it is in vain. Listen\nto me.”\n\nEdmond saw there was no escape, and placing the old man on his bed, he\nseated himself on the stool beside him.\n\n“You know,” said the abbé, “that I was the secretary and intimate\nfriend of Cardinal Spada, the last of the princes of that name. I owe\nto this worthy lord all the happiness I ever knew. He was not rich,\nalthough the wealth of his family had passed into a proverb, and I\nheard the phrase very often, ‘As rich as a Spada.’ But he, like public\nrumor, lived on this reputation for wealth; his palace was my paradise.\nI was tutor to his nephews, who are dead; and when he was alone in the\nworld, I tried by absolute devotion to his will, to make up to him all\nhe had done for me during ten years of unremitting kindness. The\ncardinal’s house had no secrets for me. I had often seen my noble\npatron annotating ancient volumes, and eagerly searching amongst dusty\nfamily manuscripts. One day when I was reproaching him for his\nunavailing searches, and deploring the prostration of mind that\nfollowed them, he looked at me, and, smiling bitterly, opened a volume\nrelating to the History of the City "}, {"chunk_id": 215, "text": "ended.\n\nBut however the mind of the young man might be absorbed in these\nreflections, they were at once dispersed at the sight of the dark\nfrowning ruins of the stupendous Colosseum, through the various\nopenings of which the pale moonlight played and flickered like the\nunearthly gleam from the eyes of the wandering dead. The carriage\nstopped near the Meta Sudans; the door was opened, and the young men,\neagerly alighting, found themselves opposite a _cicerone_, who appeared\nto have sprung up from the ground, so unexpected was his appearance.\n\nThe usual guide from the hotel having followed them, they had paid two\nconductors, nor is it possible, at Rome, to avoid this abundant supply\nof guides; besides the ordinary _cicerone_, who seizes upon you\ndirectly you set foot in your hotel, and never quits you while you\nremain in the city, there is also a special _cicerone_ belonging to\neach monument—nay, almost to each part of a monument. It may,\ntherefore, be easily imagined there is no scarcity of guides at the\nColosseum, that wonder of all ages, which Martial thus eulogizes:\n\n“Let Memphis cease to boast the barbarous miracles of her pyramids, and\nthe wonders of Babylon be talked of no more among us; all must bow to\nthe superiority of the gigantic labor of the Cæsars, and the many\nvoices of Fame spread far and wide the surpassing merits of this\nincomparable monument.”\n\nAs for Albert and Franz, they essayed not to escape from their\n_ciceronian_ tyrants; and, indeed, it would have been so much the more\ndifficult to break their bondage, as the guides alone are permitted to\nvisit these monuments with torches in their hands. Thus, then, the\nyoung men made no attempt at resistance, but blindly and confidingly\nsurrendered themselves into the care and custody of their conductors.\n\nFranz had already made seven or eight similar excursions to the\nColosseum, while his less favored companion trod for the first time in\nhis life the classic ground forming the monument of Flavius Vespasian;\nand, to his credit be it spoken, his mind, even amid the glib loquacity\nof the guides, was duly and deeply touched with awe and enthusiastic\nadmiration of all he saw; and certainly no adequate notion of these\nstupendous ruins can be formed save by such as have visited them, and\nmore especially by moonlight, at which time the vast proportions of the\nbuilding appear twice as large when viewed by the mysterious beams of a\nsouthern moonlit sky, whose rays are sufficiently clear and vivid to\nlight the horizon with a glow equal to the soft twilight of a western\nclime.\n\nScarcely, therefore, had the reflective Franz walked a hundred steps\nbeneath the interior porticoes of the ruin, when, abandoning Albert to\nthe guides (who would by no means yield their prescriptive right of\ncarrying their victims through the routine regularly laid down, and as\nregularly followed by them, but dragged the unconscious visitor to the\nvarious objects with a pertinacity that admitted of no appeal,\nbeginning, as a matter of course, with the “Lions’ Den”, the “Hall of\nthe Gladiators” and finishing with “Cæsar’s Podium”), to escape a\njargon and mechanical survey of the wonders by which he was surrounded,\nFranz ascended a half-dilapidated staircase, and, leaving them to\nfollow their monotonous round, seated himself at the foot of a column,\nand immediately opposite a large aperture, which permitted him to enjoy\na full and undisturbed view of the gigantic dimensions of the majestic\nruin.\n\nFranz had remained for nearly a quarter of an hour perfectly hidden by\nthe shadow of the vast column at whose base he had found a\nresting-place, and from whence his eyes followed the motions of Albert\nand his guides, who, holding torches in their hands, had emerged from a\nvomitorium at the opposite extremity of the Colosseum, and then again\ndisappeared down the steps conducting to the seats reserved for the\nVestal virgins, resembling, as they glided along, some restless shades\nfollowing the flickering glare of so m"}]}

I invented a preparation that makes linen as\nsmooth and as easy to write on as parchment.”\n\n“You are, then, a chemist?”\n\n“Somewhat; I know Lavoisier, and was the intimate friend of Cabanis.”\n\n“But for such a work you must have needed books—had you any?”\n\n“I had nearly five thousand volumes in my library at Rome; but after\nreading them over many times, I found out that with one hundred and\nfifty well-chosen books a man possesses, if not a complete summary of\nall human knowledge, at least all that a man need really know. I\ndevoted three years of my life to reading and studying these one\nhundred and fifty volumes, till I knew them nearly by heart; so that\nsince I have been in prison, a very slight effort of memory has enabled\nme to recall their contents as readily as though the pages were open\nbefore me. I could recite you the whole of Thucydides, Xenophon,\nPlutarch, Titus Livius, Tacitus, Strada, Jornandes, Dante, Montaigne,\nShakespeare, Spinoza, Machiavelli, and Bossuet. I name only the most\nimportant.”\n\n“You are, doubtless, acquainted with a variety of languages, so as to\nhave been able to read all these?”\n\n“Yes, I speak five of the modern tongues—that is to say, German,\nFrench, Italian, English, and Spanish; by the aid of ancient Greek I\nlearned modern Greek—I don’t speak it so well as I could wish, but I am\nstill trying to improve myself.”\n\n“Improve yourself!” repeated Dantès; “why, how can you manage to do\nso?”\n\n“Why, I made a vocabulary of the words I knew; turned, returned, and\narranged them, so as to enable me to express my thoughts through their\nmedium. I know nearly one thousand words, which is all that is\nabsolutely necessary, although I believe there are nearly one hundred\nthousand in the dictionaries. I cannot hope to be very fluent, but I\ncertainly should have no difficulty in explaining my wants and wishes;\nand that would be quite as much as I should ever require.”\n\nStronger grew the wonder of Dantès, who almost fancied he had to do\nwith one gifted with supernatural powers; still hoping to find some\nimperfection which might bring him down to a level with human beings,\nhe added, “Then if you were not furnished with pens, how did you manage\nto write the work you speak of?”\n\n“I made myself some excellent ones, which would be universally\npreferred to all others if once known. You are aware what huge whitings\nare served to us on _maigre_ days. Well, I selected the cartilages of\nthe heads of these fishes, and you can scarcely imagine the delight\nwith which I welcomed the arrival of each Wednesday, Friday, and\nSaturday, as affording me the means of increasing my stock of pens; for\nI will freely confess that my historical labors have been my greatest\nsolace and relief. While retracing the past, I forget the present; and\ntraversing at will the path of history I cease to remember that I am\nmyself a prisoner.”\n\n“But the ink,” said Dantès; “of what did y"}, {"chunk_id": 71, "text": "inspector; “and the abbé’s plan\nhas not even the merit of originality.”\n\nThen turning to Faria, “I inquired if you are well fed?” said he.\n\n“Swear to me,” replied Faria, “to free me if what I tell you prove\ntrue, and I will stay here while you go to the spot.”\n\n“Are you well fed?” repeated the inspector.\n\n“Monsieur, you run no risk, for, as I told you, I will stay here; so\nthere is no chance of my escaping.”\n\n“You do not reply to my question,” replied the inspector impatiently.\n\n“Nor you to mine,” cried the abbé. “You will not accept my gold; I will\nkeep it for myself. You refuse me my liberty; God will give it me.” And\nthe abbé, casting away his coverlet, resumed his place, and continued\nhis calculations.\n\n0177m\n\n\n\n“What is he doing there?” said the inspector.\n\n“Counting his treasures,” replied the governor.\n\nFaria replied to this sarcasm with a glance of profound contempt. They\nwent out. The turnkey closed the door behind them.\n\n“He was wealthy once, perhaps?” said the inspector.\n\n“Or dreamed he was, and awoke mad.”\n\n“After all,” said the inspector, “if he had been rich, he would not\nhave been here.”\n\nSo the matter ended for the Abbé Faria. He remained in his cell, and\nthis visit only increased the belief in his insanity.\n\nCaligula or Nero, those treasure-seekers, those desirers of the\nimpossible, would have accorded to the poor wretch, in exchange for his\nwealth, the liberty he so earnestly prayed for. But the kings of modern\ntimes, restrained by the limits of mere probability, have neither\ncourage nor desire. They fear the ear that hears their orders, and the\neye that scrutinizes their actions. Formerly they believed themselves\nsprung from Jupiter, and shielded by their birth; but nowadays they are\nnot inviolable.\n\nIt has always been against the policy of despotic governments to suffer\nthe victims of their persecutions to reappear. As the Inquisition\nrarely allowed its victims to be seen with their limbs distorted and\ntheir flesh lacerated by torture, so madness is always concealed in its\ncell, from whence, should it depart, it is conveyed to some gloomy\nhospital, where the doctor has no thought for man or mind in the\nmutilated being the jailer delivers to him. The very madness of the\nAbbé Faria, gone mad in prison, condemned him to perpetual captivity.\n\nThe inspector kept his word with Dantès; he examined the register, and\nfound the following note concerning him:\n\n_Edmond Dantès:_\n\nViolent Bonapartist; took an active part in the return from Elba.\n\nThe greatest watchfulness and care to be exercised.\n\nThis note was in a different hand from the rest, which showed that it\nhad been added since his confinement. The inspector could not contend\nagainst this accusation; he simply wrote, _Nothing to be done._\n\nThis visit had infused new vigor into Dantès; he had, till then,\nforgotten the date; but now, with a fragment of plaster, he wrote the\ndate, 30th July, 1816, and made a mark every day, in order not to lose\nhis reckoning again. Days and weeks passed away, then months—Dantès\nstill waited; he at first expected to be freed in a fortnight. This\nfortnight expired, he decided that the inspector would do nothing until\nhis return to Paris, and that he would not reach there until his\ncircuit was finished, he therefore fixed three months; three months\npassed away, then six more. Finally ten months and a half had gone by\nand no favorable change had taken place, and Dantès began to fancy the\ninspector’s visit but a dream, an illusion of the brain.\n\nAt the expiration of a year the governor was transferred; he had\nobtained charge of the fortress at Ham. He took with him several of his\nsubordinates, and amongst them Dantès’ jailer. A new governor arrived;\nit would have been too tedious to acquire the names of the prisoners;\nhe learned their numbers instead. This horrible place contained fifty\ncells; their inhabitants were designated by the numbers of their cell,\nand the unhappy young man was no longer called Edmond Dantès—he was now\nnumber 3"}, {"chunk_id": 108, "text": "\ndetected, and they would undoubtedly have been separated. Thus a new, a\nstronger, and more inexorable barrier was interposed to cut off the\nrealization of their hopes.\n\n“You see,” said the young man, with an air of sorrowful resignation, to\nFaria, “that God deems it right to take from me any claim to merit for\nwhat you call my devotion to you. I have promised to remain forever\nwith you, and now I could not break my promise if I would. The treasure\nwill be no more mine than yours, and neither of us will quit this\nprison. But my real treasure is not that, my dear friend, which awaits\nme beneath the sombre rocks of Monte Cristo, it is your presence, our\nliving together five or six hours a day, in spite of our jailers; it is\nthe rays of intelligence you have elicited from my brain, the languages\nyou have implanted in my memory, and which have taken root there with\nall their philological ramifications. These different sciences that you\nhave made so easy to me by the depth of the knowledge you possess of\nthem, and the clearness of the principles to which you have reduced\nthem—this is my treasure, my beloved friend, and with this you have\nmade me rich and happy. Believe me, and take comfort, this is better\nfor me than tons of gold and cases of diamonds, even were they not as\nproblematical as the clouds we see in the morning floating over the\nsea, which we take for _terra firma_, and which evaporate and vanish as\nwe draw near to them. To have you as long as possible near me, to hear\nyour eloquent speech,—which embellishes my mind, strengthens my soul,\nand makes my whole frame capable of great and terrible things, if I\nshould ever be free,—so fills my whole existence, that the despair to\nwhich I was just on the point of yielding when I knew you, has no\nlonger any hold over me; and this—this is my fortune—not chimerical,\nbut actual. I owe you my real good, my present happiness; and all the\nsovereigns of the earth, even Cæsar Borgia himself, could not deprive\nme of this.”\n\nThus, if not actually happy, yet the days these two unfortunates passed\ntogether went quickly. Faria, who for so long a time had kept silence\nas to the treasure, now perpetually talked of it. As he had prophesied\nwould be the case, he remained paralyzed in the right arm and the left\nleg, and had given up all hope of ever enjoying it himself. But he was\ncontinually thinking over some means of escape for his young companion,\nand anticipating the pleasure he would enjoy. For fear the letter might\nbe some day lost or stolen, he compelled Dantès to learn it by heart;\nand Dantès knew it from the first to the last word. Then he destroyed\nthe second portion, assured that if the first were seized, no one would\nbe able to discover its real meaning. Whole hours sometimes passed\nwhile Faria was giving instructions to Dantès,—instructions which were\nto serve him when he was at liberty. Then, once free, from the day and\nhour and moment when he was so, he could have but one only thought,\nwhich was, to gain Monte Cristo by some means, and remain there alone\nunder some pretext which would arouse no suspicions; and once there, to\nendeavor to find the wonderful caverns, and search in the appointed\nspot,—the appointed spot, be it remembered, being the farthest angle in\nthe second opening.\n\nIn the meanwhile the hours passed, if not rapidly, at least tolerably.\nFaria, as we have said, without having recovered the use of his hand\nand foot, had regained all the clearness of his understanding, and had\ngradually, besides the moral instructions we have detailed, taught his\nyouthful companion the patient and sublime duty of a prisoner, who\nlearns to make something from nothing. They were thus perpetually\nemployed,—Faria, that he might not see himself grow old; Dantès, for\nfear of recalling the almost extinct past which now only floated in his\nmemory like a distant light wandering in the night.

The Hundred Days\n\nM. Noirtier was a true prophet, and things progressed rapidly, as he\nhad predicted. Everyone knows the history of the famous return from\nElba, a return which was unprecedented in the past, and will probably\nremain without a counterpart in the future.\n\nLouis XVIII. made but a faint attempt to parry this unexpected blow;\nthe monarchy he had scarcely reconstructed tottered on its precarious\nfoundation, and at a sign from the emperor the incongruous structure of\nancient prejudices and new ideas fell to the ground. Villefort,\ntherefore, gained nothing save the king’s gratitude (which was rather\nlikely to injure him at the present time) and the cross of the Legion\nof Honor, which he had the prudence not to wear, although M. de Blacas\nhad duly forwarded the brevet.\n\nNapoleon would, doubtless, have deprived Villefort of his office had it\nnot been for Noirtier, who was all powerful at court, and thus the\nGirondin of ’93 and the Senator of 1806 protected him who so lately had\nbeen his protector. All Villefort’s influence barely enabled him to\nstifle the secret Dantès had so nearly divulged. The king’s procureur\nalone was deprived of his office, being suspected of royalism.\n\nHowever, scarcely was the imperial power established—that is, scarcely\nhad the emperor re-entered the Tuileries and begun to issue orders from\nthe closet into which we have introduced our readers,—he found on the\ntable there Louis XVIII.’s half-filled snuff-box,—scarcely had this\noccurred when Marseilles began, in spite of the authorities, to\nrekindle the flames of civil war, always smouldering in the south, and\nit required but little to excite the populace to acts of far greater\nviolence than the shouts and insults with which they assailed the\nroyalists whenever they ventured abroad.\n\n0159m\n\n\n\nOwing to this change, the worthy shipowner became at that moment—we\nwill not say all powerful, because Morrel was a prudent and rather a\ntimid man, so much so, that many of the most zealous partisans of\nBonaparte accused him of “moderation”—but sufficiently influential to\nmake a demand in favor of Dantès.\n\nVillefort retained his place, but his marriage was put off until a more\nfavorable opportunity. If the emperor remained on the throne, Gérard\nrequired a different alliance to aid his career; if Louis XVIII.\nreturned, the influence of M. de Saint-Méran, like his own, could be\nvastly increased, and the marriage be still more suitable. The deputy\nprocureur was, therefore, the first magistrate of Marseilles, when one\nmorning his door opened, and M. Morrel was announced.\n\nAnyone else would have hastened to receive him; but Villefort was a man\nof ability, and he knew this would be a sign of weakness. He made\nMorrel wait in the antechamber, although he had no one with him, for\nthe simple reason that the king’s procureur always makes everyone wait,\nand after passing a quarter of an hour in reading the papers, he\nordered M. Morrel to be admitted.\n\nMorrel expected Villefort would be dejected; he found him as he had\nfound him six weeks before, calm, firm, and full of that glacial\npoliteness, that most insurmountable barrier which separates the\nwell-bred from the vulgar man.\n\nHe had entered Villefort’s office expecting that the magistrate would\ntremble at the sight of him; on the contrary, he felt a cold shudder\nall over him when he saw Villefort sitting there with his elbow on his\ndesk, and his head leaning on his hand. He stopped at the door;\nVillefort gazed at him as if he had some difficulty in recognizing him;\nthen, after a brief interval, during which the honest shipowner turned\nhis hat in his hands,\n\n“M. Morrel, I believe?” said Villefort.\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“Come nearer,” said the magistrate, with a patronizing wave of the\nhand, “and tell me to what circumstance I owe the honor of this visit.”\n\n“Do you not guess, monsieur?” asked Morrel.\n\n“Not in the least; but if I can serve you in any way I shall be\ndelighted.”\n"}, {"chunk_id": 40, "text": "ot over; in a word I was, as I told you, at\nmy marriage feast; and I should have been married in an hour, and\ntomorrow I intended to start for Paris, had I not been arrested on this\ncharge which you as well as I now see to be unjust.”\n\n“Ah,” said Villefort, “this seems to me the truth. If you have been\nculpable, it was imprudence, and this imprudence was in obedience to\nthe orders of your captain. Give up this letter you have brought from\nElba, and pass your word you will appear should you be required, and go\nand rejoin your friends.\n\n“I am free, then, sir?” cried Dantès joyfully.\n\n“Yes; but first give me this letter.”\n\n“You have it already, for it was taken from me with some others which I\nsee in that packet.”\n\n“Stop a moment,” said the deputy, as Dantès took his hat and gloves.\n“To whom is it addressed?”\n\n_“To Monsieur Noirtier, Rue Coq-Héron, Paris.”_ Had a thunderbolt\nfallen into the room, Villefort could not have been more stupefied. He\nsank into his seat, and hastily turning over the packet, drew forth the\nfatal letter, at which he glanced with an expression of terror.\n\n“M. Noirtier, Rue Coq-Héron, No. 13,” murmured he, growing still paler.\n\n“Yes,” said Dantès; “do you know him?”\n\n“No,” replied Villefort; “a faithful servant of the king does not know\nconspirators.”\n\n0103m\n\n\n\n“It is a conspiracy, then?” asked Dantès, who after believing himself\nfree, now began to feel a tenfold alarm. “I have, however, already told\nyou, sir, I was entirely ignorant of the contents of the letter.”\n\n“Yes; but you knew the name of the person to whom it was addressed,”\nsaid Villefort.\n\n“I was forced to read the address to know to whom to give it.”\n\n“Have you shown this letter to anyone?” asked Villefort, becoming still\nmore pale.\n\n“To no one, on my honor.”\n\n“Everybody is ignorant that you are the bearer of a letter from the\nIsland of Elba, and addressed to M. Noirtier?”\n\n“Everybody, except the person who gave it to me.”\n\n“And that was too much, far too much,” murmured Villefort. Villefort’s\nbrow darkened more and more, his white lips and clenched teeth filled\nDantès with apprehension. After reading the letter, Villefort covered\nhis face with his hands.\n\n“Oh,” said Dantès timidly, “what is the matter?” Villefort made no\nanswer, but raised his head at the expiration of a few seconds, and\nagain perused the letter.\n\n“And you say that you are ignorant of the contents of this letter?”\n\n“I give you my word of honor, sir,” said Dantès; “but what is the\nmatter? You are ill—shall I ring for assistance?—shall I call?”\n\n“No,” said Villefort, rising hastily; “stay where you are. It is for me\nto give orders here, and not you.”\n\n“Monsieur,” replied Dantès proudly, “it was only to summon assistance\nfor you.”\n\n“I want none; it was a temporary indisposition. Attend to yourself;\nanswer me.” Dantès waited, expecting a question, but in vain. Villefort\nfell back on his chair, passed his hand over his brow, moist with\nperspiration, and, for the third time, read the letter.\n\n“Oh, if he knows the contents of this!” murmured he, “and that Noirtier\nis the father of Villefort, I am lost!” And he fixed his eyes upon\nEdmond as if he would have penetrated his thoughts.\n\n“Oh, it is impossible to doubt it,” cried he, suddenly.\n\n“In heaven’s name!” cried the unhappy young man, “if you doubt me,\nquestion me; I will answer you.” Villefort made a violent effort, and\nin a tone he strove to render firm:\n\n“Sir,” said he, “I am no longer able, as I had hoped, to restore you\nimmediately to liberty; before doing so, I must consult the trial\njustice; what my own feeling is you already know.”\n\n“Oh, monsieur,” cried Dantès, “you have been rather a friend than a\njudge.”\n\n0105m\n\n\n\n“Well, I must detain you some time longer, but I will strive to make it\nas short as possible. The principal charge against you is this letter,\nand you see——” Villefort approached the fire, cast it in, and waited\nuntil it was entirely consumed.\n\n“You see, I destroy it?”\n\n“Oh,” exclaimed Dantès, “you are goodness i"}, {"chunk_id": 57, "text": "the contrary,” said Louis XVIII., “this\naffair seems to me to have a decided connection with that which\noccupies our attention, and the death of General Quesnel will, perhaps,\nput us on the direct track of a great internal conspiracy.” At the name\nof General Quesnel, Villefort trembled.\n\n“Everything points to the conclusion, sire,” said the minister of\npolice, “that death was not the result of suicide, as we first\nbelieved, but of assassination. General Quesnel, it appears, had just\nleft a Bonapartist club when he disappeared. An unknown person had been\nwith him that morning, and made an appointment with him in the Rue\nSaint-Jacques; unfortunately, the general’s valet, who was dressing his\nhair at the moment when the stranger entered, heard the street\nmentioned, but did not catch the number.” As the police minister\nrelated this to the king, Villefort, who looked as if his very life\nhung on the speaker’s lips, turned alternately red and pale. The king\nlooked towards him.\n\n“Do you not think with me, M. de Villefort, that General Quesnel, whom\nthey believed attached to the usurper, but who was really entirely\ndevoted to me, has perished the victim of a Bonapartist ambush?”\n\n“It is probable, sire,” replied Villefort. “But is this all that is\nknown?”\n\n“They are on the track of the man who appointed the meeting with him.”\n\n“On his track?” said Villefort.\n\n“Yes, the servant has given his description. He is a man of from fifty\nto fifty-two years of age, dark, with black eyes covered with shaggy\neyebrows, and a thick moustache. He was dressed in a blue frock-coat,\nbuttoned up to the chin, and wore at his button-hole the rosette of an\nofficer of the Legion of Honor. Yesterday a person exactly\ncorresponding with this description was followed, but he was lost sight\nof at the corner of the Rue de la Jussienne and the Rue Coq-Héron.”\nVillefort leaned on the back of an armchair, for as the minister of\npolice went on speaking he felt his legs bend under him; but when he\nlearned that the unknown had escaped the vigilance of the agent who\nfollowed him, he breathed again.\n\n“Continue to seek for this man, sir,” said the king to the minister of\npolice; “for if, as I am all but convinced, General Quesnel, who would\nhave been so useful to us at this moment, has been murdered, his\nassassins, Bonapartists or not, shall be cruelly punished.” It required\nall Villefort’s coolness not to betray the terror with which this\ndeclaration of the king inspired him.\n\n“How strange,” continued the king, with some asperity; “the police\nthink that they have disposed of the whole matter when they say, ‘A\nmurder has been committed,’ and especially so when they can add, ‘And\nwe are on the track of the guilty persons.’”\n\n“Sire, your majesty will, I trust, be amply satisfied on this point at\nleast.”\n\n“We shall see. I will no longer detain you, M. de Villefort, for you\nmust be fatigued after so long a journey; go and rest. Of course you\nstopped at your father’s?” A feeling of faintness came over Villefort.\n\n0145m\n\n\n\n“No, sire,” he replied, “I alighted at the Hotel de Madrid, in the Rue\nde Tournon.”\n\n“But you have seen him?”\n\n“Sire, I went straight to the Duc de Blacas.”\n\n“But you will see him, then?”\n\n“I think not, sire.”\n\n“Ah, I forgot,” said Louis, smiling in a manner which proved that all\nthese questions were not made without a motive; “I forgot you and M.\nNoirtier are not on the best terms possible, and that is another\nsacrifice made to the royal cause, and for which you should be\nrecompensed.”\n\n“Sire, the kindness your majesty deigns to evince towards me is a\nrecompense which so far surpasses my utmost ambition that I have\nnothing more to ask for.”\n\n“Never mind, sir, we will not forget you; make your mind easy. In the\nmeanwhile” (the king here detached the cross of the Legion of Honor\nwhich he usually wore over his blue coat, near the cross of St. Louis,\nabove the order of Notre-Dame-du-Mont-Carmel and St. Lazare, and gave\nit to Villefort)—“in the meanwhile take this "}, {"chunk_id": 31, "text": "hus called up; “but bear in mind, if you\nplease, that our respective parents underwent persecution and\nproscription from diametrically opposite principles; in proof of which\nI may remark, that while my family remained among the staunchest\nadherents of the exiled princes, your father lost no time in joining\nthe new government; and that while the Citizen Noirtier was a Girondin,\nthe Count Noirtier became a senator.”\n\n“Dear mother,” interposed Renée, “you know very well it was agreed that\nall these disagreeable reminiscences should forever be laid aside.”\n\n“Suffer me, also, madame,” replied Villefort, “to add my earnest\nrequest to Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran’s, that you will kindly allow\nthe veil of oblivion to cover and conceal the past. What avails\nrecrimination over matters wholly past recall? For my own part, I have\nlaid aside even the name of my father, and altogether disown his\npolitical principles. He was—nay, probably may still be—a Bonapartist,\nand is called Noirtier; I, on the contrary, am a staunch royalist, and\nstyle myself de Villefort. Let what may remain of revolutionary sap\nexhaust itself and die away with the old trunk, and condescend only to\nregard the young shoot which has started up at a distance from the\nparent tree, without having the power, any more than the wish, to\nseparate entirely from the stock from which it sprung.”\n\n“Bravo, Villefort!” cried the marquis; “excellently well said! Come,\nnow, I have hopes of obtaining what I have been for years endeavoring\nto persuade the marquise to promise; namely, a perfect amnesty and\nforgetfulness of the past.”\n\n“With all my heart,” replied the marquise; “let the past be forever\nforgotten. I promise you it affords _me_ as little pleasure to revive\nit as it does you. All I ask is, that Villefort will be firm and\ninflexible for the future in his political principles. Remember, also,\nVillefort, that we have pledged ourselves to his majesty for your\nfealty and strict loyalty, and that at our recommendation the king\nconsented to forget the past, as I do” (and here she extended to him\nher hand)—“as I now do at your entreaty. But bear in mind, that should\nthere fall in your way anyone guilty of conspiring against the\ngovernment, you will be so much the more bound to visit the offence\nwith rigorous punishment, as it is known you belong to a suspected\nfamily.”\n\n“Alas, madame,” returned Villefort, “my profession, as well as the\ntimes in which we live, compels me to be severe. I have already\nsuccessfully conducted several public prosecutions, and brought the\noffenders to merited punishment. But we have not done with the thing\nyet.”\n\n0087m\n\n\n\n“Do you, indeed, think so?” inquired the marquise.\n\n“I am, at least, fearful of it. Napoleon, in the Island of Elba, is too\nnear France, and his proximity keeps up the hopes of his partisans.\nMarseilles is filled with half-pay officers, who are daily, under one\nfrivolous pretext or other, getting up quarrels with the royalists;\nfrom hence arise continual and fatal duels among the higher classes of\npersons, and assassinations in the lower.”\n\n“You have heard, perhaps,” said the Comte de Salvieux, one of M. de\nSaint-Méran’s oldest friends, and chamberlain to the Comte d’Artois,\n“that the Holy Alliance purpose removing him from thence?”\n\n“Yes; they were talking about it when we left Paris,” said M. de\nSaint-Méran; “and where is it decided to transfer him?”\n\n“To Saint Helena.”\n\n“For heaven’s sake, where is that?” asked the marquise.\n\n“An island situated on the other side of the equator, at least two\nthousand leagues from here,” replied the count.\n\n“So much the better. As Villefort observes, it is a great act of folly\nto have left such a man between Corsica, where he was born, and Naples,\nof which his brother-in-law is king, and face to face with Italy, the\nsovereignty of which he coveted for his son.”\n\n“Unfortunately,” said Villefort, “there are the treaties of 1814, and\nwe cannot molest Napoleon without breaking those compacts.”\n\n“Oh, well, we"}, {"chunk_id": 56, "text": "know what is going\non at sixty leagues from the coast of France! Well, then, see, here is\na gentleman who had none of these resources at his disposal—a\ngentleman, only a simple magistrate, who learned more than you with all\nyour police, and who would have saved my crown, if, like you, he had\nthe power of directing a telegraph.” The look of the minister of police\nwas turned with concentrated spite on Villefort, who bent his head in\nmodest triumph.\n\n“I do not mean that for you, Blacas,” continued Louis XVIII.; “for if\nyou have discovered nothing, at least you have had the good sense to\npersevere in your suspicions. Any other than yourself would have\nconsidered the disclosure of M. de Villefort insignificant, or else\ndictated by venal ambition.” These words were an allusion to the\nsentiments which the minister of police had uttered with so much\nconfidence an hour before.\n\nVillefort understood the king’s intent. Any other person would,\nperhaps, have been overcome by such an intoxicating draught of praise;\nbut he feared to make for himself a mortal enemy of the police\nminister, although he saw that Dandré was irrevocably lost. In fact,\nthe minister, who, in the plenitude of his power, had been unable to\nunearth Napoleon’s secret, might in despair at his own downfall\ninterrogate Dantès and so lay bare the motives of Villefort’s plot.\nRealizing this, Villefort came to the rescue of the crest-fallen\nminister, instead of aiding to crush him.\n\n“Sire,” said Villefort, “the suddenness of this event must prove to\nyour majesty that the issue is in the hands of Providence; what your\nmajesty is pleased to attribute to me as profound perspicacity is\nsimply owing to chance, and I have profited by that chance, like a good\nand devoted servant—that’s all. Do not attribute to me more than I\ndeserve, sire, that your majesty may never have occasion to recall the\nfirst opinion you have been pleased to form of me.” The minister of\npolice thanked the young man by an eloquent look, and Villefort\nunderstood that he had succeeded in his design; that is to say, that\nwithout forfeiting the gratitude of the king, he had made a friend of\none on whom, in case of necessity, he might rely.\n\n“’Tis well,” resumed the king. “And now, gentlemen,” he continued,\nturning towards M. de Blacas and the minister of police, “I have no\nfurther occasion for you, and you may retire; what now remains to do is\nin the department of the minister of war.”\n\n“Fortunately, sire,” said M. de Blacas, “we can rely on the army; your\nmajesty knows how every report confirms their loyalty and attachment.”\n\n“Do not mention reports, duke, to me, for I know now what confidence to\nplace in them. Yet, speaking of reports, baron, what have you learned\nwith regard to the affair in the Rue Saint-Jacques?”\n\n“The affair in the Rue Saint-Jacques!” exclaimed Villefort, unable to\nrepress an exclamation. Then, suddenly pausing, he added, “Your pardon,\nsire, but my devotion to your majesty has made me forget, not the\nrespect I have, for that is too deeply engraved in my heart, but the\nrules of etiquette.”\n\n“Go on, go on, sir,” replied the king; “you have today earned the right\nto make inquiries here.”\n\n“Sire,” interposed the minister of police, “I came a moment ago to give\nyour majesty fresh information which I had obtained on this head, when\nyour majesty’s attention was attracted by the terrible event that has\noccurred in the gulf, and now these facts will cease to interest your\nmajesty.”\n\n“On the contrary, sir,—on the contrary,” said Louis XVIII., “this\naffair seems to me to have a decided connection with that which\noccupies our attention, and the death of General Quesnel will, perhaps,\nput us on the direct track of a great internal conspiracy.” At the name\nof General Quesnel, Villefort trembled.\n\n“Everything points to the conclusion, sire,” said the minister of\npolice, “that death was not the result of suicide, as we first\nbelieved, but of assassination.

Doubtless,\nsome chiefs of the Maori tribe had fallen into the hands of the\nEnglish, and the natives would attempt to recover them by way of\nexchange; their situation, therefore, was not one for despair.\n\nMeantime the canoe rapidly ascended the river. Paganel, whose\nchangeable disposition carried him from one extreme to another, had\nregained his hopefulness. He believed that the Maoris were sparing them\nthe fatigue of their journey to the English settlements, and that they\nwere certain to arrive at their destination. He was, therefore, quite\nresigned to his lot, and traced on his map the course of the Waikato\nacross the plains and valleys of the province. Lady Helena and Mary\nGrant, suppressing their terror, conversed in low tones with Glenarvan,\nand the most skillful physiognomist could not have detected on their\nfaces the anxiety of their hearts.\n\nThe Waikato River is worshiped by the natives, as Paganel knew, and\nEnglish and German naturalists have never ascended beyond its junction\nwith the Waipa. Whither did Kai-Koumou intend to take his captives?\nThe geographer could not have guessed if the word \"Taupo,\" frequently\nrepeated, had not attracted his attention. By consulting his map,\nhe saw that this name was applied to a celebrated lake in the most\nmountainous part of the island, and that from it the Waikato flows.\n\nPaganel, addressing Captain Mangles in French, so as not to be\nunderstood by the savages, asked him how fast the canoe was going. The\ncaptain thought about three miles an hour.\n\n\"Then,\" replied the geographer, \"if we do not travel during the night,\nour voyage to the lake will last about four days.\"\n\n\"But whereabouts are the English garrisons?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"It is difficult to say,\" replied Paganel. \"At all events, the war\nmust have reached the province of Taranaki, and probably the troops\nare collected beyond the mountains, on the side of the lake where the\nhabitations of the savages are concentrated.\"\n\n\"God grant it!\" said Lady Helena.\n\nGlenarvan cast a sorrowful glance at his young wife and Mary Grant,\nexposed to the mercy of these fierce natives, and captives in a wild\ncountry, far from all human assistance. But he saw that he was watched\nby Kai-Koumou, and, not wishing to show that one of the captives was\nhis wife, he prudently kept his thoughts to himself, and gazed at the\nbanks of the river with apparent indifference.\n\n[Sidenote: ACCESSIONS, AND PROGRESS.]\n\nThe sun was just sinking below the horizon as the canoe ran upon a bank\nof pumice-stones, which the Waikato carries with it from its source\nin the volcanic mountains. Several trees grew here, as if designed to\nshelter an encampment. Kai-Koumou landed his prisoners.\n\nThe men had their hands tied, the ladies were free. All were placed\nin the centre of the encampment, around which large fires formed an\nimpassable barrier.\n\nBefore Kai-Koumou had informed his captives of his intention to\nexchange them, Glenarvan and Captain Mangles had discussed various\nmethods of recovering their liberty. What they could not venture in the\nboat they hoped to attempt on land, at the hour for encamping, under\ncover of the night.\n\nBut since Glenarvan's conversation with the chief, it seemed wise to\nabandon this design. They must be patient. It was the most prudent\nplan. The exchange offered chances that neither an open attack nor a\nflight across these unknown regions could afford. Many circumstances\nmight indeed arise that would delay, and even prevent, such a\ntransaction; but still it was better to await the result. What,\nmoreover, could ten defenceless men do against thirty well-armed\nsavages? Besides, Glenarvan thought it likely that Kai-Koumou's tribe\nhad lost some chief of high rank whom they were particularly anxious to\nrecover; and he was not mistaken.\n\nThe next day the canoe ascended the river with increased swiftness.\nIt stopped for a moment at the junction of a small river which wound\nacross the plains on the right bank.

Here, with\noutstretched arms, like a sorcerer exorcising, he made a few grimaces,\nthe meaning of which did not escape the prisoners. As Paganel had\nforeseen, Kai-Koumou was invoking upon the mountain a more rigorous\ntaboo.\n\nSoon after, the natives descended, in single file, the winding paths\nthat led towards the pah.\n\n[Sidenote: A WEARY WAITING.]\n\n\"They are going!\" cried Glenarvan. \"They are abandoning their post!\nGod be thanked! Our scheme has succeeded! My dear Helena, my brave\ncompanions, we are now dead and buried; but this evening we will\nrevive, we will leave our tomb, and flee from these barbarous tribes!\"\n\nIt would be difficult to describe the joy that reigned within the\npalisade. Hope had reanimated all hearts. These courageous travelers\nforgot their past trials, dreaded not the future, and only rejoiced in\ntheir present deliverance; although very little reflection would show\nhow difficult was the task of reaching an European settlement from\ntheir present position. But if Kai-Koumou was outwitted, they believed\nthemselves safe from all the savages of New Zealand.\n\nA whole day must pass before the decisive attempt could be made, and\nthey employed their time in arranging a plan of escape. Paganel had\npreserved his map of New Zealand, and could therefore search out the\nsafest routes.\n\nAfter some discussion, the fugitives resolved to proceed eastward\ntowards the Bay of Plenty. This course would lead them through\ndistricts that were very rarely visited. The travelers, who were\nalready accustomed to overcoming natural difficulties, only feared\nmeeting the Maoris. They therefore determined to avoid them at all\nhazards, and gain the eastern coast, where the missionaries have\nfounded several establishments. Moreover, this portion of the island\nhad hitherto escaped the ravages of the war and the depredations of the\nnatives. As for the distance that separated Lake Taupo from the Bay of\nPlenty, it could not be more than one hundred miles. Ten days would\nsuffice for the journey. The missions once reached, they could rest\nthere, and wait for some favorable opportunity of gaining Auckland,\ntheir destination.\n\nThese points being settled, they continued to watch the savages till\nevening. Not one of them remained at the foot of the mountain, and\nwhen darkness invaded the valleys of the lake, no fire betokened the\npresence of the Maoris at the base of the peak. The coast was clear.\n\nAt nine o'clock it was dark night, and Glenarvan gave the signal for\ndeparture. His companions and he, armed and equipped at Kara-Tété's\nexpense, began to cautiously descend the slopes of the Maunganamu.\nCaptain Mangles and Wilson led the way, with eyes and ears on the\nalert. They stopped at the least sound,--they examined the faintest\nlight; each slid down the declivity, the better to elude detection.\n\nTwo hundred feet below the summit, Captain Mangles and his sailor\nreached the dangerous ridge that had been so obstinately guarded by the\nnatives. If, unfortunately, the Maoris, more crafty than the fugitives,\nhad feigned a retreat to entice them within reach, if they had not\nbeen deceived by the eruption, their presence would be discovered\nat this point. Glenarvan, in spite of his confidence and Paganel's\npleasantries, could not help trembling. The safety of his friends was\nat stake during the few moments necessary to cross the ridge. He felt\nLady Helena's heart beat as she clung to his arm.\n\nBut neither he nor Captain Mangles thought of retreating. The young\ncaptain, followed by the others, and favored by the dense obscurity,\ncrawled along the narrow path, only stopping when some detached stone\nrolled to the base of the mountain. If the savages were still in\nambush, these unusual sounds would provoke from each side a formidable\nvolley.\n\nHowever, in gliding like serpents along this inclined crest, the\nfugitives could not advance rapidly. When Captain Mangles had gained\nthe lowest part, scarcely twenty-five feet sep"}, {"chunk_id": 186, "text": "ome still suffering from recent wounds, stood in perfect immobility,\nenveloped in their flaxen mantles. Three dogs of wild appearance were\nstretched at their feet. The eight rowers seemed to be servants or\nslaves of the chief. They worked vigorously, and the boat ascended the\ncurrent of the Waikato with remarkable swiftness.\n\nIn the centre of this long canoe, with feet tied, but hands free, were\nten European prisoners clinging closely to each other. They were Lord\nGlenarvan and his companions.\n\n[Sidenote: A TESTING TIME.]\n\nThe evening before, the little party, led astray by the dense fog, had\nencamped in the midst of a numerous tribe of natives. About midnight,\nthe travelers, surprised in their sleep, were made prisoners and\ncarried on board the canoe. They had not yet been maltreated, but had\ntried in vain to resist. Their arms and ammunition were in the hands of\nthe savages, and their own bullets would have quickly stretched them on\nthe earth had they attempted to escape.\n\nThey were not long in learning, by the aid of a few English words which\nthe natives used, that, being driven back by the British troops, they\nwere returning, vanquished and weakened, to the regions of the upper\nWaikato. Their chief, after an obstinate resistance, in which he lost\nhis principal warriors, was now on his way to rouse again the river\ntribes. He was called Kai-Koumou, a terrible name, which signified\nin the native language \"he who eats the limbs of his enemy.\" He was\nbrave and bold, but his cruelty equaled his bravery. No pity could be\nexpected from him. His name was well known to the English soldiers, and\na price had been set upon his head by the governor of New Zealand.\n\nThis terrible catastrophe had come upon Glenarvan just as he was\nabout reaching the long-desired harbor of Auckland, whence he would\nhave returned to his native country. Yet, looking at his calm and\npassionless countenance, you could not have divined the depth of his\nanguish, for in his present critical situation he did not betray the\nextent of his misfortunes. He felt that he ought to set an example of\nfortitude to his wife and his companions, as being the husband and\nchief. Moreover, he was ready to die first for the common safety, if\ncircumstances should require it.\n\n[Sidenote: CHIEFS, CIVILIZED AND UNCIVILIZED.]\n\nHis companions were worthy of him; they shared his noble thoughts, and\ntheir calm and haughty appearance would scarcely have intimated that\nthey were being carried away to captivity and suffering. By common\nconsent, at Glenarvan's suggestion, they had resolved to feign a proud\nindifference in the presence of the savages. It was the only way of\ninfluencing those fierce natures.\n\n[Illustration: A boat might have been seen ascending the Waikato. It\nwas a canoe seventy feet long and five broad.]\n\nSince leaving the encampment, the natives, taciturn like all savages,\nhad scarcely spoken to each other. However, from a few words exchanged,\nGlenarvan perceived that they were acquainted with the English\nlanguage. He therefore resolved to question the chief in regard to the\nfate that was in store for them. Addressing Kai-Koumou, he said, in a\nfearless tone:\n\n\"Where are you taking us, chief?\"\n\nKai-Koumou gazed at him coldly without answering.\n\n\"Say, what do you expect to do with us?\" continued Glenarvan.\n\nThe chief's eyes blazed with a sudden light, and in a stern voice he\nreplied:\n\n\"To exchange you, if your friends will ransom you; to kill you, if they\nrefuse.\"\n\nGlenarvan asked no more, but hope returned to his heart. Doubtless,\nsome chiefs of the Maori tribe had fallen into the hands of the\nEnglish, and the natives would attempt to recover them by way of\nexchange; their situation, therefore, was not one for despair.\n\nMeantime the canoe rapidly ascended the river. Paganel, whose\nchangeable disposition carried him from one extreme to another, had\nregained his hopefulness.

He allowed this bloody orgy an hour to reach its utmost\nintensity. The last act of the funeral was played with the usual rites.\n\nThe bodies of Kara-Tété and his wife were taken up, and their limbs\nbent and gathered against the stomach, according to the New Zealand\ncustom. The place for the tomb had been chosen outside of the\nfortification, about two miles distant, on the summit of a small\nmountain, called Maunganamu, situated on the right shore of the lake.\n\nThither the bodies were to be carried. Two very rude palanquins, or\nrather litters, were brought to the foot of the mound. The corpses,\nfolded together, in a sitting posture, and tied in their clothes by a\ngirdle of withes, were placed on this primitive bier. Four warriors\nbore it between them, and the entire tribe, chanting the funeral hymn,\nfollowed them in procession to the place of burial.\n\nThe captives, who were always watched, saw them leave the inner\ninclosure of the pah, and then the songs and cries gradually died away.\nFor about half an hour this funeral escort continued in sight, in the\ndepths of the valley. Finally they perceived it again winding along\nthe mountain paths. The distance gave a fantastic appearance to the\nundulating movements of the long, sinuous column.\n\nThe tribe stopped at the summit of the mountain, which was eight\nhundred feet high, at the place prepared for Kara-Tété's interment.\nA common Maori would have had only a hole and a heap of stones for a\ngrave; but for a powerful and dreaded chief, destined doubtless for a\nspeedy deification, a tomb worthy of his exploits was reserved.\n\n[Sidenote: THE LAST NIGHT.]\n\nThe sepulchre had been surrounded by palisades, while stakes,\nornamented with faces reddened with ochre, stood beside the grave\nwhere the bodies were to lie. The relatives had not forgotten that the\n\"waidoua\" (the spirit of the dead) feeds on substantial nourishment\nlike the body during this perishable life. Food had therefore been\ndeposited in the inclosure, together with the weapons and clothes of\nthe deceased.\n\nNothing was wanting for the comfort of the tomb. Husband and wife were\nlaid side by side, and then covered with earth and grass after a series\nof renewed lamentations. Then the procession silently descended the\nmountain, and now no one could ascend it under penalty of death, for it\nwas tabooed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LI.\n\nSTRANGELY LIBERATED.\n\n\nJust as the sun was disappearing behind Lake Taupo, the captives were\nled back to their prison. They were not to leave it again until the\nsummit of the Wahiti mountains should kindle with the first beams of\nthe day. One night remained to prepare for death. In spite of the\nfaintness, in spite of the horror with which they were seized, they\nshared their repast in common.\n\n\"We shall need all the strength possible to face death,\" said\nGlenarvan. \"We must show these barbarians how Europeans and Christians\ncan die.\"\n\nThe meal being finished, Lady Helena repeated the evening prayer aloud,\nwhile all her companions, with uncovered heads, joined her. Having\nfulfilled this duty, and enjoyed this privilege, the prisoners embraced\neach other. Lady Helena and Mary Grant then retired to one corner of\nthe hut, and stretched themselves upon a mat.

The savages, men, women,\nand children, to the number of several hundreds, assembled in the pah,\nsilent and calm. Kai-Koumou came out of his house, and, surrounded by\nthe principal warriors of his tribe, took his place on a mound several\nfeet high in the centre of the fortification. The crowd of natives\nformed a semicircle around him, and the whole assembly preserved\nabsolute silence.\n\nAt a sign from the chief, a warrior advanced towards the temple.\n\n\"Remember!\" said Lady Helena to her husband.\n\nGlenarvan clasped his wife to his heart. At this moment Mary Grant\napproached John Mangles.\n\n\"Lord and Lady Glenarvan,\" said she, \"I think that, if a wife can die\nby the hand of her husband to escape a degrading existence, a maiden\ncan likewise die by the hand of her lover.

The two women were resigned to their fate, while\nthe men concealed their anguish beneath a calmness that showed\nsuperhuman self-control. They came before the chief, who did not delay\nsentence.\n\n\"You killed Kara-Tété!\" said he to Glenarvan.\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n[Sidenote: THE BEGINNING OF THE END.]\n\n\"You shall die to-morrow at sunrise.\"\n\n\"Alone?\" inquired Glenarvan, whose heart beat quickly.\n\n\"What! as if our Tohonga's life were not more precious than yours!\"\ncried Kai-Koumou, whose eyes expressed a fierce regret.\n\nAt this moment a commotion took place among the natives. Glenarvan cast\na rapid glance around him. The crowd opened, and a warrior, dripping\nwith sweat and overcome with fatigue, appeared.\n\nAs soon as Kai-Koumou perceived him, he said in English, evidently that\nhe might be understood by the captives:\n\n\"You come from the camp of the pale-faces?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the Maori.\n\n\"You saw the prisoner, our Tohonga?\"\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n\"Is he living?\"\n\n\"He is dead! The English have shot him.\"\n\nThe fate of Glenarvan and his companions was settled.\n\n\"You shall all die to-morrow at daybreak!\" cried Kai-Koumou.\n\nThe unfortunates were therefore to suffer a common death. Lady Helena\nand Mary Grant raised towards heaven a look of thankfulness.\n\nThe captives were not taken back to the temple. They were to attend\nthat day the funeral of the dead chief, and the bloody ceremonies\nconnected therewith. A party of natives conducted them to the foot of\nan enormous koudi, where these guardians remained without losing sight\nof their prisoners. The rest of the tribe, absorbed in their official\nmourning, seemed to have forgotten them.\n\nThe customary three days had elapsed since the death of Kara-Tété.

They mourned the dead in plaintive and modulated cadences. His\nrelations struck their heads together; his kinswomen lacerated their\nfaces with their nails, and showed themselves more lavish of blood than\nof tears.

A few moments after\nthey were led back to the temple that served as their prison; but\nRobert Grant and Paganel were no longer with them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER L.\n\nTHE CHIEF'S FUNERAL.\n\n\nKai-Koumou, according to a custom quite ordinary in New Zealand, joined\nthe rank of priest to that of chief, and could, therefore, extend to\npersons or objects the superstitious protection of the taboo.\n\nThe taboo, which is common to the tribes of Polynesia, has the power\nto prohibit at once all connection with the object or person tabooed.\nAccording to the Maori religion, whoever should lay his sacrilegious\nhand on what is declared taboo would be punished with death by the\noffended god; and in case the divinity should delay to avenge his own\ninsult, the priests would not fail to excite his anger.\n\nAs for the prisoners confined in the temple, the taboo had rescued\nthem from the fury of the tribe. Some of the natives, the friends and\npartisans of Kai-Koumou, had stopped suddenly at the command of their\nchief, and had protected the captives.\n\n[Sidenote: THE TORTURES OF SUSPENSE.]\n\nGlenarvan, however, was not blind to the fate that was reserved for\nhim. Only his death could atone for the murder of a chief. Among savage\nraces death is always preceded by a protracted torture. He therefore\nexpected to cruelly expiate the righteous indignation that had nerved\nhis arm, but hoped that Kai-Koumou's rage would fall only on himself.\n\nWhat a night he and his companions passed! Who could depict their\nanguish, or measure their sufferings? Neither poor Robert nor brave\nPaganel had reappeared. But how could they doubt their fate? Were they\nnot the first victims of the natives' vengeance? All hope had vanished\neven from the heart of the major, who did not easily despair. John\nMangles felt himself growing mad at sight of the sad dejection of Mary\nGrant, thus separated from her brother. Glenarvan thought of that\nterrible request of Lady Helena, who, rather than yield to torture or\nslavery, preferred to die by his hand. Could he summon this fearful\ncourage? As for an escape, that was plainly impossible. Ten warriors,\narmed to the teeth, guarded the entrance of the temple.\n\nMorning came at last. There had been no communication between the\nnatives and the prisoners. The hut contained a considerable quantity\nof food, which the unfortunates scarcely touched. Hunger gave place to\ngrief. The day passed without bringing a change or a hope. Doubtless\nthe hour for the dead chief's funeral and their torture would be the\nsame.\n\nHowever, although Glenarvan concluded that Kai-Koumou must have\nabandoned all idea of exchange, the major on this point retained a\ngleam of hope.\n\n\"Who knows,\" said he, reminding Glenarvan of the effect produced upon\nthe chief by the death of Kara-Tété,--\"who knows but that Kai-Koumou in\nreality feels obliged to you?\"\n\nBut, in spite of these observations, Glenarvan would no longer hope.\nThe next day also passed away without the preparations for torture\nbeing made. The reason of the delay was this.\n\nThe Maoris believe that the soul, for three days after death, inhabits\nthe body of the deceased, and therefore during this time the corpse\nremains unburied. This custom was rigorously observed, and for two days\nthe pah was deserted. Captain Mangles frequently stood on Wilson's\nshoulders and surveyed the fortification. No native was seen; only the\nsentinels guarded in turn at the door of their prison.\n\nBut on the third day the huts were opened. The savages, men, women,\nand children, to the number of several hundreds, assembled in the pah,\nsilent and calm. Kai-Koumou came out of his house, and, surrounded by\nthe principal warriors of his tribe, took his place on a mound several\nfeet high in the centre of the fortification. The crowd of natives\nformed a semicircle aroun"}, {"chunk_id": 186, "text": "ome still suffering from recent wounds, stood in perfect immobility,\nenveloped in their flaxen mantles. Three dogs of wild appearance were\nstretched at their feet. The eight rowers seemed to be servants or\nslaves of the chief. They worked vigorously, and the boat ascended the\ncurrent of the Waikato with remarkable swiftness.\n\nIn the centre of this long canoe, with feet tied, but hands free, were\nten European prisoners clinging closely to each other. They were Lord\nGlenarvan and his companions.\n\n[Sidenote: A TESTING TIME.]\n\nThe evening before, the little party, led astray by the dense fog, had\nencamped in the midst of a numerous tribe of natives. About midnight,\nthe travelers, surprised in their sleep, were made prisoners and\ncarried on board the canoe. They had not yet been maltreated, but had\ntried in vain to resist. Their arms and ammunition were in the hands of\nthe savages, and their own bullets would have quickly stretched them on\nthe earth had they attempted to escape.\n\nThey were not long in learning, by the aid of a few English words which\nthe natives used, that, being driven back by the British troops, they\nwere returning, vanquished and weakened, to the regions of the upper\nWaikato. Their chief, after an obstinate resistance, in which he lost\nhis principal warriors, was now on his way to rouse again the river\ntribes. He was called Kai-Koumou, a terrible name, which signified\nin the native language \"he who eats the limbs of his enemy.\" He was\nbrave and bold, but his cruelty equaled his bravery. No pity could be\nexpected from him. His name was well known to the English soldiers, and\na price had been set upon his head by the governor of New Zealand.\n\nThis terrible catastrophe had come upon Glenarvan just as he was\nabout reaching the long-desired harbor of Auckland, whence he would\nhave returned to his native country. Yet, looking at his calm and\npassionless countenance, you could not have divined the depth of his\nanguish, for in his present critical situation he did not betray the\nextent of his misfortunes. He felt that he ought to set an example of\nfortitude to his wife and his companions, as being the husband and\nchief. Moreover, he was ready to die first for the common safety, if\ncircumstances should require it.\n\n[Sidenote: CHIEFS, CIVILIZED AND UNCIVILIZED.]\n\nHis companions were worthy of him; they shared his noble thoughts, and\ntheir calm and haughty appearance would scarcely have intimated that\nthey were being carried away to captivity and suffering. By common\nconsent, at Glenarvan's suggestion, they had resolved to feign a proud\nindifference in the presence of the savages. It was the only way of\ninfluencing those fierce natures.\n\n[Illustration: A boat might have been seen ascending the Waikato. It\nwas a canoe seventy feet long and five broad.]\n\nSince leaving the encampment, the natives, taciturn like all savages,\nhad scarcely spoken to each other. However, from a few words exchanged,\nGlenarvan perceived that they were acquainted with the English\nlanguage. He therefore resolved to question the chief in regard to the\nfate that was in store for them. Addressing Kai-Koumou, he said, in a\nfearless tone:\n\n\"Where are you taking us, chief?\"\n\nKai-Koumou gazed at him coldly without answering.\n\n\"Say, what do you expect to do with us?\" continued Glenarvan.\n\nThe chief's eyes blazed with a sudden light, and in a stern voice he\nreplied:\n\n\"To exchange you, if your friends will ransom you; to kill you, if they\nrefuse.\"\n\nGlenarvan asked no more, but hope returned to his heart. Doubtless,\nsome chiefs of the Maori tribe had fallen into the hands of the\nEnglish, and the natives would attempt to recover them by way of\nexchange; their situation, therefore, was not one for despair.\n\nMeantime the canoe rapidly ascended the river. Paganel, whose\nchangeable disposition carried him from one extreme to another, had\nregained his hopefulness. He believed that the Maoris were sparing them\nthe fatigue of their journey to the English settlements, a"}, {"chunk_id": 191, "text": "ilenced the noisy horde. Glenarvan bowed in token of\nthanks, and slowly resumed his place among his friends.\n\nKai-Koumou, fearing an insurrection of the fanatics of his tribe, now\nled his captives to a sacred place, situated at the other end of the\npah, on the edge of a precipice. This hut rested against a rock that\nrose a hundred feet above it and was a steep boundary to this side of\nthe fortification. In this consecrated temple the priests, or \"arikis,\"\ninstruct the New Zealanders. The building was spacious and tightly\nclosed, and contained the holy and chosen food of the god.\n\nHere the prisoners, temporarily sheltered from the fury of the natives,\nstretched themselves on the flax mats. Lady Helena, her strength\nexhausted and her energy overcome, sank into her husband's arms.\nGlenarvan pressed her to his breast, and said:\n\n\"Courage, my dear Helena; Heaven will not forsake us!\"\n\nRobert was scarcely within the hut before he climbed on Wilson's\nshoulders, and succeeded in thrusting his head through an opening\nbetween the roof and the wall, where strings of pipes were hanging.\nFrom this point his view commanded the whole extent of the pah, as far\nas Kai-Koumou's hut.\n\n\"They have gathered around the chief,\" said he, in a low voice. \"They\nare waving their arms, and howling. Kai-Koumou is going to speak.\"\n\nThe boy was silent for a few moments, then continued:\n\n\"Kai-Koumou is speaking. The savages grow calm; they listen.\"\n\n\"This chief,\" said the major, \"has evidently a personal interest in\nprotecting us. He wishes to exchange his prisoners for some chiefs of\nhis tribe. But will his warriors consent?\"\n\n\"Yes, they are listening to him,\" continued Robert. \"They are\ndispersing; some return to their huts,--others leave the fortification.\"\n\n\"Is it really so?\" cried the major.\n\n\"Yes, Mr. MacNabb,\" replied Robert. \"Kai-Koumou remains alone with the\nwarriors that were in the canoe. Ha! one of them is coming towards us!\"\n\n[Illustration: Robert was scarcely within the hut before he climbed\non Wilson's shoulders, and succeeded in thrusting his head through an\nopening.]\n\n\"Get down, Robert,\" said Glenarvan.\n\nAt this moment Lady Helena, who had risen, seized her husband's arm.\n\n\"Edward,\" said she, in a firm voice, \"neither Mary Grant nor I shall\nfall alive into the hands of those savages!\"\n\nAnd, so saying, she presented to her husband a loaded revolver.\n\n\"A weapon!\" exclaimed Glenarvan, whose eyes suddenly brightened.\n\n\"Yes. The Maoris do not search their female prisoners; but this weapon\nis for us, Edward, not for them.\"\n\n\"Glenarvan,\" said MacNabb quickly, \"hide the revolver. It is not time\nyet.\"\n\nThe weapon was immediately concealed in his clothes. The mat that\nclosed the entrance of the hut was raised. A native appeared. He made a\nsign to the captives to follow him. Glenarvan and his companions passed\nthrough the pah, and stopped before Kai-Koumou.\n\nAround him were assembled the principal warriors of his tribe, among\nwhom was seen the chief whose canoe had first joined Kai-Koumou on the\nriver. He was a man of about forty, robust, and of fierce and cruel\naspect. His name was Kara-Tété, which means in the native language\n\"The Irascible.\" Kai-Koumou treated him with some respect, and from\nthe delicacy of his tattooing it was evident that he occupied a high\nrank in his tribe. An observer, however, would have detected a rivalry\nbetween the two chiefs. The major, indeed, perceived that Kara-Tété's\ninfluence surpassed that of Kai-Koumou. They both ruled the powerful\ntribes of the Waikato with equal rank; and, during this interview,\nalthough Kai-Koumou smiled, his eyes betrayed a deep hostility.\n\nHe now questioned Glenarvan.\n\n\"You are English?\" said he.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Glenarvan, without hesitation, for this nationality\nwould probably facilitate an exchange.\n\n[Sidenote: THE RATE OF BARTER.]\n\n\"And your companions?\" asked Kai-Koumou.\n\n\"My companions are also English. We are shipwrecked travelers, and, if\nyou care to know, we have taken no part in the war"}, {"chunk_id": 202, "text": "d in on all sides.\n\n\"Let us go down,\" cried he, \"before our only way of escape is blocked\nup.\"\n\nBut just as the ladies rose by a final effort, MacNabb stopped them,\nand said:\n\n\"It is useless, Glenarvan. Look!\"\n\nAnd all saw, indeed, that an inexplicable change had taken place in the\nmovements of the Maoris. Their pursuit had been suddenly interrupted.\nTheir ascent of the mountain had ceased, as if by an imperious\ninterdict. The crowd of natives had checked their swiftness, and\nhalted, like the waves of the sea before an impassable rock.\n\nAll the savages, thirsting for blood, were now ranged along the foot\nof the mountain, yelling, gesticulating, and brandishing guns and\nhatchets; but they did not advance a single foot. Their dogs, like\nthemselves, as though chained to earth, howled with rage.\n\nWhat was the difficulty? What invisible power restrained the natives?\nThe fugitives gazed without comprehending, fearing that the charm that\nenchained Kai-Koumou's tribe would dissolve.\n\nSuddenly Captain Mangles uttered a cry that caused his companions to\nturn. He pointed to a little fortress at the summit of the peak.\n\n\"The tomb of the chief Kara-Tété!\" cried Robert.\n\n\"Are you in earnest?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"Yes, my lord, it is the tomb; I recognize it.\"\n\nRobert was right. Fifty feet above, at the extreme point of the\nmountain, stood a small palisaded inclosure of freshly-painted stakes.\nGlenarvan, likewise, recognized the sepulchre of the Maori chief. In\ntheir wanderings they had come to the top of the Maunganamu, where\nKara-Tété had been buried.\n\nFollowed by his companions, he climbed the sides of the peak, to the\nvery foot of the tomb. A large opening, covered with mats, formed the\nentrance. Glenarvan was about to enter, when, all at once, he started\nback suddenly.\n\n\"A savage!\" said he.\n\n\"A savage in this tomb?\" inquired the major.\n\n\"Yes, MacNabb.\"\n\n\"What matter? Let us enter.\"\n\nGlenarvan, the major, Robert, and Captain Mangles passed into the\ninclosure. A Maori was there, clad in a great flax mantle. The darkness\nof the sepulchre did not permit them to distinguish his features. He\nappeared very calm, and was eating his breakfast with the most perfect\nindifference.\n\nGlenarvan was about to address him, when the native, anticipating him,\nsaid, in an amiable tone, and in excellent English:\n\n\"Be seated, my dear lord; breakfast is awaiting you.\"\n\nIt was Paganel. At his voice all rushed into the tomb, and gazed with\nwonder at the worthy geographer. Paganel was found! The common safety\nwas represented in him. They were going to question him: they wished\nto know how and why he was on the top of the mountain; but Glenarvan\nchecked this unseasonable curiosity.\n\n[Illustration: \"Be seated, my dear lord; breakfast is awaiting you.\"]\n\n\"The savages!\" said he.\n\n\"The savages,\" replied Paganel, shrugging his shoulders, \"are\nindividuals whom I supremely despise.\"\n\n\"But can they not----?\"\n\n\"They! the imbeciles! Come and see them.\"\n\nEach followed Paganel, who issued from the tomb. The Maoris were in the\nsame place, surrounding the foot of the peak, and uttering terrible\ncries.\n\n\"Cry and howl till you are tired, miserable creatures!\" said Paganel.\n\"I defy you to climb this mountain!\"\n\n\"And why?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"Because the chief is buried here; this tomb protects us, and the\nmountain is tabooed.\"\n\n\"Tabooed?\"\n\n\"Yes, my friends; and that is why I took refuge here, as in one of\nthose asylums of the Middle Ages, open to unfortunates.\"\n\nIndeed, the mountain was tabooed, and by this consecration had become\ninaccessible by the superstitious savages.\n\nThe safety of the fugitives was not yet certain, but there was a\nsalutary respite, of which they strove to take advantage. Glenarvan, a\nprey to unspeakable emotion, did not venture a word; while the major\nnodded his head with an air of genuine satisfaction.\n\n\"And now, my friends,\" said Paganel, \"if these brutes expect us to test\ntheir patience they are mistaken.

The night was dark. I saw no one on\nboard.

Everything was\nexplained. But what would the geographer say, when he learned the name\nand destination of the vessel on which he had taken passage?\n\n\"So, Monsieur Paganel,\" said Glenarvan, \"you have chosen Calcutta as\nyour centre of action?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord.

He spoke with a lofty animation, and was\ncarried away in the rapid flight of imagination. It would have been\nas impossible to check him as to stay the Rhine at the Falls of\nSchaffhausen.\n\n\"Monsieur Jacques Paganel,\" said Lord Glenarvan, after a moment\nof silence, \"that is certainly a fine voyage, and one for which\nscience would be very grateful; but I will not further prolong your\nignorance. For the present, you must give up the pleasure of seeing\nIndia.\"\n\n\n\"Give it up! And why?\"\n\n\"Because you are turning your back upon the Indian peninsula.\"\n\n\"How? Captain Burton----\"\n\n\"I am not Captain Burton,\" replied John Mangles.\n\n\"But the Scotia?\"\n\n\"This vessel is not the Scotia.\"\n\nPaganel's amazement cannot be depicted. He looked first at Lord\nGlenarvan, always serious; then at Lady Helena and Miss Grant, whose\nfeatures expressed a sympathetic disappointment; and finally at Captain\nMangles, who was smiling, and the imperturbable major. Then, raising\nhis shoulders and drawing down his glasses from his forehead to his\neyes, he exclaimed,--\n\n\"What a joke!\"\n\nBut at that his eyes fell upon the steering wheel, on which were\ninscribed these two words, thus:\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"The Duncan! the Duncan!\" he cried in a tone of real despair; and,\nleaping down the companion-way, he rushed to his cabin.\n\nWhen the unfortunate geographer had disappeared, no one on board,\nexcept the major, could retain gravity, and the laugh was communicated\neven to the sailors. To mistake the railroad was not so bad; to take\nthe train to Dumbarton, instead of Edinburgh, would do. But to mistake\nthe vessel, and be sailing to Chili, when he wished to go to India, was\nthe height of absent-mindedness.\n\n[Sidenote: ABSENT-MINDEDNESS.]\n\n\"On the whole, I am not astonished at this on the part of Jacques\nPaganel,\" said Glenarvan; \"he is noted for such blunders. He once\npublished a celebrated "}, {"chunk_id": 129, "text": "onda\nfor its wealth and attractions. Besides all this, here was the centre\nof the varied agencies by which the reports were brought in from the\ncompanies established for mining purposes, and also from each isolated\nworker, of the space purchased, the number of feet or yards dug, the\nore extracted, the comparative richness or poverty of the soil here,\nthere, and elsewhere, which in their summarized and aggregate form have\ngreatly helped to a correct knowledge of the comparative and absolute\ngold-bearing value of various spots. Then, in addition to the usual\noperations of a banking establishment, it was here that the ore was\nstored, from hence that it was sent, under government escort and with\ngovernment guarantee, subject to a fixed, though moderate, charge,\nso that the transport to Melbourne, which at first was a dangerous\nand expensive \"middle passage,\" was now as easily and inexpensively\naccomplished as is the transmission of freight from London to Paris.\n\n[Illustration: In the streets, in connection with the strange\nsign-boards and announcements, the novel erections and purposes to\nwhich some of them were adapted, Paganel had a history and commentary\nfor every one.]\n\nOver the whole of this establishment they were conducted by the most\ncourteous and obliging of officials, and the services thus rendered\ncharmed the Frenchman, who was none the less loquacious, and was in\ntruth able even to enlighten his guides.\n\n[Illustration: Here was the mineralogical museum, in which might be\nseen specimens illustrative of all the various ways in which the gold\nhas been found.]\n\n[Sidenote: PLEASING PROGRESS.]\n\nBut his joy culminated when, after some time spent in the hotel, the\nparty left the town, and passed through the \"diggings,\" properly so\ncalled. It was difficult to persuade Paganel and Robert--who kept\ntogether--to come on, in order that they might not leave Ayrton and\nMulready too long in suspense. Now the Frenchman would see just the key\nthat he needed to understand a point not before clear to him; anon you\nmight see him as in the illustration, when he had picked up a pebble\nand was sure that it was in itself so interesting as a mineralogical\nspecimen that he must treasure it up for the Bank of France, so that\nhis own land might have at least one part of Australia. All this was\ndone with such a mingling of childish good-nature and scientific and\nnational pride that it was useless to do anything but laugh, and an\nirrepressible smile came over even the major's features. At length,\nhowever, by drawing him into a lecture, they succeeded in persuading\nhim to follow them; and, as they left the diggings, he told them the\nhistory of the prophecies, the discovery, and the spread of knowledge\nas to the rich auriferous deposits of this part of Australia. He\ncould give them facts and incidents and dates as to the ingress into\nMelbourne, and the exodus therefrom to the diggings, in the year 1852;\nhe told them how the energy and the love of order which characterize\nthe English-speaking peoples had reduced to system, method,\nsubordination, the chaotic surgings and restlessness which marked the\nfirst weeks and months of this new era; and he detailed, as though\nhe had studied the subject to the entire neglect of other matters,\nthe working of the system,--how the land was registered, what was the\nsum paid in the aggregate, how the taxes were collected, wherein the\nsystem had been found faulty. All this occupied much time, and, before\nhe had finished, the cart was in sight, in which Lady Helena and Miss\nGrant reseated themselves, and for the remainder of the day and the\nsucceeding night their progress was in the accustomed order.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\n\nA WARNING.\n\n\nAt sunrise the travelers left the gold regions and crossed the\nfrontiers of the county of Talbot.

They are personal experiences, and will\nscarcely tend to put you on the track you have lost.\"\n\n[Sidenote: REVELATIONS AND DISCLOSURES.]\n\nA keen disappointment was manifest on the features of Glenarvan and\nthe major. They had believed the quartermaster to possess an important\nsecret, and yet he now confessed that his disclosures would be almost\nuseless.\n\nHowever that may be, this avowal of Ayrton, who surrendered himself\nwithout security, singularly affected his hearers, especially when he\nadded, in conclusion:\n\n\"Thus you are forewarned, my lord, that the business will be less\nadvantageous for you than for me.\"\n\n\"No matter,\" replied Glenarvan; \"I accept your proposal, Ayrton. You\nhave my word that you shall be landed at one of the islands of the\nPacific.\"\n\n\"Very well, my lord,\" said he.\n\nWas this strange man pleased with this decision? You might have doubted\nit, for his impassive countenance betrayed no emotion. He seemed as if\nacting for another more than for himself.\n\n\"I am ready to answer,\" continued he.\n\n\"We have no questions to ask you,\" rejoined Glenarvan. \"Tell us what\nyou know, Ayrton, and, in the first place, who you are.\"\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" replied he, \"I am really Tom Ayrton, quartermaster of the\nBritannia. I left Glasgow in Captain Grant's ship on the 12th of March,\n1861. For fourteen months we traversed together the Pacific, seeking\nsome favorable place to found a Scottish colony. Harry Grant was a man\ncapable of performing great deeds, but frequently serious disputes\narose between us. His character did not harmonize with mine. I could\nnot yield; but with Harry Grant, when his resolution is taken, all\nresistance is impossible. He is like iron towards himself and others.\nHowever, I dared to mutiny, and attempted to involve the crew and gain\npossession of the vessel. Whether I did right or wrong is of little\nimportance. However it may be, Captain Grant did not hesitate to land\nme, April 8, 1862, on the west coast of Australia.\"\n\n\"Australia!\" exclaimed the major, interrupting Ayrton's story. \"Then\nyou left the Britannia before her arrival at Callao, where the last\nnews of her was dated?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the quartermaster; \"for the Britannia never stopped at\nCallao while I was on board. If I spoke of Callao at O'Moore's farm, it\nwas your story that gave me this information.\"\n\n\"Go on, Ayrton,\" said Glenarvan.\n\n[Sidenote: MORE BLANKS THAN PRIZES.]\n\n\"I found myself, therefore, abandoned on an almost desert coast, but\nonly twenty miles from the penitentiary of Perth, the capital of\nWestern Australia. Wandering along the shore, I met a band of convicts\nwho had just escaped. I joined them. You will spare me, my lord, the\naccount of my life for two years and a half. It is enough to know that\nI became chief of the runaways, under the name of Ben Joyce. In the\nmonth of September, 1864, I made my appearance at the Irishman's farm,\nand was received as a servant under my true name of Ayrton. Here I\nwaited till an opportunity should be offered to gain possession of a\nvessel. This was my great object. Two months later the Duncan arrived.\nDuring your visit at the farm you related, my lord, the whole story of\nCaptain Grant. I then learned what I had not known, the Britannia's\nstoppage at Callao, the last news of her, dated June, 1862, two months\nafter my abandonment, the finding of the document, the shipwreck of the\nvessel, and finally the important reasons you had for seeking Captain\nGrant in Australia. I did not hesitate, but resolved to appropriate\nthe Duncan,--a marvelous ship, that would have distanced the best of\nthe British navy.

But he gave\nthem a more lengthy and extended narrative of Captain Cook's voyages,\nwhich were the most important in their results as well as the most\ninteresting and tragic in many of their incidents. It was on the 6th\nof October, 1769, that this navigator first landed on the shores which\nhe visited twice afterwards, and each time added greatly to the stock\nof previous knowledge concerning these islands, their productions, and\ntheir inhabitants. By him it was first ascertained that cannibalism was\npracticed by some, if not all, of the tribes at that time; and it was\nvery evident, from the manner of Paganel's narration, that hereabout\nlay the extremely sensitive point of the worthy geographer's fears and\nforebodings. However, he was not deterred from rehearsing how one and\nanother not merely visited, but began to settle, on the island, so that\nin the treaty of 1814 it was formally recognized as belonging to Great\nBritain, and twenty years after was important enough to have a separate\nofficial and governmental establishment.\n\nPaganel also told, at great length, the tales of many of the sad\nincidents which from time to time have marked even the commercial\nintercourse between the European and the Maori; as, for instance, the\nsad tale of conflict and bloodshed connected with the death of Captain\nMarion, a French navigator, in 1772. He had landed near the spot where\nSurville had ill-treated some of the natives and traitorously seized\na son of the chief, Takouri, who yet appeared to welcome this next\nFrench visitant, though remembering none the less the terrible duty of\nvengeance which is felt by the Maori to be so binding.\n\n[Illustration: It was on the sixth of October, 1769, that this\nnavigator (Captain Cook) first landed on the shores.]\n\nFor a long time the cloak of friendship was worn by the natives, the\nmore thoroughly to lull the suspicions of the whites, and to entice a\nlarger number on shore; in which endeavor they succeeded only too well.\nThe French ships being greatly out of repair, Marion was induced to\nfell timber at some distance in the interior, and to establish in this\noccupation a great number of his men, going frequently to them, and\nremaining with them and the apparently friendly chiefs. On one of these\noccasions the Maoris fulfilled their revengeful project with a terrible\nsatisfaction to themselves. Only one man, of all those in the interior,\nmanaged to escape, the commander himself falling a prey to their\nvengeance. They then endeavored to kill the second in command, who,\nwith several others, was nearer to the shore. These, of course, at once\nstarted for their boats; breathless, they reached them, hotly pursued\nto the water's edge by the insatiate savages. Then, safe themselves,\nthe French marksmen picked off the chief, and the previous exultation\nof the aborigines was, even in the hour of their triumph, turned to\nlamentation, coupled with wonder at the terrible power of the white\nman's fire-barrel.\n\n[Illustration: Safe themselves, the French marksmen picked off the\nchief.]\n\nAll this and much more did the geographer narrate; but it must be\nconfessed that he neither spoke, nor did they listen, with the\ncomplacency evinced in his previous"}, {"chunk_id": 51, "text": " Paganel, he did not leave the Indian. He became Thalcave's\nshadow, and could not remain quiet in the presence of a real\nPatagonian, in comparison with whom he would have passed for a dwarf.\nHe overwhelmed the grave Indian with Spanish phrases, to which the\nlatter quietly listened. The geographer studied this time without a\nbook, and was often heard repeating words aloud.\n\n\"If I do not get the accent,\" said he to the major, \"you must not be\nangry with me. Who would have thought that one day a Patagonian would\nteach me Spanish!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\nNEWS OF THE LOST CAPTAIN.\n\n\nAt eight o'clock the next morning Thalcave gave the signal for\ndeparture. The slope was gradual, and the travelers had only to descend\na gentle declivity to the sea.\n\nWhen the Patagonian declined the horse that Glenarvan offered him, the\nlatter thought that he preferred to go on foot, according to the custom\nof certain guides; and indeed, his long legs ought to have made walking\neasy. But he was mistaken.\n\nAt the moment of departure Thalcave whistled in a peculiar manner.\nImmediately a magnificent Argentine horse, of superb form, issued from\na small wood near by, and approached at the call of his master. The\nanimal was perfectly beautiful. His brown color indicated a sound,\nspirited and courageous beast. He had a small and elegantly poised\nhead, widely opening nostrils, a fiery eye, large hams, swelling\nwithers, broad breast, long pasterns, in short, all the qualities that\nconstitute strength and suppleness. The major, like a perfect horseman,\nadmired unreservedly this specimen of the horses of the plains. This\nbeautiful creature was called Thaouka, which means \"bird\" in the\nPatagonian language, and he justly merited this appellation.\n\n[Sidenote: A FRESH START.]\n\nWhen Thalcave was in the saddle, the horse pranced with spirited grace,\nand the Patagonian, a skillful rider, was magnificent to behold. His\noutfit comprised two weapons of the chase, the \"bolas\" and the lasso.\nThe bolas consists of three balls tied together by a leathern string,\nwhich are fastened to the front of the saddle. The Indians frequently\nthrow them the distance of a hundred paces at the animal or enemy that\nthey are pursuing, and with such precision that they twist about their\nlegs and bring them to the ground. It is, therefore, in their hands a\nformidable instrument, and they handle it with surprising dexterity.\nThe lasso, on the contrary, does not leave the hand that wields it. It\nconsists simply of a leathern thong thirty feet in length, terminating\nin a slip-noose which works upon an iron ring. The right hand throws\nthe slip-noose, while the left hand holds the remainder of the lasso,\nthe end of which is firmly tied to the saddle. A long carbine in a\nsling completed the Patagonian's armament.\n\nThalcave, without observing the admiration caused by his natural\ngrace, ease and courage, took the lead, and the party advanced, now\nat a gallop, and now at a walk, for their horses seemed entirely\nunaccustomed to trotting. Robert mounted with much boldness, and\nspeedily convinced Glenarvan of his ability to keep his seat.\n\nOn issuing from the gorges of the Andes, they encountered a great\nnumber of sand-ridges, called \"medanos,\" real waves incessantly\nagitated by the wind, when the roots of the herbage did not confine\nthem to the earth. This sand is of an extreme fineness; and, at the\nleast breath, they saw it float away in light clouds, or form regular\nsand-columns which rose to a considerable height. This spectacle caused\npleasure as well as annoyance to the eyes. Pleasure, for nothing was\nmore curious than these columns, wandering over the plain, struggling,\nmingling, sinking and rising in inexpressible confusion; and annoyance,\nsince an impalpable dust emanated from these innumerable medanos and\npenetrated the eyelids, however tightly they were closed.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThis phenomenon continued during a great part of the day.

Welcome, welcome! I am almost a\nFrenchman,\" cried the commander, shaking the geographer's arm with\nrather painful violence.]\n\n[Sidenote: RAISING A REGIMENT.]\n\nHe then entered into conversation with the commander. Glenarvan would\ngladly have put in a word in regard to his affairs, but the soldier\nwas telling his story, and was not in the mood to be interrupted.\nThis honest man had left France a long time before; and the native\nlanguage was no longer perfectly familiar to him: he had forgotten,\nif not words, at least the manner of combining them. As his visitors\nsoon learned, he had been a sergeant in the French army. Since the\nfoundation of the fort he had not left it, and commanded it by\nappointment from the Argentine government. He was by parentage a\nBasque, and his name was Manuel Ipharaguerre. A year after his arrival\nin the country, Sergeant Manuel was naturalized, joined the Argentine\narmy, and married an honest Indian woman, who had twins,--boys, to be\nsure, for the sergeant's worthy consort would never present him with\ndaughters. Manuel did not think of any other calling than that of the\nsoldier, and hoped, in time, with the help of God, to offer to the\nrepublic a whole battalion of young soldiers.\n\n\"You have seen them?\" said he. \"Charming fellows! Good soldiers! José!\nJuan! Miguel! Pepe! Pepe is only seven years old, and is already biting\nhis cartridge!\"\n\nPepe, hearing himself complimented, joined his two little feet, and\npresented arms with perfect precision.\n\n\"He will do!\" added the sergeant. \"He will be a major--or\nbrigadier-general one day!\"\n\nThis story lasted a quarter of an hour, to Thalcave's great\nastonishment. The Indian could not understand how so many words could\ncome from a single throat. No one interrupted the commander; and even\na French sergeant had to conclude at last, though not without forcing\nhis guests to accompany him to his dwelling. Here they were introduced\nto Madame Ipharaguerre, who appeared to be \"a good-looking person,\" if\nthis expression may be employed in regard to an Indian.\n\nWhen he had exhausted himself, the sergeant asked his guests to what he\nowed the honor of their visit. And now it was their turn to explain.\n\nPaganel, opening the conversation in French, told him of their journey\nacross the Pampas, and ended by asking why the Indians had abandoned\nthe country.\n\n\"War!\" replied the sergeant.\n\n\"War?\"\n\n\"Yes, civil war.\"\n\n\"Civil war?\" rejoined Paganel.\n\n\"Yes, war between Paraguay and Buenos Ayres,\" answered the sergeant.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Why, all the Indians of the north are in the rear of General Flores,\nand those of the plains are plundering.\"\n\n\"But the caziques?\"\n\n\"The caziques with them.\"\n\nThis answer was reported to Thalcave, who shook his head. Indeed,\nhe either did not know, or had forgotten, that a civil war, which\nwas afterwards to involve Brazil, was decimating two-thirds of the\nrepublic. The Indians had everything to gain in these internal\nstruggles, and could not neglect such fine opportunities for plunder.\nThe sergeant, therefore, was not mistaken in attributing this desertion\nof the Pampas to the civil war that was being waged in the northern\npart of the Argentine Provinces.\n\nBut this event disconcerted Glenarvan's hopes. If Captain Grant was\na prisoner of the caziques, he must have been carried by them to the\nnorthern frontiers. Yet how and where to find him? Must they attempt\na perilous and almost useless search to the northern limits of the\nPampas? It was a serious matter, which was to be earnestly considered.\n\nHowever, one important question was still to be asked of the sergeant,\nand the major thought of this, while his companions were looking at\neach other in silence.\n\n\"Hav"}, {"chunk_id": 236, "text": "he plan of founding a Scottish\ncolony on the shores washed by the Pacific Ocean.\n\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK 46597 ***\n"}, {"chunk_id": 3, "text": "ht a coroner was pointing\nout the particulars of a suspicious quest. And Glenarvan was right,\nfor the most insignificant mark in appearance may often lead to an\nimportant discovery.\n\nBefore examining it internally, the bottle was inspected externally.\nIt had a slender neck, the mouth of which was protected by an\niron wire considerably rusted. Its sides were very thick, and\ncapable of supporting a pressure of several atmospheres, betraying\nevidently previous connection with champagne. With these bottles the\nwine-dressers of Aï and Epernay block carriage-wheels without their\nshowing the slightest fracture. This one could, therefore, easily bear\nthe hardships of a long voyage.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"A bottle of the Maison Cliquot,\" said the major quietly; and, as if he\nought to know, his affirmation was accepted without contradiction.\n\n\"My dear major,\" said Lady Helena, \"it matters little what this bottle\nis, provided we know whence it comes.\"\n\n\"We shall know, my dear,\" said Lord Edward, \"and already we can affirm\nthat it has come from a distance.

We must be patient with bottles. If I am\nnot greatly mistaken, this one will itself answer all our questions.\"\n\nAnd so saying, Glenarvan began to scrape off the hard particles that\nprotected the neck. Soon the cork appeared, but very much damaged with\nthe salt water.\n\n\"This is a pity,\" said Glenarvan; \"for if there is any paper in it, it\nwill be in a bad condition.\"\n\n\"That's what I fear,\" replied the major.\n\n\"I will add,\" continued Glenarvan, \"that this badly-corked bottle would\nsoon have sunk; and it is fortunate that this shark swallowed it, and\nbrought it on board of the Duncan.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" interposed Captain Mangles; \"it would have been better,\nhowever, had it been caught in the open sea on a well-known latitude\nand longitude. We could then, by studying the atmospheric and marine\ncurrents, have discovered the course traversed; but with a guide like\none of these sharks, that travel against wind and tide, we cannot know\nwhence it comes.\"\n\n\"We shall soon see,\" answered Glenarvan. At the same time he drew out\nthe cork with the greatest care, and a strong saline odor permeated the\ncabin.\n\n\"Well?\" said Lady Helena, with a truly feminine impatience.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Glenarvan; \"I am not mistaken!

It was\nnecessary to use a hammer, for the stony covering had acquired the\nhardness of granite.

People seemed as though they could not show him enough\nattention.\n\nJust at this time an amiable lady of thirty, none other than the\nmajor's cousin, a little eccentric herself, but still agreeable and\ncharming, fell in love with the geographer's peculiarities. Paganel was\nfar from being insensible to Miss Arabella's attractions, yet did not\ndare to declare his sentiments. The major accordingly undertook the\npart of Cupid's messenger between these two congenial hearts, and even\ntold Paganel that marriage was \"the last blunder\" that he could commit.\nBut the geographer was very much embarrassed, and, strangely enough,\ncould not summon courage to speak for himself.\n\n[Illustration: Early in the afternoon the travelers reached Malcolm\nCastle, amidst the hurrahs of their tenantry and friends.]\n\n\"Does not Miss Arabella please you?\" MacNabb would say to him.\n\n\"Oh, major, she is charming!\" cried Paganel,--\"a thousand times too\ncharming for me; and, if I must tell you, would please me better if she\nwere less so.

In spite of the\nrepresentations of his friends, he dared not go back to France, for\nfear of exposing the whole Geographical Society in his person to the\njests and railleries of the caricaturists.\n\nThe return of Captain Grant to Scotland was welcomed as a cause for\nnational rejoicing, and he became the popular man of old Caledonia.

They\nwhirled along with indescribable fury. It was certain death to brave\nthis torrent.

During the period of a year Harry Grant landed\nat the principal ports of Oceanica, opposing unjustifiable captures,\nand often a victim to the hostility of unjust traders. He found,\nhowever, an important point on the western coast of Papua. Here the\nestablishment of a Scottish colony appeared to him feasible, and its\nprosperity assured. After examining Papua, the Britannia sailed to\nCallao for provisions, and left that port on the 30th of May, 1862, to\nreturn to Europe by the way of the Indian Ocean and the Cape. Three\nweeks after her departure, a terrible tempest disabled her. It became\nnecessary to cut away the masts. A leak was discovered in the hold,\nwhich they did not succeed in stopping. The crew were soon overtasked\nand exhausted. The pumps could not be worked. For eight days the\nvessel was at the mercy of the storm. There were six feet of water\nin her hold, and she gradually foundered. The boats had been washed\noverboard, and the crew had given themselves up for lost, when on the\nnight of June 22nd, as Paganel had rightly interpreted, they descried\nthe eastern coast of Australia. The vessel soon stranded. A violent\nshock was felt. At this moment Ayrton, borne by a wave, was cast into\nthe midst of the breakers, and lost all consciousness. When he came to\nhimself, he was in the hands of the natives, who carried him into the\ninterior of the country. Since then he had heard nothing more of the\nBritannia, and naturally supposed that she had been wrecked, with all\non board, on the dangerous reefs of Twofold Bay.\n\nThis was Ayrton's story, which elicited more than once exclamations of\nsympathy. The major could not justly doubt its correctness; and after\nthis recital the quartermaster's own experiences possessed a more real\ninterest. Indeed, thanks to the document, they no longer doubted that\nCaptain Grant had survived the shipwreck with two of his sailors. From\nthe fate of the one they could fairly conjecture that of the other.\n\nAyrton was invited to tell of his own adventures, which was soon and\nsimply done. The shipwrecked sailor, prisoner of a native tribe, was\ncarried into the interior regions watered by the Darling. Here he led\na very wretched existence, because the tribe itself was miserable; but\nhe was not maltreated. For two long years he endured a painful slavery.\nHowever, the hope of regaining his liberty sustained his courage. He\nwatched for the least opportunity of escaping, although his flight\nwould plunge him into the midst of innumerable perils. One night\nin October he eluded the vigilance of the natives, and took refuge\nin the depths of extensive forests. For a month, living on roots,\nedible ferns, and the gum of the mimosa, often overcome by despair,\nhe wandered in those vast solitudes, with the sun as his guide by\nday and the stars by night. In this way he crossed marshes, rivers,\nmountains, in short, all that uninhabited portion of country that few\ntravelers have explored. At last, exhausted and almost dead, he reached\nthe hospitable dwelling of Mr. O'Moore, where his labor insured him a\ncomfortable livelihood.\n\n\"And if Ayrton is pleased with me,\" said the Irish colonist, when the\nstory was finished, \"I cannot but be pleased with him. He is an honest\nand intelligent man, a good worker, and, if he chooses, this house\nshall long be at his service.\"\n\nAyrton thanked Mr. O'Moore, and waited for further questions. He\nprobably thought, however, that the legitimate curiosity of his hearers\nought to be satisfied.

'A cunning\nman, this Ben Joyce,' said the farrier; 'a famous quartermaster, with\nhis invented shipwreck. If his plan succeeds, it will be a stroke of\nfortune. Devilish Ayrton! Call him Ben Joyce, for he has well earned\nhis name.' These rascals then left the wood of gum-trees. I knew what\nI wished, and returned to the encampment with the certainty that all\nthe convicts in Australia are not reformed, in spite of Paganel's\narguments.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Glenarvan, whose face was pale with anger, \"Ayrton has\nbrought us here to rob and assassinate us?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the major.\n\n\"And, since leaving the Wimerra, his band has followed and watched us,\nwaiting for a favorable opportunity?\"\n\n[Sidenote: FROM DEPTH TO DEPTH.]\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"But this wretch is not, then, a sailor of the Britannia? He has stolen\nhis name and contract?\"\n\nAll eyes were turned towards MacNabb, who must have considered this\nmatter.\n\n\"These,\" replied he, in his calm voice, \"are the proofs that can be\nderived from this obscure state of affairs. In my opinion this man's\nreal name is Ayrton. Ben Joyce is his fighting title. It is certain\nthat he knows Harry Grant, and has been quartermaster on board the\nBritannia. These facts, proved already by the precise details given\nby Ayrton, are still further corroborated by the conversation of the\nconvicts that I have related. Let us not, therefore, be led astray\nby vain conjectures, but only be certain that Ayrton is Ben Joyce, a\nsailor of the Britannia, now chief of a band of convicts.\"\n\nThe major's explanation was accepted as conclusive.\n\n\"Now,\" replied Glenarvan, \"will you tell me how and why Harry Grant's\nquartermaster is in Australia?\"\n\n\"How, I do not know,\" said MacNabb; \"and the police declare they know\nno more than I on the subject. Why, it is also impossible for me to\nsay. Here is a mystery that the future will explain.\"\n\n\"The police do not even know the identity of Ayrton and Ben Joyce,\"\nsaid Captain Mangles.\n\n\"You are right, John,\" replied the major; \"and such information would\nbe likely to facilitate their search.\"\n\n\"This unfortunate, then,\" remarked Lady Helena, \"intruded into\nO'Moore's farm with a criminal intention?\"\n\n\"There is no doubt of it,\" continued MacNabb. \"He was meditating\nsome hostile attack upon the Irishman, when a better opportunity was\noffered. Chance threw us in his way. He heard Glenarvan's story of the\nshipwreck, and, like a bold man, he promptly decided to take part in\nthe expedition. At the Wimerra he communicated with one of his friends,\nthe farrier of Black Point, and thus left distinguishable traces of\nour course. His band followed us. A poisonous plant enabled him to\ngradually kill our oxen and horses. Then, at the proper moment, he\nentangled us in the marshes of the Snowy, and surrendered us to the\nconvicts he commanded.\"\n\nEverything possible had been said concerning Ben Joyce. His past had\njust been reviewed by the major, and the wretch appeared as he was,--a\nbold and formidable criminal. His intentions had been clearly proved,\nand required, on the part of Glenarvan, extreme vigilance. Fortunately,\nthere was less to fear from the detected bandit than the secret traitor.\n\nBut one serious fact appeared from this explanation. No one had yet\nthought of it; only Mary Grant, disregarding the past, looked forward\nto the future. Captain Mangles first saw her pale and disconsolate. He\nunderstood what was passing in her mind.\n\n\"Miss Mary!\" cried he, \"you are weeping!\"\n\n\"What is the matter, my child?\" asked Lady Helena.\n\n\"My father, madam, my father!\" replied the young girl.\n\nShe could not continue. But a sudden revelation dawned on the mind of\neach. They comprehended Mary's grief, why the tears flowed from her\neyes, why the "}, {"chunk_id": 115, "text": "rough the forests, and to the eastern coast, there was another chance\nof success. Glenarvan felt the importance of this arrangement, and was\ntherefore particularly desirous of obtaining the services of Captain\nGrant's companion. He inquired of his host whether he was willing for\nhim to propose to Ayrton to accompany them. Mr. O'Moore consented,\nthough not without regret at losing so good an assistant.\n\n\"Well, Ayrton, will you aid us in our search for the sailors of the\nBritannia?\"\n\nThe quartermaster did not answer immediately; he seemed to hesitate for\na few moments, but finally, after reflecting, said:\n\n\"Yes, my lord, I will follow you; and, if I do not set you upon the\ntrack of Captain Grant, I will at least guide you to the place where\nhis vessel was wrecked.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" replied Glenarvan.\n\n\"One question, my lord.\"\n\n\"Ask it.\"\n\n\"Where will you join the Duncan?\"\n\n\"At Melbourne, if we do not cross Australia; on the eastern coast, if\nour search is continued so far.\"\n\n\"But the captain of the Duncan?\"\n\n\"He will await my orders at Melbourne.\"\n\n\"Very well, my lord,\" said Ayrton; \"rely on me.\"\n\n\"I will,\" replied Glenarvan.\n\nThe quartermaster was heartily thanked by the travelers. Captain\nGrant's children lavished upon him their most grateful caresses. All\nwere delighted at his decision, except the colonist, who would lose\nin him an intelligent and faithful assistant. But he understood the\nimportance that Glenarvan attached to this new addition to his force,\nand was resigned. He had, moreover, engaged to furnish them with the\nmeans of conveyance for the journey, and, this business being settled,\nthe party returned on board.\n\n[Illustration: This business being settled, the party returned on\nboard.]\n\nEverything was now changed; all hesitation had vanished. These\ncourageous searchers were no longer to wander on blindly. Harry Grant,\nthey believed, had found a refuge on the continent, and each heart\nwas full of the satisfaction that certainty brings when it takes the\nplace of doubt. In two months, perhaps, the Duncan would land the lost\ncaptain on the shores of Scotland.\n\nWhen Captain Mangles seconded the proposal that they should attempt to\ncross Australia with the ladies, he supposed that this time he would\naccompany the expedition. He therefore consulted Glenarvan on the\nsubject, and brought forward various arguments in his own favor, such\nas his desire to take part in the search for his countryman, and his\nusefulness in the undertaking.\n\n\"One question, John,\" said Glenarvan. \"You have absolute confidence in\nyour mate?\"\n\n\"Absolute,\" replied he. \"Tom Austin is a good sailor. He will take the\nDuncan to Melbourne, repair her thoroughly, and bring her back at the\nappointed time. He is a man devoted to duty and discipline, and will\nnever take the responsibility of changing or delaying the execution of\nan order. You can rely upon him as fully as on myself.\"\n\n\"Very well, captain,\" replied Glenarvan; \"you shall accompany us; for,\"\nadded he, smiling, \"you certainly ought to be present when we find Mary\nGrant's father.\"\n\n\"Ah, my lord!\" murmured Captain Mangles, with something like a blush\nupon his swarthy cheeks.\n\n[Sidenote: A PALACE-CART.]\n\nThe next day the captain, accompanied by the carpenter and by the\nsailors loaded with provisions, returned to the farm of Mr. O'Moore,\nwho was to assist him in the preparations. All the family were waiting\nfor him, ready to work under his orders. Ayrton was there, and freely\ngave them the benefit of his experience. He and his employer were\nagreed on this point, that the ladies ought to make the journey in an\nox-cart, and the gentlemen on horseback. The colonist could procure\nthem the animals and vehicle.\n\nThe vehicle was a cart twenty feet long and covered with an awning,\nthe whole resting upon four wheels, without spokes, felloes, or tires.\nThe front wheels were a long way from the hind ones, and were joined\ntogether by a rude contrivance that made it impossible to turn short.\nTo the body of the cart was a"}, {"chunk_id": 113, "text": "hed\nthe hospitable dwelling of Mr. O'Moore, where his labor insured him a\ncomfortable livelihood.\n\n\"And if Ayrton is pleased with me,\" said the Irish colonist, when the\nstory was finished, \"I cannot but be pleased with him.

He\nprobably thought, however, that the legitimate curiosity of his hearers\nought to be satisfied. What could he say that had not been repeated\na hundred times already? Glenarvan was, therefore, about to open the\nconversation on a new topic, to profit by the information received from\nAyrton, when the major, addressing him, said:\n\n\"You were quartermaster of the Britannia?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Ayrton.\n\nBut perceiving that a certain feeling of distrust, a doubt, however\nslight, had suggested this inquiry, he added,--\n\n\"I saved my contract from the wreck.\"\n\nHe immediately left the room in search of this authoritative document.\nDuring his absence, which lasted but a few moments, Mr. O'Moore said:\n\n\"My lord, I will answer for it that Ayrton is an honest man. During the\ntwo months that he has been in my employ, I have had no fault to find\nwith him. I knew the story of his shipwreck and captivity. He is a true\nman, and worthy of your entire confidence.\"\n\nGlenarvan was about to answer that he had never doubted Ayrton's\nhonesty, when the latter returned and presented his contract. It was a\npaper signed by the owners of the Britannia and Captain Grant, whose\nwriting Mary recognized immediately. It stated that \"Tom Ayrton, able\nseaman, was engaged as quartermaster on board the brig Britannia of\nGlasgow.\" There was, therefore, no possible doubt of Ayrton's identity,\nfor it would have been difficult to suppose that this contract could be\nin his hands and not belong to him.\n\n[Sidenote: ENTANGLEMENTS.]\n\n\"Now,\" said Glenarvan, \"I appeal to you all for advice as to what is\nbest to be done. Your advice, Ayrton, would be particularly valuable,\nand I should be much obliged if you would give it to us.\"\n\nThe sailor reflected a few moments, and then replied:\n\n\"I thank you, my lord, for the confidence you place in me, and hope to\nshow myself worthy of it. I have some knowledge of the country, and of\nthe customs of the natives; and, if I can be of use to you----\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" replied Glenarvan.\n\n\"I think, like you,\" continued Ayrton, \"that Captain Grant and his two\nsailors were saved from the shipwreck; but, since they have not reached\nthe English possessions, since they have not reappeared, I doubt not\nthat their fate was the same as my own, and that they are prisoners of\nthe natives.\"\n\n\"You repeat, Mr. Ayrton, the arguments that I have already\nsubstantiated,\" said Paganel. \"The shipwrecked seamen are evidently\nprisoners of the natives, as they feared. But ought we to suppose that,\nlike you, they have been carried to the north?\"\n\n\"It is quite likely, sir,\" replied Ayrton. \"The hostile tribes would\nhardly remain in the neighborhood of the English provinces.\"\n\n\"This fact will complicate our search,\" said Glenarvan, quite\ndisconcerted. \"How shall we find the traces of the prisoners in the\ninterior of so vast a continent?\"\n\nA prolonged silence followed this remark. Lady Helena frequently\ncast a questioning glance at her companions, but without eliciting a\nresponsive sign. Paganel himself was silent, contrary to his custom.\nHis usual ingenuity now failed him. Captain Mangles paced the room with\nlong strides, as if he had been on the deck of his vessel, involved in\nsome difficulty.\n\n\"And you, Mr. Ayrton,\" said Lady Helena, at length, to the\nquartermaster, \"what would you do?\"\n\n\"Madam,\" replied he, promptly, \"I should re-embark on board the Duncan,\nand go straight to the place of the shipwreck. There I should act\naccording to circumstances, or indications that chance might furnish.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" said Glenarvan; \"but we must wait till the Duncan is\nrepaired.\"\n\n\"Ah! you"}]}

These convicts are twenty-nine in\nnumber, and are commanded by a certain Ben Joyce, a dangerous criminal,\nwho arrived in Australia several months ago in some way, and upon whom\njustice has not yet succeeded in laying hands.

And now, by a strange fatality,\nthe convict was in their power.\n\n\"Where is he?\" asked Glenarvan quickly.\n\n\"In a cabin in the forecastle,\" replied Tom Austin, \"closely guarded.\"\n\n\"Why this confinement?\"\n\n[Sidenote: AN UNOFFICIAL TRIBUNAL.]\n\n\"Because, when Ayrton saw that the yacht was sailing for New Zealand,\nhe flew into a passion; because he attempted to force me to change the\nship's course; because he threatened me; and, finally, because he urged\nmy men to a mutiny.

Breakfast, which they so much needed, was ready. They took\nseats at the table, but did not speak of Ayrton.\n\nHowever, when the meal was ended, and the passengers had assembled on\ndeck, Glenarvan informed them of the quartermaster's presence on board.\nAt the same time he declared his intention of sending for him.\n\n\"Can I be released from attending this tribunal?\" asked Lady Helena.\n\"I confess to you, my dear Edward, that the sight of this unfortunate\nwould be very painful to me.\"\n\n\"It is only to confront him, Helena,\" replied Glenarvan. \"Remain,\nif you can. Ben Joyce should see himself face to face with all his\nintended victims.\"\n\nLady Helena yielded to this request, and Mary Grant and she took their\nplaces beside him, while around them stood the major, Paganel, Captain\nMangles, Robert, Wilson, Mulready, and Olbinett, all who had suffered\nso severely by the convict's treason. The crew of the yacht, who did\nnot yet understand the seriousness of these proceedings, maintained a\nprofound silence.\n\n\"Call Ayrton!\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVI.\n\nAYRTON'S OBSTINACY.\n\n\nAyrton soon made his appearance. He crossed the deck with a confident\nstep, and ascended the poop-stairs. His eyes had a sullen look, his\nteeth were set, and his fists clinched convulsively. His bearing\ndisplayed neither exultation nor humility. As soon as he was in Lord\nGlenarvan's presence, he folded his arms, and calmly and silently\nwaited to be questioned:\n\n\"Ayrton,\" said Glenarvan, \"here we all are, as you see, on board the\nDuncan, that you would have surrendered to Ben Joyce's accomplices.\"\n\nAt these words the lips of the quartermaster slightly trembled. A quick\nblush colored his hard features,--not the sign of remorse, but the\nshame of defeat. He was prisoner on this yacht that he had meant to\ncommand as master, and his fate was soon to be decided.\n\nHowever, he made no reply. Glenarvan waited patiently, but Ayrton still\npersisted in maintaining an obstinate silence.\n\n\"Speak, Ayrton; what have you to say?\" continued Glenarvan.\n\nThe convict hesitated, and the lines of his forehead were strongly\ncontracted. At last he said, in a calm voice:\n\n\"I have nothing to say, my lord. I was foolish enough to let myself be\ntaken. Do what you please.\"\n\n[Sidenote: A DUMB PRISONER.]\n\nHaving given his answer, the quartermaster turned his eyes toward\nthe coast that extended along the west, and affected a profound\nindifference for all that was passing around him. You would have\nthought, to look at him, that he was a stranger to this serious affair.\n\nBut Glenarvan had resolved to be patient. A powerful motive urged\nhim to ascertain certain circumstances o"}, {"chunk_id": 142, "text": " brandy, and\nwhisky of his tavern, and scarcely ever saw any one but squatters or\nherdsmen.\n\nHe replied in an ill-humored way to the questions that were addressed\nhim; but his answers sufficed to determine Ayrton upon his course.\nGlenarvan, however, remunerated the tavern-keeper for the little\ntrouble they had given him, and was about to leave the inn, when a\nplacard, affixed to the wall, attracted his attention. It was a notice\nof the colonial police, detailing the escape of the convicts from\nPerth, and setting a price upon the head of Ben Joyce--a hundred pounds\nsterling to any one who should deliver him up.\n\n\"Indeed,\" said Glenarvan, \"that is a rascal worth hanging.\"\n\n\"And especially worth taking,\" replied Ayrton. \"A hundred pounds! What\na sum! He is not worth it.\"\n\n\"As for the inn-keeper,\" added Glenarvan, as he left the room, \"I\nscarcely put faith in him, despite his placard.\"\n\n\"Nor I either,\" said Ayrton.\n\nGlenarvan and the quartermaster rejoined the party, and they all\nproceeded to where a narrow pass wound across the chain. Here they\nbegan the ascent.\n\n[Sidenote: ANOTHER DEATH.]\n\nBut it was an arduous task. More than once the ladies and their\ncompanions had to dismount, and it was often necessary to push the\nwheels of the heavy vehicle at some steep ascent, or to hold it\nback along the edge of some dangerous precipice. The oxen, as they\ncould not work to advantage at sudden turns, had frequently to be\nunyoked, and the cart blocked to prevent it from sliding back. Ayrton\nwas repeatedly forced to bring the already exhausted horses to his\nassistance.\n\nWhether this exertion was too prolonged, or whether from some other\ncause, one of the horses gave out during the ascent. He fell suddenly,\nwithout an instant's warning. It was Mulready's horse; and when the\nsailor attempted to help him up, he found that he was dead. Ayrton\nexamined the animal carefully, but did not seem to understand the cause\nof this sudden death.\n\n\"The beast must have burst a blood-vessel,\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\"Evidently,\" replied Ayrton.\n\n\"Take my horse, Mulready,\" added Glenarvan; \"I will join Lady Helena in\nthe cart.\"\n\nMulready obeyed, and the little party continued their fatiguing ascent,\nabandoning the body to the crows.\n\nThe next day they began the descent, which was much more rapid. During\nits course a violent hail-storm burst on them, and they were forced to\nseek a shelter beneath the rocks. Not hailstones, but pieces of ice as\nlarge as one's hand, were precipitated from the angry clouds. A sling\ncould not have hurled them with greater force, and several sharp blows\nwarned Paganel and Robert to be on their guard. The cart was pierced\nthrough in many places: indeed, few roofs could have resisted the fall\nof these cutting missiles, some of which froze to the trunks of the\ntrees. It was necessary to wait for the end of this avalanche, for fear\nof being stoned to death, and it was an hour before the party regained\nthe steep path, still slippery with icy incrustations. At evening the\ncart, considerably shattered, but still firm on its wooden wheels,\ndescended the last slopes of the Alps, between tall solitary pines, and\nreached the plains of Gippsland.\n\n[Illustration: Not hailstones, but pieces of ice as large as one's\nhand, were precipitated from the angry clouds.]\n\n[Sidenote: DIVIDED COUNSELS.]\n\nAll were impatient to gain their destination, the Pacific Ocean,\nwhere the Britannia had been wrecked. There only could traces of the\nshipwrecked seamen be found, and not in these desert regions. Ayrton\nurged Lord Glenarvan to send an order to the Duncan to repair to the\ncoast, that he might have at his disposal all the aid possible in his\nsearch. In his opinion they ought to take advantage of the Lucknow\nroad, which would lead them to Melbourne. Afterwards this might be\ndifficult, for highways leading directly to the capital would be\nabsolutely wanting.\n\nThis advice of the quartermaster seemed reasonable. Paganel seconded\nit.

He has stolen\nhis name and contract?\"\n\nAll eyes were turned towards MacNabb, who must have considered this\nmatter.\n\n\"These,\" replied he, in his calm voice, \"are the proofs that can be\nderived from this obscure state of affairs. In my opinion this man's\nreal name is Ayrton. Ben Joyce is his fighting title. It is certain\nthat he knows Harry Grant, and has been quartermaster on board the\nBritannia. These facts, proved already by the precise details given\nby Ayrton, are still further corroborated by the conversation of the\nconvicts that I have related. Let us not, therefore, be led astray\nby vain conjectures, but only be certain that Ayrton is Ben Joyce, a\nsailor of the Britannia, now chief of a band of convicts.\"\n\nThe major's explanation was accepted as conclusive.\n\n\"Now,\" replied Glenarvan, \"will you tell me how and why Harry Grant's\nquartermaster is in Australia?\"\n\n\"How, I do not know,\" said MacNabb; \"and the police declare they know\nno more than I on the subject. Why, it is also impossible for me to\nsay. Here is a mystery that the future will explain.\"\n\n\"The police do not even know the identity of Ayrton and Ben Joyce,\"\nsaid Captain Mangles.\n\n\"You are right, John,\" replied the major; \"and such information would\nbe likely to facilitate their search.\"\n\n\"This unfortunate, then,\" remarked Lady Helena, \"intruded into\nO'Moore's farm with a criminal intention?\"\n\n\"There is no doubt of it,\" continued MacNabb. \"He was meditating\nsome hostile attack upon the Irishman, when a better opportunity was\noffered. Chance threw us in his way. He heard Glenarvan's story of the\nshipwreck, and, like a bold man, he promptly decided to take part in\nthe expedition. At the Wimerra he communicated with one of his friends,\nthe farrier of Black Point, and thus left distinguishable traces of\nour course. His band followed us. A poisonous plant enabled him to\ngradually kill our oxen and horses. Then, at the proper moment, he\nentangled us in the marshes of the Snowy, and surrendered us to the\nconvicts he commanded.\"\n\nEverything possible had been said concerning Ben Joyce. His past had\njust been reviewed by the major, and the wretch appeared as he was,--a\nbold and formidable criminal. His intentions had been clearly proved,\nand required, on the part of Glenarvan, extreme vigilance. Fortunately,\nthere was less to fear from the detected bandit than the secret traitor.\n\nBut one serious fact appeared from this explanation. No one had yet\nthought of it; only Mary Grant, disregarding the past, looked forward\nto the future. Captain Mangles first saw her pale and disconsolate. He\nunderstood what was passing in her mind.\n\n\"Miss Mary!\" cried he, \"you are weeping!\"\n\n\"What is the matter, my child?\" asked Lady Helena.\n\n\"My father, madam, my father!\" replied the young girl.\n\nShe could not continue. But a sudden revelation dawned on the mind of\neach. They comprehended Mary's grief, why the tears flowed from her\neyes, why the "}, {"chunk_id": 158, "text": "of a mile distant. Glenarvan, pushing back MacNabb,\nwas advancing along the path, when, not far from the cart, these words\nwere uttered:\n\n\"Help! help!\"\n\nIt was a plaintive and despairing voice. Captain Mangles and the major\nrushed towards it. In a few moments they perceived, on the edge of\nthe coppice, a human form that was dragging itself along and groaning\npiteously. It was Mulready, wounded and half dead. When his companions\nraised him, they felt their hands dabbling in blood. The rain now\nincreased, and the wind howled through the branches of the dead trees.\nIn the midst of these terrific gusts, Glenarvan, the major, and the\ncaptain bore the body of Mulready.\n\nOn arriving at the cart, Paganel, Robert, Wilson, and Olbinett came\nout, and Lady Helena gave up her room to the poor sailor. The major\ntook off Mulready's vest, wet with blood and rain. He discovered the\nwound. It was a poniard stab, which the unfortunate had received in his\nright side.\n\nMacNabb dressed it skillfully. Whether the weapon had reached the vital\nparts, he could not say. A stream of bright-red blood spurted forth,\nwhile the paleness and the swoon of the wounded man proved that he had\nbeen seriously injured. The major accordingly placed upon the opening\nof the wound, after first washing it with fresh water, a thick wad of\ntinder, and then a few layers of lint, confined by a bandage, and thus\nsucceeded in stopping the hemorrhage. The patient was then laid on his\nside, his head and breast raised, and Lady Helena gave him a refreshing\ndraught.\n\nAt the end of a quarter of an hour, the wounded man, who had been\nmotionless till then, made a movement. His eyes half opened, his lips\nmurmured disconnected words, and the major, putting down his ear, heard\nhim say:\n\n\"My lord--the letter--Ben Joyce----\"\n\n[Sidenote: A DAY OF DOUBT.]\n\nThe major repeated these words, and glanced at his companions. What did\nMulready mean? Ben Joyce had attacked the sailor, but why? Was it not\nsimply for the purpose of preventing him from reaching the Duncan? This\nletter--Glenarvan examined the sailor's pockets. The letter addressed\nto Tom Austin was gone.\n\nThe night passed in anxiety and anguish. They feared every moment that\nthe wounded man would die. A burning fever consumed him. Lady Helena\nand Mary Grant, as though his sisters, did not leave him; never was\npatient better nursed, or by more tender hands.\n\nDay appeared. The rain had ceased. Heavy clouds still rolled along\nthe vault of the sky, and the earth was strewn with the fragments of\nbranches. The clay, soaked by floods of water, had yielded; and the\nsides of the cart became unsteady, but sank no deeper.\n\nCaptain Mangles, Paganel, and Glenarvan took a tour of exploration\naround the camp. They traversed the path still marked with blood, but\nfound no trace of Ben Joyce or his band. They went to the place where\nthe attack had been made. Here two corpses lay on the ground, shot\nby Mulready. One was the farrier of Black Point. His face, which had\nmortified, was a horrible sight.\n\nGlenarvan did not pursue his investigations farther, prudence\nforbidding. He therefore returned to the cart, much alarmed by the\nseriousness of the situation.\n\n\"We cannot think of sending another messenger to Melbourne,\" said he.\n\n\"But we must,\" replied Captain Mangles; \"and I will make the attempt,\nsince my sailor has failed.\"\n\n\"No, John. You have not even a horse to carry you these two hundred\nmiles.\"\n\nIndeed, Mulready's horse, the only one that remained, had not\nreappeared. Had he fallen beneath the shots of the murderers? Was he\nrunning wild over the desert? Had the convicts captured him?\n\n[Illustration: In the midst of these terrific gusts, Glenarvan, the\nmajor, and the captain bore the body of Mulready.]\n\n[Sidenote: RESOLUTION, AND RECOVERY.]\n\n\"Whatever happens,\" continued Glenarvan, \"we will separate no more.\nLet us wait eight or fifteen days, till the waters of the river resume\ntheir natural level.

The flag of England fluttered at her yard-arm, while at\nthe top of the mainmast floated a blue pennon, bearing the initials\nE. G., worked in gold and surmounted by a ducal coronet. The yacht\nwas called the Duncan, and belonged to Lord Glenarvan, one of the\nsixteen Scottish peers sitting in the House of Lords, and also a most\ndistinguished member of the \"Royal Thames Yacht Club,\" so celebrated\nthroughout the United Kingdom.\n\nLord Edward Glenarvan was on board with his young wife, Lady Helena,\nand one of his cousins, Major MacNabb. The Duncan, newly constructed,\nhad just been making a trial voyage several miles beyond the Frith of\nClyde, and was now on her return to Glasgow. Already Arran Island was\nappearing on the horizon, when the look-out signaled an enormous fish\nthat was sporting in the wake of the yacht. The captain, John Mangles,\nat once informed Lord Glenarvan of the fact, who mounted on deck with\nMajor MacNabb, and asked the captain what he thought of the animal.\n\n\"Indeed, your lordship,\" replied Captain Mangles, \"I think it is a\nshark of large proportions.\"\n\n\"A shark in these regions!\" exclaimed Glenarvan.\n\n\"Without doubt,\" replied the captain. \"This fish belongs to a species\nof sharks that are found in all seas and latitudes. It is the\n'balance-fish,' and, if I am not greatly mistaken, we shall have an\nencounter with one of these fellows. If your lordship consents, and it\npleases Lady Helena to witness such a novel chase, we will soon see\nwhat we have to deal with.\"\n\n\"What do you think, MacNabb?\" said Lord Glenarvan to the major; \"are\nyou of a mind to try the adventure?\"\n\n\"I am of whatever opinion pleases you,\" answered the major, calmly.\n\n\"Besides,\" continued Captain Mangles, \"we cannot too soon exterminate\nthese terrible monsters. Let us improve the opportunity, and, if your\nlordship pleases, it shall be an exciting scene as well as a good\naction.\"\n\n\"Very well, captain,\" said Lord Glenarvan. He then summoned Lady\nHelena, who joined him on deck, tempted by the exciting sport.\n\nThe sea was magnificent. You could easily follow along its surface the\nrapid motions of the fish, as it plunged and rose again with surprising\nagility. Captain Mangles gave his orders, and the sailors threw over\nthe starboard ratling a stout rope, to which was fastened a hook baited\nwith a thick piece of pork.\n\n[Sidenote: THE LAST MOUTHFUL.]\n\nThe shark, although still at a distance of fifty yards, scented the\nbait offered to his voracity. He rapidly approached the yacht. You\ncould see his fins, gray at their extremity and black at their base,\nbeat the waves with violence, while his \"caudal appendage\" kept him\nin a rigorously straight line. As he advanced, his great glaring eyes\nseemed inflamed with eagerness, and his yawning jaws, when he turned,\ndisclosed a quadruple row of teeth. His head was large, and shaped like\na double-headed hammer. Captain Mangles was right. It was a very large\nspecimen of the most rapacious family of sharks,--the \"balance fish\" of\nthe English and the \"jew-fish\" of the Provençals.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nAll on board of the Duncan followed the movements of the shark with\nlively attention. The animal was soon within reach of the hook; he\nturned upon his back, in order to seize it better, and the enormous\nbait disappeared down his vast gullet. At the same time he hooked\nhimself, giving the line a violent shake, whereupon the sailors\nhoisted the huge creature by means of a pulley at the end of the\nyard-arm.\n\nThe shark struggled violently at feeling himself drawn from his natural\nelement, but his struggles were of no avail. A rope with a slip-noose\nconfined his tail and paralyzed his movements. A few moments afterward\nhe was hauled over the ratlings, and precipitated upon the deck of the\nyacht. One of the sailors at once approached him, not without caution,\nand with a vigorous blow of the hatchet cut off the formidable tail of\nthe animal.\n\nThe chase was ended, and there was nothing more to fear from the\nmonster.

Cross the river at Kemple Pier bridge, go to the coast,\nand wait for me. I will find means to bring you on board. With the\ncrew once at sea, and a vessel like the Duncan, we shall be masters\nof the Indian Ocean.' 'Hurrah for Ben Joyce!' cried the convicts.\nMulready's horse was then led up, and Ben Joyce disappeared at a gallop\non the Lucknow road, while the band proceeded southeastward to the\nSnowy River. Mulready, although severely wounded, had strength to drag\nhimself within two hundred paces of the encampment, where we picked him\nup almost dead. This,\" added MacNabb, \"is Mulready's sad story. You\nunderstand now why the courageous sailor wished so much to speak.\"\n\nThis revelation terrified all.\n\n\"Pirates! pirates!\" cried Glenarvan. \"My crew massacred, my Duncan in\nthe hands of these bandits!\"\n\n\"Yes, for Ben Joyce will surprise the vessel,\" replied the major, \"and\nthen----\"\n\n\"Well, we must reach the coast before these wretches,\" said Paganel.\n\n\"But how cross the Snowy?\" asked Wilson.\n\n\"Like them,\" answered Glenarvan. \"They will cross Kemple Pier bridge,\nand we will do the same.\"\n\n\"But what will become of Mulready?\" inquired Lady Helena.\n\n\"We will take turns in carrying him. Shall I give up my defenceless\ncrew to Ben Joyce's band?\"\n\nThe plan of crossing Kemple Pier bridge was practicable, but perilous.\nThe convicts might locate themselves at this point to defend it. It\nwould be at least thirty against seven! But there are moments when we\ndo not think of these things, when we must advance at all hazards.\n\n\"My lord,\" said Captain Mangles, at length, \"before risking our\nlast chance, before venturing towards the bridge, it is prudent to\nreconnoitre it first. I will undertake this.\"\n\n\"I will accompany you, captain,\" replied Paganel.\n\n[Sidenote: THE BURNED BRIDGE.]\n\nThis proposal was accepted, and the captain and Paganel prepared to\nstart immediately. They were to follow along the bank of the river till\nthey came to the place indicated by Ben Joyce, and keep out of sight\nof the convicts, who were probably lying in wait. These two courageous\nmen accordingly, well furnished with arms and provisions, set out, and\nsoon disappeared among the tall rushes of the river.\n\n[Illustration: The animal reared. Mulready seized his revolver and\nfired.]\n\nAll day the little party waited for them. At evening they had not yet\nreturned, and great fears were entertained. At last, about eleven\no'clock, Wilson announced their approach. They arrived, worn out with\nthe fatigues of a six-mile journey.\n\n\"The bridge? Is it there?\" asked Glenarvan, rushing to meet them.\n\n\"Yes, a bridge of rushes,\" said Captain Mangles. \"The convicts passed,\nit is true, but----\"\n\n\"But what?\" cried Glenarvan, who foresaw a new calamity.\n\n\"They burned it after their passage,\" replied Paganel.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIII.\n\nHELPLESS AND HOPELESS.\n\n\nIt was not the time to despair, but to act. If Kemple Pier bridge was\ndestroyed, they must cross the Snowy at all events, and reach Twofold\nBay before Ben Joyce's band. They lost no time, therefore, in vain\nwords; but the next day Captain Mangles and Glenarvan went to examine\nthe river, preparatory to a passage.\n\nThe tumultuous waters, swollen by the rains, had not subsided. They\nwhirled along with indescribable fury. It was certain death to brave\nthis torrent. Glenarvan, with folded arms and lowered head, stood\nmotionless.\n\n\"Do you wish me to try to swim to the opposite bank?\" asked Captain\nMangles.\n\n\"No, John,\" replied Glenarvan, seizing the bold young man by the hand;\n\"let us wait.\"\n\nThey both returned to the encampment. The day was passed in the most\nlively anxiety. Ten times did Glenarvan return to the river. He sought\nto contrive some bold plan of crossing it, but in va"}, {"chunk_id": 217, "text": "What do you mean, Tom?\" inquired Glenarvan.\n\n\"I mean,\" he replied, \"that when the quartermaster, Ayrton, learned,\nthe day after our departure, the Duncan's destination----\"\n\n\"Ayrton!\" cried Glenarvan. \"Is he on board?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord.\"\n\n\"Ayrton here!\" repeated Glenarvan, glancing at Captain Mangles.\n\n\"Wonderful indeed!\" said the young captain.\n\nIn an instant, with the swiftness of lightning, Ayrton's conduct, his\nlong-contrived treachery, Glenarvan's wound, the attack upon Mulready,\ntheir sufferings in the marshes of the Snowy, all the wretch's deeds,\nflashed upon the minds of the two men. And now, by a strange fatality,\nthe convict was in their power.\n\n\"Where is he?\" asked Glenarvan quickly.\n\n\"In a cabin in the forecastle,\" replied Tom Austin, \"closely guarded.\"\n\n\"Why this confinement?\"\n\n[Sidenote: AN UNOFFICIAL TRIBUNAL.]\n\n\"Because, when Ayrton saw that the yacht was sailing for New Zealand,\nhe flew into a passion; because he attempted to force me to change the\nship's course; because he threatened me; and, finally, because he urged\nmy men to a mutiny. I saw that he was a dangerous person, and was\ncompelled, therefore, to take precautions against him.\"\n\n\"And since that time?\"\n\n\"Since that time he has been in his cabin, without offering to come\nout.\"\n\n\"Good!\"\n\nAt this moment Glenarvan and Captain Mangles were summoned to the\nsaloon. Breakfast, which they so much needed, was ready. They took\nseats at the table, but did not speak of Ayrton.\n\nHowever, when the meal was ended, and the passengers had assembled on\ndeck, Glenarvan informed them of the quartermaster's presence on board.\nAt the same time he declared his intention of sending for him.\n\n\"Can I be released from attending this tribunal?\" asked Lady Helena.\n\"I confess to you, my dear Edward, that the sight of this unfortunate\nwould be very painful to me.\"\n\n\"It is only to confront him, Helena,\" replied Glenarvan. \"Remain,\nif you can. Ben Joyce should see himself face to face with all his\nintended victims.\"\n\nLady Helena yielded to this request, and Mary Grant and she took their\nplaces beside him, while around them stood the major, Paganel, Captain\nMangles, Robert, Wilson, Mulready, and Olbinett, all who had suffered\nso severely by the convict's treason. The crew of the yacht, who did\nnot yet understand the seriousness of these proceedings, maintained a\nprofound silence.\n\n\"Call Ayrton!\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVI.\n\nAYRTON'S OBSTINACY.\n\n\nAyrton soon made his appearance. He crossed the deck with a confident\nstep, and ascended the poop-stairs. His eyes had a sullen look, his\nteeth were set, and his fists clinched convulsively. His bearing\ndisplayed neither exultation nor humility. As soon as he was in Lord\nGlenarvan's presence, he folded his arms, and calmly and silently\nwaited to be questioned:\n\n\"Ayrton,\" said Glenarvan, \"here we all are, as you see, on board the\nDuncan, that you would have surrendered to Ben Joyce's accomplices.\"\n\nAt these words the lips of the quartermaster slightly trembled. A quick\nblush colored his hard features,--not the sign of remorse, but the\nshame of defeat. He was prisoner on this yacht that he had meant to\ncommand as master, and his fate was soon to be decided.\n\nHowever, he made no reply. Glenarvan waited patiently, but Ayrton still\npersisted in maintaining an obstinate silence.\n\n\"Speak, Ayrton; what have you to say?\" continued Glenarvan.\n\nThe convict hesitated, and the lines of his forehead were strongly\ncontracted. At last he said, in a calm voice:\n\n\"I have nothing to say, my lord. I was foolish enough to let myself be\ntaken. Do what you please.\"\n\n[Sidenote: A DUMB PRISONER.]\n\nHaving given his answer, the quartermaster turned his eyes toward\nthe coast that extended along the west, and affected a profound\nindifference for all that was passing around him.

It restores the\nblue color of litmus-paper reddened by an acid, and it turns syrup of\nviolets green. We have no litmus-paper, but, see, here they come with\nthe syrup of violets.”\n\nThe doctor was right; steps were heard in the passage.

Do you talk of a sacrifice?”\n\n“I do.”\n\n“Do you then suspect anyone?”\n\n“I suspect no one; death raps at your door—it enters—it goes, not\nblindfolded, but circumspectly, from room to room. Well, I follow its\ncourse, I track its passage; I adopt the wisdom of the ancients, and\nfeel my way, for my friendship for your family and my respect for you\nare as a twofold bandage over my eyes; well——”\n\n“Oh, speak, speak, doctor; I shall have courage.”\n\n“Well, sir, you have in your establishment, or in your family, perhaps,\none of the frightful monstrosities of which each century produces only\none. Locusta and Agrippina, living at the same time, were an exception,\nand proved the determination of Providence to effect the entire ruin of\nthe Roman empire, sullied by so many crimes.

He has but one\nfault, he is somewhat wilful; but really, on referring for the moment\nto what he said, do you truly believe that Mithridates used these\nprecautions, and that these precautions were efficacious?”\n\n“I think so, madame, because I myself have made use of them, that I\nmight not be poisoned at Naples, at Palermo, and at Smyrna—that is to\nsay, on three several occasions when, but for these precautions, I must\nhave lost my life.”\n\n“And your precautions were successful?”\n\n“Completely so.”\n\n“Yes, I remember now your mentioning to me at Perugia something of this\nsort.”\n\n“Indeed?” said the count with an air of surprise, remarkably well\ncounterfeited; “I really did not remember.”\n\n“I inquired of you if poisons acted equally, and with the same effect,\non men of the North as on men of the South; and you answered me that\nthe cold and sluggish habits of the North did not present the same\naptitude as the rich and energetic temperaments of the natives of the\nSouth.”\n\n“And that is the case,” observed Monte Cristo. “I have seen Russians\ndevour, without being visibly inconvenienced, vegetable substances\nwhich would infallibly have killed a Neapolitan or an Arab.”\n\n“And you really believe the result would be still more sure with us\nthan in the East, and in the midst of our fogs and rains a man would\nhabituate himself more easily than in a warm latitude to this\nprogressive absorption of poison?”\n\n“Certainly; it being at the same time perfectly understood that he\nshould have been duly fortified against the poison to which he had not\nbeen accustomed.”\n\n“Yes, I understand that; and how would you habituate yourself, for\ninstance, or rather, how did you habituate yourself to it?”\n\n“Oh, very easily. Suppose you knew beforehand the poison that would be\nmade use of against you; suppose the poison was, for instance,\nbrucine——”\n\n“Brucine is extracted from the false angostura8 is it not?” inquired\nMadame de Villefort.\n\n“Precisely, madame,” replied Monte Cristo; “but I perceive I have not\nmuch to teach you. Allow me to compliment you on your knowledge; such\nlearning is very rare among ladies.”\n\n“Oh, I am aware of that,” said Madame de Villefort; “but I have a\npassion for the occult sciences, which speak to the imagination like\npoetry, and are reducible to figures, like an algebraic equation; but\ngo on, I beg of you; what you say interests me to the greatest degree.”\n\n30069m\n\n\n\n“Well,” replied Monte Cristo “suppose, then, that this poison was\nbrucine, and you were to take a milligramme the first day, two\nmilligrammes the second day, and so on. Well, at the end of ten days\nyou would have taken a centigramme, at the end of twenty days,\nincreasing another milligramme, you would have taken three hundred\ncentigrammes; that is to say, a dose which you would support without\ninconvenience, and which would be very dangerous for any other person\nwho had not taken the same precautions as yourself. Well, then, at the\nend of a month, when drinking water from the same carafe, you would\nkill the person who drank with you, without your perceiving, otherwise\nthan from slight inconvenience, that there was any poisonous substance\nmingled with this water.”\n\n“Do you know any other counter-poisons?”\n\n“I do not.”\n\n“I have often read, and read again, the history of Mithridates,” said\nMadame de Villefort in a tone of reflection, “and had always considered\nit a fable.”\n\n“No, madame, contrary to most history, it is true; but what you tell\nme, madame, what you inquire of me, is not the result of a chance\nquery, for two years ago you asked me the same questions, and said\nthen, that for a very long time this history of Mithridates had\noccupied your mind.”\n\n“True, sir. The two favorite studies of my youth were botany and\nmineralogy, and subsequently, when I learned that the use of simples\nfrequently explained the whole history of a people, and the entire life\nof individuals in the East, as flowers betoken and symbolize a love\naffair, I have reg"}, {"chunk_id": 563, "text": "k could not find the right key. He reached the\ninstrument he had placed on the stand, touched a spring, and\nimmediately a pale light, just bright enough to render objects\ndistinct, was reflected on his hands and countenance.\n\n“By heavens,” exclaimed Monte Cristo, starting back, “it is——”\n\nAli raised his hatchet.\n\n“Don’t stir,” whispered Monte Cristo, “and put down your hatchet; we\nshall require no arms.”\n\n40154m\n\n\n\nThen he added some words in a low tone, for the exclamation which\nsurprise had drawn from the count, faint as it had been, had startled\nthe man who remained in the pose of the old knife-grinder.\n\nIt was an order the count had just given, for immediately Ali went\nnoiselessly, and returned, bearing a black dress and a three-cornered\nhat. Meanwhile Monte Cristo had rapidly taken off his greatcoat,\nwaistcoat, and shirt, and one might distinguish by the glimmering\nthrough the open panel that he wore a pliant tunic of steel mail, of\nwhich the last in France, where daggers are no longer dreaded, was worn\nby King Louis XVI., who feared the dagger at his breast, and whose head\nwas cleft with a hatchet. The tunic soon disappeared under a long\ncassock, as did his hair under a priest’s wig; the three-cornered hat\nover this effectually transformed the count into an abbé.\n\nThe man, hearing nothing more, stood erect, and while Monte Cristo was\ncompleting his disguise had advanced straight to the secretaire, whose\nlock was beginning to crack under his nightingale.\n\n“Try again,” whispered the count, who depended on the secret spring,\nwhich was unknown to the picklock, clever as he might be—“try again,\nyou have a few minutes’ work there.”\n\nAnd he advanced to the window. The man whom he had seen seated on a\nfence had got down, and was still pacing the street; but, strange as it\nappeared, he cared not for those who might pass from the avenue of the\nChamps-Élysées or by the Faubourg Saint-Honoré; his attention was\nengrossed with what was passing at the count’s, and his only aim\nappeared to be to discern every movement in the dressing-room.\n\nMonte Cristo suddenly struck his finger on his forehead and a smile\npassed over his lips; then drawing near to Ali, he whispered:\n\n“Remain here, concealed in the dark, and whatever noise you hear,\nwhatever passes, only come in or show yourself if I call you.”\n\nAli bowed in token of strict obedience. Monte Cristo then drew a\nlighted taper from a closet, and when the thief was deeply engaged with\nhis lock, silently opened the door, taking care that the light should\nshine directly on his face. The door opened so quietly that the thief\nheard no sound; but, to his astonishment, the room was suddenly\nilluminated. He turned.\n\n“Ah, good-evening, my dear M. Caderousse,” said Monte Cristo; “what are\nyou doing here, at such an hour?”\n\n40156m\n\n\n\n“The Abbé Busoni!” exclaimed Caderousse; and, not knowing how this\nstrange apparition could have entered when he had bolted the doors, he\nlet fall his bunch of keys, and remained motionless and stupefied. The\ncount placed himself between Caderousse and the window, thus cutting\noff from the thief his only chance of retreat.\n\n“The Abbé Busoni!” repeated Caderousse, fixing his haggard gaze on the\ncount.\n\n“Yes, undoubtedly, the Abbé Busoni himself,” replied Monte Cristo. “And\nI am very glad you recognize me, dear M. Caderousse; it proves you have\na good memory, for it must be about ten years since we last met.”\n\nThis calmness of Busoni, combined with his irony and boldness,\nstaggered Caderousse.\n\n“The abbé, the abbé!” murmured he, clenching his fists, and his teeth\nchattering.\n\n“So you would rob the Count of Monte Cristo?” continued the false abbé.\n\n“Reverend sir,” murmured Caderousse, seeking to regain the window,\nwhich the count pitilessly blocked—“reverend sir, I don’t know—believe\nme—I take my oath——”\n\n“A pane of glass out,” continued the count, “a dark lantern, a bunch of\nfalse keys, a secretaire half forced—it is tolerably evident——”\n\nCaderousse was choking; he looked "}, {"chunk_id": 657, "text": "f an unparalleled intrusion, and\nthat what you call protection is more like an insult.”\n\n“Valentine,” he answered, “during my long watch over you, all I have\nobserved has been what people visited you, what nourishment was\nprepared, and what beverage was served; then, when the latter appeared\ndangerous to me, I entered, as I have now done, and substituted, in the\nplace of the poison, a healthful draught; which, instead of producing\nthe death intended, caused life to circulate in your veins.”\n\n“Poison—death!” exclaimed Valentine, half believing herself under the\ninfluence of some feverish hallucination; “what are you saying, sir?”\n\n50071m\n\n\n\n“Hush, my child,” said Monte Cristo, again placing his finger upon her\nlips, “I did say poison and death. But drink some of this;” and the\ncount took a bottle from his pocket, containing a red liquid, of which\nhe poured a few drops into the glass. “Drink this, and then take\nnothing more tonight.”\n\nValentine stretched out her hand, but scarcely had she touched the\nglass when she drew back in fear. Monte Cristo took the glass, drank\nhalf its contents, and then presented it to Valentine, who smiled and\nswallowed the rest.\n\n“Oh, yes,” she exclaimed, “I recognize the flavor of my nocturnal\nbeverage which refreshed me so much, and seemed to ease my aching\nbrain. Thank you, sir, thank you!”\n\n“This is how you have lived during the last four nights, Valentine,”\nsaid the count. “But, oh, how I passed that time! Oh, the wretched\nhours I have endured—the torture to which I have submitted when I saw\nthe deadly poison poured into your glass, and how I trembled lest you\nshould drink it before I could find time to throw it away!”\n\n“Sir,” said Valentine, at the height of her terror, “you say you\nendured tortures when you saw the deadly poison poured into my glass;\nbut if you saw this, you must also have seen the person who poured it?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nValentine raised herself in bed, and drew over her chest, which\nappeared whiter than snow, the embroidered cambric, still moist with\nthe cold dews of delirium, to which were now added those of terror.\n“You saw the person?” repeated the young girl.\n\n“Yes,” repeated the count.\n\n“What you tell me is horrible, sir. You wish to make me believe\nsomething too dreadful. What?—attempt to murder me in my father’s\nhouse, in my room, on my bed of sickness? Oh, leave me, sir; you are\ntempting me—you make me doubt the goodness of Providence—it is\nimpossible, it cannot be!”\n\n“Are you the first that this hand has stricken? Have you not seen M. de\nSaint-Méran, Madame de Saint-Méran, Barrois, all fall? Would not M.\nNoirtier also have fallen a victim, had not the treatment he has been\npursuing for the last three years neutralized the effects of the\npoison?”\n\n“Oh, Heaven,” said Valentine; “is this the reason why grandpapa has\nmade me share all his beverages during the last month?”\n\n“And have they all tasted of a slightly bitter flavor, like that of\ndried orange-peel?”\n\n“Oh, yes, yes!”\n\n“Then that explains all,” said Monte Cristo. “Your grandfather knows,\nthen, that a poisoner lives here; perhaps he even suspects the person.\nHe has been fortifying you, his beloved child, against the fatal\neffects of the poison, which has failed because your system was already\nimpregnated with it. But even this would have availed little against a\nmore deadly medium of death employed four days ago, which is generally\nbut too fatal.”\n\n“But who, then, is this assassin, this murderer?”\n\n“Let me also ask you a question. Have you never seen anyone enter your\nroom at night?”\n\n“Oh, yes; I have frequently seen shadows pass close to me, approach,\nand disappear; but I took them for visions raised by my feverish\nimagination, and indeed when you entered I thought I was under the\ninfluence of delirium.”\n\n“Then you do not know who it is that attempts your life?”\n\n50073m\n\n\n\n“No,” said Valentine; “who could desire my death?”\n\n“You shall know it now, then,” said Monte Cristo, listening.\n\n“How do you mean?” said Valentine, lo"}, {"chunk_id": 493, "text": " proceed from poison, but I could\nalso specify the poison.’”\n\n“Can it be possible?”\n\n“The symptoms are marked, do you see?—sleep broken by nervous spasms,\nexcitation of the brain, torpor of the nerve centres. Madame de\nSaint-Méran succumbed to a powerful dose of brucine or of strychnine,\nwhich by some mistake, perhaps, has been given to her.”\n\nVillefort seized the doctor’s hand.\n\n“Oh, it is impossible,” said he, “I must be dreaming! It is frightful\nto hear such things from such a man as you! Tell me, I entreat you, my\ndear doctor, that you may be deceived.”\n\n“Doubtless I may, but——”\n\n“But?”\n\n30345m\n\n\n\n“But I do not think so.”\n\n“Have pity on me doctor! So many dreadful things have happened to me\nlately that I am on the verge of madness.”\n\n“Has anyone besides me seen Madame de Saint-Méran?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Has anything been sent for from a chemist’s that I have not examined?”\n\n“Nothing.”\n\n“Had Madame de Saint-Méran any enemies?”\n\n“Not to my knowledge.”\n\n“Would her death affect anyone’s interest?”\n\n“It could not indeed, my daughter is her only heiress—Valentine alone.\nOh, if such a thought could present itself, I would stab myself to\npunish my heart for having for one instant harbored it.”\n\n“Indeed, my dear friend,” said M. d’Avrigny, “I would not accuse\nanyone; I speak only of an accident, you understand,—of a mistake,—but\nwhether accident or mistake, the fact is there; it is on my conscience\nand compels me to speak aloud to you. Make inquiry.”\n\n“Of whom?—how?—of what?”\n\n“May not Barrois, the old servant, have made a mistake, and have given\nMadame de Saint-Méran a dose prepared for his master?”\n\n“For my father?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“But how could a dose prepared for M. Noirtier poison Madame de\nSaint-Méran?”\n\n“Nothing is more simple. You know poisons become remedies in certain\ndiseases, of which paralysis is one. For instance, having tried every\nother remedy to restore movement and speech to M. Noirtier, I resolved\nto try one last means, and for three months I have been giving him\nbrucine; so that in the last dose I ordered for him there were six\ngrains. This quantity, which is perfectly safe to administer to the\nparalyzed frame of M. Noirtier, which has become gradually accustomed\nto it, would be sufficient to kill another person.”\n\n“My dear doctor, there is no communication between M. Noirtier’s\napartment and that of Madame de Saint-Méran, and Barrois never entered\nmy mother-in-law’s room. In short, doctor although I know you to be the\nmost conscientious man in the world, and although I place the utmost\nreliance in you, I want, notwithstanding my conviction, to believe this\naxiom, _errare humanum est_.”\n\n“Is there one of my brethren in whom you have equal confidence with\nmyself?”\n\n“Why do you ask me that?—what do you wish?”\n\n“Send for him; I will tell him what I have seen, and we will consult\ntogether, and examine the body.”\n\n“And you will find traces of poison?”\n\n“No, I did not say of poison, but we can prove what was the state of\nthe body; we shall discover the cause of her sudden death, and we shall\nsay, ‘Dear Villefort, if this thing has been caused by negligence,\nwatch over your servants; if from hatred, watch your enemies.’”\n\n“What do you propose to me, d’Avrigny?” said Villefort in despair; “so\nsoon as another is admitted into our secret, an inquest will become\nnecessary; and an inquest in my house—impossible! Still,” continued the\nprocureur, looking at the doctor with uneasiness, “if you wish it—if\nyou demand it, why then it shall be done. But, doctor, you see me\nalready so grieved—how can I introduce into my house so much scandal,\nafter so much sorrow? My wife and my daughter would die of it!

He had only time to get his hat and\nthrow himself breathless into the closet when the procureur’s footstep\nwas heard in the passage.\n\nVillefort sprang into the room, ran to Valentine, and took her in his\narms.\n\n“A physician, a physician,—M. d’Avrigny!” cried Villefort; “or rather I\nwill go for him myself.”\n\nHe flew from the apartment, and Morrel at the same moment darted out at\nthe other door. He had been struck to the heart by a frightful\nrecollection—the conversation he had heard between the doctor and\nVillefort the night of Madame de Saint-Méran’s death, recurred to him;\nthese symptoms, to a less alarming extent, were the same which had\npreceded the death of Barrois. At the same time Monte Cristo’s voice\nseemed to resound in his ear with the words he had heard only two hours\nbefore, “Whatever you want, Morrel, come to me; I have great power.”\n\nMore rapidly than thought, he darted down the Rue Matignon, and thence\nto the Avenue des Champs-Élysées.\n\nMeanwhile M. de Villefort arrived in a hired cabriolet at M.\nd’Avrigny’s door. He rang so violently that the porter was alarmed.\nVillefort ran upstairs without saying a word. The porter knew him, and\nlet him pass, only calling to him:\n\n“In his study, Monsieur Procureur—in his study!” Villefort pushed, or\nrather forced, the door open.\n\n“Ah,” said the doctor, “is it you?”\n\n“Yes,” said Villefort, closing the door after him, “it is I, who am\ncome in my turn to ask you if we are quite alone. Doctor, my house is\naccursed!”\n\n“What?” said the latter with apparent coolness, but with deep emotion,\n“have you another invalid?”\n\n“Yes, doctor,” cried Villefort, clutching his hair, “yes!”\n\nD’Avrigny’s look implied, “I told you it would be so.” Then he slowly\nuttered these words, “Who is now dying in your house? What new victim\nis going to accuse you of weakness before God?”\n\nA mournful sob burst from Villefort’s heart; he approached the doctor,\nand seizing his arm,—“Valentine,” said he, “it is Valentine’s turn!”\n\n40284m\n\n\n\n“Your daughter!” cried d’Avrigny with grief and surprise.\n\n“You see you were deceived,” murmured the magistrate; “come and see\nher, and on her bed of agony entreat her pardon for having suspected\nher.”\n\n“Each time you have applied to me,” said the doctor, “it has been too\nlate; still I will go. But let us make haste, sir; with the enemies you\nhave to do with there is no time to be lost.”\n\n“Oh, this time, doctor, you shall not have to reproach me with\nweakness. This time I will know the assassin, and will pursue him.”\n\n“Let us try first to save the victim before we think of revenging her,”\nsaid d’Avrigny. “Come.”\n\nThe same cabriolet which had brought Villefort took them back at full\nspeed, and at this moment Morrel rapped at Monte Cristo’s door.\n\nThe count was in his study and was reading with an angry look something\nwhich Bertuccio had brought in haste. Hearing the name of Morrel, who\nhad left him only two hours before, the count raised his head, arose,\nand sprang to meet him.\n\n“What is the matter, Maximilian?” asked he; “you are pale, and the\nperspiration rolls from your forehead.” Morrel fell into a chair.\n\n“Yes,” said he, “I came quickly; I wanted to speak to you.”\n\n“Are all your family well?” asked the count, with an affectionate\nbenevolence, whose sincerity no one could for a moment doubt.\n\n“Thank you, count—thank you,” said the young man, evidently embarrassed\nhow to begin the conversation; “yes, everyone in my family is well.”\n\n“So much the better; yet you have something to tell me?” replied the\ncount with increased anxiety.\n\n“Yes,” said Morrel, “it is true; I have but now left a house where\ndeath has just entered, to run to you.”\n\n“Are you then come from M. de Morcerf’s?” asked Monte Cristo.\n\n“No,” said Morrel; “is someone dead in his house?"}, {"chunk_id": 315, "text": "rprise and terror; and without a word I suffered myself to be\nhandcuffed and tied to a horse’s tail, and thus they took me to Nîmes.\n\n“I had been tracked by a customs-officer, who had lost sight of me near\nthe tavern; feeling certain that I intended to pass the night there, he\nhad returned to summon his comrades, who just arrived in time to hear\nthe report of the pistol, and to take me in the midst of such\ncircumstantial proofs of my guilt as rendered all hopes of proving my\ninnocence utterly futile. One only chance was left me, that of\nbeseeching the magistrate before whom I was taken to cause every\ninquiry to be made for the Abbé Busoni, who had stopped at the inn of\nthe Pont du Gard on that morning.\n\n“If Caderousse had invented the story relative to the diamond, and\nthere existed no such person as the Abbé Busoni, then, indeed, I was\nlost past redemption, or, at least, my life hung upon the feeble chance\nof Caderousse himself being apprehended and confessing the whole truth.\n\n“Two months passed away in hopeless expectation on my part, while I\nmust do the magistrate the justice to say that he used every means to\nobtain information of the person I declared could exculpate me if he\nwould. Caderousse still evaded all pursuit, and I had resigned myself\nto what seemed my inevitable fate. My trial was to come on at the\napproaching assizes; when, on the 8th of September—that is to say,\nprecisely three months and five days after the events which had\nperilled my life—the Abbé Busoni, whom I never ventured to believe I\nshould see, presented himself at the prison doors, saying he understood\none of the prisoners wished to speak to him; he added, that having\nlearned at Marseilles the particulars of my imprisonment, he hastened\nto comply with my desire.\n\n“You may easily imagine with what eagerness I welcomed him, and how\nminutely I related the whole of what I had seen and heard. I felt some\ndegree of nervousness as I entered upon the history of the diamond,\nbut, to my inexpressible astonishment, he confirmed it in every\nparticular, and to my equal surprise, he seemed to place entire belief\nin all I said.\n\n“And then it was that, won by his mild charity, seeing that he was\nacquainted with all the habits and customs of my own country, and\nconsidering also that pardon for the only crime of which I was really\nguilty might come with a double power from lips so benevolent and kind,\nI besought him to receive my confession, under the seal of which I\nrecounted the Auteuil affair in all its details, as well as every other\ntransaction of my life. That which I had done by the impulse of my best\nfeelings produced the same effect as though it had been the result of\ncalculation. My voluntary confession of the assassination at Auteuil\nproved to him that I had not committed that of which I stood accused.\nWhen he quitted me, he bade me be of good courage, and to rely upon his\ndoing all in his power to convince my judges of my innocence.\n\n“I had speedy proofs that the excellent abbé was engaged in my behalf,\nfor the rigors of my imprisonment were alleviated by many trifling\nthough acceptable indulgences, and I was told that my trial was to be\npostponed to the assizes following those now being held.\n\n“In the interim it pleased Providence to cause the apprehension of\nCaderousse, who was discovered in some distant country, and brought\nback to France, where he made a full confession, refusing to make the\nfact of his wife’s having suggested and arranged the murder any excuse\nfor his own guilt. The wretched man was sentenced to the galleys for\nlife, and I was immediately set at liberty.”\n\n“And then it was, I presume,” said Monte Cristo “that you came to me as\nthe bearer of a letter from the Abbé Busoni?”\n\n“It was, your excellency; the benevolent abbé took an evident interest\nin all that concerned me.\n\n“‘Your mode of life as a smuggler,’ said he to me one day, ‘will be the\nruin of you; if you get out, don’t take it up again.’\n\n“‘But how,’ inquired I, ‘am I to maint"}, {"chunk_id": 98, "text": "tès\nprevented from being heard by covering his head with the blanket. The\nfit lasted two hours; then, more helpless than an infant, and colder\nand paler than marble, more crushed and broken than a reed trampled\nunder foot, he fell back, doubled up in one last convulsion, and became\nas rigid as a corpse.\n\nEdmond waited till life seemed extinct in the body of his friend, then,\ntaking up the knife, he with difficulty forced open the closely fixed\njaws, carefully administered the appointed number of drops, and\nanxiously awaited the result. An hour passed away and the old man gave\nno sign of returning animation. Dantès began to fear he had delayed too\nlong ere he administered the remedy, and, thrusting his hands into his\nhair, continued gazing on the lifeless features of his friend. At\nlength a slight color tinged the livid cheeks, consciousness returned\nto the dull, open eyeballs, a faint sigh issued from the lips, and the\nsufferer made a feeble effort to move.\n\n“He is saved! he is saved!” cried Dantès in a paroxysm of delight.\n\nThe sick man was not yet able to speak, but he pointed with evident\nanxiety towards the door. Dantès listened, and plainly distinguished\nthe approaching steps of the jailer. It was therefore near seven\no’clock; but Edmond’s anxiety had put all thoughts of time out of his\nhead.\n\nThe young man sprang to the entrance, darted through it, carefully\ndrawing the stone over the opening, and hurried to his cell. He had\nscarcely done so before the door opened, and the jailer saw the\nprisoner seated as usual on the side of his bed. Almost before the key\nhad turned in the lock, and before the departing steps of the jailer\nhad died away in the long corridor he had to traverse, Dantès, whose\nrestless anxiety concerning his friend left him no desire to touch the\nfood brought him, hurried back to the abbé’s chamber, and raising the\nstone by pressing his head against it, was soon beside the sick man’s\ncouch. Faria had now fully regained his consciousness, but he still lay\nhelpless and exhausted on his miserable bed.\n\n“I did not expect to see you again,” said he feebly, to Dantès.\n\n“And why not?” asked the young man. “Did you fancy yourself dying?”\n\n“No, I had no such idea; but, knowing that all was ready for flight, I\nthought you might have made your escape.”\n\nThe deep glow of indignation suffused the cheeks of Dantès.\n\n“Without you? Did you really think me capable of that?”\n\n“At least,” said the abbé, “I now see how wrong such an opinion would\nhave been. Alas, alas!

The abbé shook his head.\n\n“The last attack I had,” said he, “lasted but half an hour, and after\nit I was hungry, and got up without help; now I can move neither my\nright arm nor leg, and my head seems uncomfortable, which shows that\nthere has been a suffusion of blood on the brain. The third attack will\neither carry me off, or leave me paralyzed for life.”\n\n“No, no,” cried Dantès; “you are mistaken—you will not die! And your\nthird attack (if, indeed, you should have another) will find you at\nliberty. We shall save you another time, as we have done this, only\nwith a better chance of success, because we shall be able to command\nevery requisite assistance.”\n\n“My good Edmond,” answered the abbé, “be not deceived. The attack which\nhas just passed away, condemns me forever to the walls of a prison.\nNone can fly from a dungeon who cannot walk.”\n\n“Well, we will wait,—a week, a month, two months, if need be,—and\nmeanwhile your strength will return. Everything is in readiness for our\nflight, and we can select any time we choose. As soon as you feel able\nto swim we will go.”\n\n“I shall never swim again,” replied Faria. “This arm is paralyzed; not\nfor a time, but forever.

I feel cramps over my whole body.”\n\n“Do you find any dazzling sensation before the eyes?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Any noise in the ears?”\n\n“Frightful.”\n\n40112m\n\n\n\n“When did you first feel that?”\n\n“Just now.”\n\n“Suddenly?”\n\n“Yes, like a clap of thunder.”\n\n“Did you feel nothing of it yesterday or the day before?”\n\n“Nothing.”\n\n“No drowsiness?”\n\n“None.”\n\n“What have you eaten today?”\n\n“I have eaten nothing; I only drank a glass of my master’s\nlemonade—that’s all.” And Barrois turned towards Noirtier, who,\nimmovably fixed in his armchair, was contemplating this terrible scene\nwithout allowing a word or a movement to escape him.\n\n“Where is this lemonade?” asked the doctor eagerly.\n\n“Downstairs in the decanter.”\n\n“Whereabouts downstairs?”\n\n“In the kitchen.”\n\n“Shall I go and fetch it, doctor?” inquired Villefort.\n\n“No, stay here and try to make Barrois drink the rest of this glass of\nether and water. I will go myself and fetch the lemonade.”\n\nD’Avrigny bounded towards the door, flew down the back staircase, and\nalmost knocked down Madame de Villefort, in his haste, who was herself\ngoing down to the kitchen. She cried out, but d’Avrigny paid no\nattention to her; possessed with but one idea, he cleared the last four\nsteps with a bound, and rushed into the kitchen, where he saw the\ndecanter about three parts empty still standing on the waiter, where it\nhad been left. He darted upon it as an eagle would seize upon its prey.\nPanting with loss of breath, he returned to the room he had just left.\nMadame de Villefort was slowly ascending the steps which led to her\nroom.\n\n“Is this the decanter you spoke of?” asked d’Avrigny.\n\n“Yes, doctor.”\n\n“Is this the same lemonade of which you partook?”\n\n“I believe so.”\n\n“What did it taste like?”\n\n“It had a bitter taste.”\n\nThe doctor poured some drops of the lemonade into the palm of his hand,\nput his lips to it, and after having rinsed his mouth as a man does\nwhen he is tasting wine, he spat the liquor into the fireplace.\n\n“It is no doubt the same,” said he. “Did you drink some too, M.\nNoirtier?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“And did you also discover a bitter taste?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Oh, doctor,” cried Barrois, “the fit is coming on again. Oh, do\nsomething for me.” The doctor flew to his patient.\n\n“That emetic, Villefort—see if it is coming.”\n\nVillefort sprang into the passage, exclaiming, “The emetic! the\nemetic!—is it come yet?” No one answered. The most profound terror\nreigned throughout the house.\n\n“If I had anything by means of which I could inflate the lungs,” said\nd’Avrigny, looking around him, “perhaps I might prevent suffocation.\nBut there is nothing which would do!—nothing!”\n\n40114m\n\n\n\n“Oh, sir,” cried Barrois, “are you going to let me die without help?\nOh, I am dying! Oh, save me!”\n\n“A pen, a pen!” said the doctor. There was one lying on the table; he\nendeavored to introduce it into the mouth of the patient, who, in the\nmidst of his convulsions, was making vain attempts to vomit; but the\njaws were so clenched that the pen could not pass them. This second\nattack was much more violent than the first, and he had slipped from\nthe couch to the ground, where he was writhing in agony. The doctor\nleft him in this paroxysm, knowing that he could do nothing to\nalleviate it, and, going up to Noirtier, said abruptly:\n\n“How do you find yourself?—well?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Have you any weight on the chest; or does yo"}, {"chunk_id": 547, "text": "ed the magistrate, with an accent of horror and\nconsternation, “are you still harping on that terrible idea?”\n\n“Still, sir; and I shall always do so,” replied d’Avrigny, “for it has\nnever for one instant ceased to retain possession of my mind; and that\nyou may be quite sure I am not mistaken this time, listen well to what\nI am going to say, M. de Villefort.”\n\nThe magistrate trembled convulsively.\n\n“There is a poison which destroys life almost without leaving any\nperceptible traces. I know it well; I have studied it in all its forms\nand in the effects which it produces. I recognized the presence of this\npoison in the case of poor Barrois as well as in that of Madame de\nSaint-Méran. There is a way of detecting its presence. It restores the\nblue color of litmus-paper reddened by an acid, and it turns syrup of\nviolets green. We have no litmus-paper, but, see, here they come with\nthe syrup of violets.”\n\nThe doctor was right; steps were heard in the passage. M. d’Avrigny\nopened the door, and took from the hands of the chambermaid a cup which\ncontained two or three spoonfuls of the syrup, he then carefully closed\nthe door.\n\n“Look,” said he to the procureur, whose heart beat so loudly that it\nmight almost be heard, “here is in this cup some syrup of violets, and\nthis decanter contains the remainder of the lemonade of which M.\nNoirtier and Barrois partook. If the lemonade be pure and inoffensive,\nthe syrup will retain its color; if, on the contrary, the lemonade be\ndrugged with poison, the syrup will become green. Look closely!”\n\nThe doctor then slowly poured some drops of the lemonade from the\ndecanter into the cup, and in an instant a light cloudy sediment began\nto form at the bottom of the cup; this sediment first took a blue\nshade, then from the color of sapphire it passed to that of opal, and\nfrom opal to emerald. Arrived at this last hue, it changed no more. The\nresult of the experiment left no doubt whatever on the mind.\n\n“The unfortunate Barrois has been poisoned,” said d’Avrigny, “and I\nwill maintain this assertion before God and man.”\n\nVillefort said nothing, but he clasped his hands, opened his haggard\neyes, and, overcome with his emotion, sank into a chair.\n\n\n\n Chapter 80. The Accusation\n\nM. d’Avrigny soon restored the magistrate to consciousness, who had\nlooked like a second corpse in that chamber of death.\n\n“Oh, death is in my house!” cried Villefort.\n\n“Say, rather, crime!” replied the doctor.\n\n“M. d’Avrigny,” cried Villefort, “I cannot tell you all I feel at this\nmoment,—terror, grief, madness.”\n\n“Yes,” said M. d’Avrigny, with an imposing calmness, “but I think it is\nnow time to act. I think it is time to stop this torrent of mortality.\nI can no longer bear to be in possession of these secrets without the\nhope of seeing the victims and society generally revenged.”\n\nVillefort cast a gloomy look around him. “In my house,” murmured he,\n“in my house!”\n\n“Come, magistrate,” said M. d’Avrigny, “show yourself a man; as an\ninterpreter of the law, do honor to your profession by sacrificing your\nselfish interests to it.”\n\n“You make me shudder, doctor. Do you talk of a sacrifice?”\n\n“I do.”\n\n“Do you then suspect anyone?”\n\n“I suspect no one; death raps at your door—it enters—it goes, not\nblindfolded, but circumspectly, from room to room.

Everything was\nexplained. But what would the geographer say, when he learned the name\nand destination of the vessel on which he had taken passage?\n\n\"So, Monsieur Paganel,\" said Glenarvan, \"you have chosen Calcutta as\nyour centre of action?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord.

A gold medal is promised to that\ntraveler who shall succeed in supplying this much-needed information on\nIndian geography.\"\n\nPaganel was grandiloquent. He spoke with a lofty animation, and was\ncarried away in the rapid flight of imagination. It would have been\nas impossible to check him as to stay the Rhine at the Falls of\nSchaffhausen.\n\n\"Monsieur Jacques Paganel,\" said Lord Glenarvan, after a moment\nof silence, \"that is certainly a fine voyage, and one for which\nscience would be very grateful; but I will not further prolong your\nignorance. For the present, you must give up the pleasure of seeing\nIndia.\"\n\n\n\"Give it up! And why?\"\n\n\"Because you are turning your back upon the Indian peninsula.\"\n\n\"How? Captain Burton----\"\n\n\"I am not Captain Burton,\" replied John Mangles.\n\n\"But the Scotia?\"\n\n\"This vessel is not the Scotia.\"\n\nPaganel's amazement cannot be depicted. He looked first at Lord\nGlenarvan, always serious; then at Lady Helena and Miss Grant, whose\nfeatures expressed a sympathetic disappointment; and finally at Captain\nMangles, who was smiling, and the imperturbable major. Then, raising\nhis shoulders and drawing down his glasses from his forehead to his\neyes, he exclaimed,--\n\n\"What a joke!\"\n\nBut at that his eyes fell upon the steering wheel, on which were\ninscribed these two words, thus:\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"The Duncan! the Duncan!\" he cried in a tone of real despair; and,\nleaping down the companion-way, he rushed to his cabin.\n\nWhen the unfortunate geographer had disappeared, no one on board,\nexcept the major, could retain gravity, and the laugh was communicated\neven to the sailors. To mistake the railroad was not so bad; to take\nthe train to Dumbarton, instead of Edinburgh, would do. But to mistake\nthe vessel, and be sailing to Chili, when he wished to go to India, was\nthe height of absent-mindedness.\n\n[Sidenote: ABSENT-MINDEDNESS.]\n\n\"On the whole, I am not astonished at this on the part of Jacques\nPaganel,\" said Glenarvan; \"he is noted for such blunders.

Lady Helena was the first to\nresume the conversation.\n\n\"What an idea!\" she exclaimed.\n\n\"What a _good_ idea!\" added the geographer, simply.\n\n\"Your advice then?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"My advice is to find the thirty-seventh parallel, just where it meets\nthe American coast, and follow it, without deviating half a degree, to\nthe point where it strikes the Atlantic. Perhaps we shall find on its\ncourse the survivors of the Britannia.\"\n\n\"A feeble chance,\" replied the major.\n\n\"However feeble it may be,\" continued Paganel, \"we ought not to neglect\nit. If I am right that this bottle reached the sea by following the\ncurrent of a river, we cannot fail to come upon the traces of the\nprisoners. Look, my friends, look at the map of this country, and I\nwill convince you beyond a doubt.\"\n\n[Sidenote: NIL DESPERANDUM!]\n\nSo saying, Paganel spread out before them upon the table a large map of\nChili and the Argentine Provinces. \"Look,\" said he, \"and follow me in\nthis passage across the American continent. Let us pass over the narrow\nstrip of Chili and the Cordilleras of the Andes, and descend into the\nmidst of the Pampas. Are rivers, streams, water-courses, wanting in\nthese regions? No. Here are the Rio Negro, the Rio Colorado, and their\naffluents, cut by the thirty-seventh parallel, all of which might have\nserved to transport the document. There, perhaps, in the midst of a\ntribe, in the hands of settled Indians, on the shores of these unknown\nrivers, in the gorges of the sierras, those whom I have the right to\ncall our friends are awaiting an interposition of Providence. Ought\nwe, then, to disappoint their hopes? Do you not think we should follow\nacross these countries an unswerving course? And if, contrary to all\nexpectation, I am still mistaken, is it not our duty to trace this\nparallel to the very end, and, if necessary, make upon it the tour of\nthe world?\"\n\nThese words, spoken with a noble enthusiasm, excited a deep emotion\namong Paganel's hearers. All rose to shake hands with him.\n\n\"Yes, my father is there!\" cried Robert Grant, devouring the map with\nhis eyes.\n\n\"And wherever he is,\" replied Glenarvan, \"we shall find him, my child.\nNothing is more consistent than our friend Paganel's interpretation,\nand we must follow without hesitation the course he has indicated.\nEither Captain Grant is in the hands of countless Indians, or is\nprisoner in a feeble tribe. In the latter case, we will rescue him. In\nthe former, after ascertaining his situation, we will join the Duncan\non the eastern coast, sail to Buenos Ayres, and with a detachment,\norganized by the major, can overcome all the Indians of the Argentine\nPlains.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, your lordship,\" answered Captain Mangles; \"and I will add\nthat this passage of the continent will be without peril.\"\n\n\"Without peril, or fatigue,\" continued Paganel. \"How many have already\naccomplished it who had scarcely our means for success, and whose\ncourage was not sustained by the grandeur of the undertaking!\"\n\n\"Sir, sir,\" exclaimed Mary Grant, in a voice broken with emotion, \"how\ncan I thank a devotion that exposes you to so many dangers?\"\n\n\"Dangers!\" cried Paganel. \"Who uttered the word _danger_?\"\n\n\"Not I!\" replied Robert Grant, with flashing eye and determined look.\n\n\"Danger!\" repeated Paganel; \"does such a thing exist?

This discovery clearly justified the\ndoubts of the officer. The natives had no hand in the crime.\n\n\"Those who struck the blow,\" said he, \"are persons already familiar\nwith the use of these little instruments.\"\n\nAs he spoke he displayed a pair of \"darbies,\" a kind of manacles\nconsisting of a double ring of iron, furnished with a padlock.\n\n\"Before long,\" added he, \"I shall have the pleasure of presenting them\nwith these bracelets as a new year's gift.\"\n\n\"Then you suspect----?\"\n\n\"People who have 'traveled free on Her Majesty's vessels.'\"\n\n\"What! convicts?\" cried Paganel, who recognized the phrase employed in\nthe Australian colonies.\n\n\"I thought,\" observed Glenarvan, \"that those who have been transported\nhad no right to stay in the province of Victoria.\"\n\n\"Ah, well,\" replied the officer, \"if they have not the right, they take\nit!

At this\nmoment the cart arrived at the railroad crossing. Glenarvan, wishing\nto spare the ladies the spectacle at Camden Bridge, took leave of the\nsurveyor-general, and made a sign to his companions to follow him.\n\n\"There is no occasion,\" said he, \"for us to interrupt our journey.\"\n\nOn reaching the cart, Glenarvan simply told Lady Helena that a railroad\naccident had taken place, without mentioning the part that the convicts\nhad played in the catastrophe. He reserved this matter that he might\nquestion Ayrton in private. The little party then crossed the track,\nnot far above the bridge, and resumed their route towards the east.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\n\nFRESH FACES.\n\n\nThey had not proceeded far before they reached a native cemetery,\npleasantly situated and with abundance of shady trees. Here for a\ntime they halted, and, whilst Robert and Paganel were exploring, Lord\nand Lady Glenarvan almost stumbled over a queer object. It was human,\nindigenous, and sleeping; but at first this was all that they could\ndecide, until, as the eyes opened and the sleeper roused to active\nlife, they saw before them a boy of eight years, with a notice pinned\nto the back of his jacket which read as follows: \"TOLINÉ*, to be\nconducted to Echuca, care of Jeff Smith, Railway Porter. Prepaid.\"\n\n[Illustration: A boy of eight years, with a notice pinned to the back\nof his jacket which read as follows: \"Toliné, to be conducted to\nEchuca, care of Jeff Smith, Railway Porter. Prepaid.\"]\n\nHere, it would seem, was another waif that Providence had cast in their\npath. They questioned him, and his answers were pertinent and clear. He\nhad been educated in the Wesleyan Methodist day-school at Melbourne,\nand was now going for a time to visit his parents, who were living\nwith the rest of their tribe in Lachlan. He had been in the train to\nwhich the accident had happened, and had, with childlike confidence,\ntroubled less about his fate than did those of older years. Going to a\nlittle distance, and laying himself on the grass, he had soon fallen\ninto the slumber from which our travelers had aroused him.\n\n[Illustration: Paganel and the others had now gathered round, and\nToliné had to answer many a question. He came out of his examination\nvery creditably.]\n\nPaganel and the others had now gathered round, and Toliné had to answer\nmany a question. He came out of his examination very creditably; the\nreverence with which he spoke of the Creator and of the Bible produced\na very favorable impression on the Scottish heads of the expedition,\nwhilst the fact that he had taken \"the fir"}, {"chunk_id": 129, "text": "onda\nfor its wealth and attractions. Besides all this, here was the centre\nof the varied agencies by which the reports were brought in from the\ncompanies established for mining purposes, and also from each isolated\nworker, of the space purchased, the number of feet or yards dug, the\nore extracted, the comparative richness or poverty of the soil here,\nthere, and elsewhere, which in their summarized and aggregate form have\ngreatly helped to a correct knowledge of the comparative and absolute\ngold-bearing value of various spots. Then, in addition to the usual\noperations of a banking establishment, it was here that the ore was\nstored, from hence that it was sent, under government escort and with\ngovernment guarantee, subject to a fixed, though moderate, charge,\nso that the transport to Melbourne, which at first was a dangerous\nand expensive \"middle passage,\" was now as easily and inexpensively\naccomplished as is the transmission of freight from London to Paris.\n\n[Illustration: In the streets, in connection with the strange\nsign-boards and announcements, the novel erections and purposes to\nwhich some of them were adapted, Paganel had a history and commentary\nfor every one.]\n\nOver the whole of this establishment they were conducted by the most\ncourteous and obliging of officials, and the services thus rendered\ncharmed the Frenchman, who was none the less loquacious, and was in\ntruth able even to enlighten his guides.\n\n[Illustration: Here was the mineralogical museum, in which might be\nseen specimens illustrative of all the various ways in which the gold\nhas been found.]\n\n[Sidenote: PLEASING PROGRESS.]\n\nBut his joy culminated when, after some time spent in the hotel, the\nparty left the town, and passed through the \"diggings,\" properly so\ncalled. It was difficult to persuade Paganel and Robert--who kept\ntogether--to come on, in order that they might not leave Ayrton and\nMulready too long in suspense. Now the Frenchman would see just the key\nthat he needed to understand a point not before clear to him; anon you\nmight see him as in the illustration, when he had picked up a pebble\nand was sure that it was in itself so interesting as a mineralogical\nspecimen that he must treasure it up for the Bank of France, so that\nhis own land might have at least one part of Australia. All this was\ndone with such a mingling of childish good-nature and scientific and\nnational pride that it was useless to do anything but laugh, and an\nirrepressible smile came over even the major's features. At length,\nhowever, by drawing him into a lecture, they succeeded in persuading\nhim to follow them; and, as they left the diggings, he told them the\nhistory of the prophecies, the discovery, and the spread of knowledge\nas to the rich auriferous deposits of this part of Australia. He\ncould give them facts and incidents and dates as to the ingress into\nMelbourne, and the exodus therefrom to the diggings, in the year 1852;\nhe told them how the energy and the love of order which characterize\nthe English-speaking peoples had reduced to system, method,\nsubordination, the chaotic surgings and restlessness which marked the\nfirst weeks and months of this new era; and he detailed, as though\nhe had studied the subject to the entire neglect of other matters,\nthe working of the system,--how the land was registered, what was the\nsum paid in the aggregate, how the taxes were collected, wherein the\nsystem had been found faulty. All this occupied much time, and, before\nhe had finished, the cart was in sight, in which Lady Helena and Miss\nGrant reseated themselves, and for the remainder of the day and the\nsucceeding night their progress was in the accustomed order.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\n\nA WARNING.\n\n\nAt sunrise the travelers left the gold regions and crossed the\nfrontiers of the county of Talbot.

They did not\nstop, therefore, and soon the feet of the horses struck the grassy\nsward of the first mountain slopes.

Glenarvan, accordingly, put the horses into the stable of a\n\"fonda;\" and Paganel, the major, Robert, and he, under the guidance of\nThalcave, proceeded towards Fort Independence.\n\nAfter ascending the ridges of the mountains for a short time, they\narrived at the postern, rather carelessly guarded by a native sentinel.\nThey passed without difficulty, and inferred either great negligence or\nextreme security. A few soldiers were exercising on the parade-ground\nof the fort, the oldest of whom was not more than twenty and the\nyoungest scarcely ten. In fact, they were a dozen young children and\nboys who were drilling very nicely. Their uniform consisted of a\nstriped shirt confined at the waist by a leathern girdle. The mildness\nof the climate justified this light costume. Each of these young\nsoldiers carried a gun and a sword, which were too long and heavy for\nthe little fellows. All had a certain family resemblance, and the\ncorporal who commanded resembled them too: they were twelve brothers,\nwho were parading under the orders of the thirteenth.\n\n[Sidenote: AN ARGENTINE COMMANDANT.]\n\nPaganel was not astonished. He remembered his Argentine statistics, and\nknew that in this country the average number of children in a family\nexceeds nine. But what surprised him exceedingly was to see these\nlittle soldiers practicing the French tactics, and to hear the orders\nof the corporal given in his own native language.\n\n\"This is singular,\" said he.\n\nBut Glenarvan had not come to see boys drill, still less to occupy\nhimself with their nationality or relationship. He did not, therefore,\ngive Paganel time to express further astonishment, but besought him\nto ask for the commander of the fortress. Paganel did so, and one of\nthe soldiers proceeded towards a small building which served as the\nbarracks.\n\nA few moments after, the commander appeared in person. He was a man\nof fifty, robust, with a military air, thick whiskers, prominent\ncheek-bones, gray hair, and commanding look, so far as one could judge\nthrough the clouds of smoke that issued from his short pipe.\n\nThalcave, addressing him, introduced Lord Glenarvan and his companions.\nWhile he spoke, the commander kept scrutinizing Paganel with quite\nembarrassing persistence. The geographer did not know what the trooper\nmeant, and was about to ask him, when the latter unceremoniously seized\nhis hand, and said, in a joyous tone, in his own language,--\n\n\"A Frenchman?\"\n\n\"Yes, a Frenchman,\" replied Paganel.\n\n\"Ah, I am delighted! Welcome, welcome! I am almost a Frenchman,\"\ncried the commander, shaking the geographer's arm with rather painful\nviolence.\n\n\"One of your friends?\" asked the major of Paganel.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied he, with national pride; \"we have friends in all parts\nof the world!\"\n\n[Illustration: \"Ah, I am delighted! Welcome, welcome! I am almost a\nFrenchman,\" cried the commander, shaking the geographer's arm with\nrather painful violence.]\n\n[Sidenote: RAISING A REGIMENT.]\n\nHe then entered into conversation"}, {"chunk_id": 87, "text": "s, Monsieur Paganel,\" cried Robert.\n\n\"And what will your story prove?\" asked the major.\n\n\"What all stories prove, my brave companion.\"\n\n\"Not much, then,\" replied MacNabb. \"But go on, Scheherezade, and tell\none of those stories that you relate so well.\"\n\n\"There was once upon a time,\" said Paganel, \"a son of the great\nHaroun-al-Raschid who was not happy. He accordingly consulted an old\ndervish, who told him that happiness was a very difficult thing to\nfind in this world. 'However,' added he, 'I know an infallible way\nto procure you happiness.' 'What is it?' inquired the young prince.\n'It is,' replied the dervish, 'to put on the shirt of a happy man.'\nThereupon the prince embraced the old man, and set out in search of his\ntalisman. He visited all the capitals of the earth; he tried the shirts\nof kings, emperors, princes, and nobles; but it was a useless task, he\nwas no happier. Then he put on the shirts of artists, warriors, and\nmerchants, but with no more success. He had thus traveled far, without\nfinding happiness. At last, desperate from having tried so many shirts,\nhe was returning very sadly one beautiful day to the palace of his\nfather, when he spied in the field an honest laborer, who was joyously\nsinging as he ploughed. 'Here is, at all events, a man who possesses\nhappiness,' said he to himself, 'or happiness does not exist on earth.'\nHe approached him. 'Good man,' said he, 'are you happy?' 'Yes,' replied\nthe other. 'You wish for nothing?' 'No.' 'You would not change your lot\nfor that of a king?' 'Never!' 'Well, sell me your shirt!' 'My shirt! I\nhave none!'\"\n\n[Illustration: They were agreed on this point, that it was necessary to\nhave courage for every fortune, and be contented with a tree when one\nhas neither palace nor cottage.]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV.\n\nBETWEEN FIRE AND WATER.\n\n\nJacques Paganel's story had a very great success. He was greatly\napplauded, but each retained his own opinion, and the geographer\nobtained the result common to most discussions,--of convincing nobody.\nHowever, they were agreed on this point, that it was necessary to have\ncourage for every fortune, and be contented with a tree when one has\nneither palace nor cottage.\n\nDuring the course of this confabulation evening had come on. Only a\ngood sleep could thoroughly refresh, after this eventful day. The\ninmates of the tree felt themselves not only fatigued by the sudden\nchanges of the inundation, but especially overcome by the heat, which\nhad been excessive. Their feathered companions had already set the\nexample; the hilgueros, those nightingales of the Pampas, had ceased\ntheir melodious warblings, and all the birds had disappeared in the\nrecesses of the foliage. The best plan was to imitate them.\n\nBut before \"retiring to their nest,\" as Paganel said, Glenarvan,\nRobert, and he climbed to the observatory, to examine for the last\ntime the watery expanse. It was about nine o'clock. The sun had just\nset in the sparkling mists of the horizon, and all the western part\nof the firmament was bathed in a warm vapor. The constellations,\nusually so dazzling, seemed veiled in a soft haze. Still they could\nbe distinguished, and Paganel pointed out to Robert, for Glenarvan's\nbenefit, that zone where the stars are most brilliant.\n\n[Sidenote: PHILOSOPHY AND PONCHOS.]\n\nWhile the geographer was discoursing thus, the whole eastern horizon\nassumed a stormy aspect. A dense and dark band, clearly defined,\ngradually rose, dimming the light of the stars. This cloud of\nthreatening appearance soon invaded almost the entire vault of the sky.\nIts motive power must have been inherent in itself, for there was not\na breath of wind. Not a leaf stirred on the tree, not a ripple curled\nthe surface of the waters. Even the air seemed to fail, as if some\nhuge pneumatic machine had rarefied it. A strong electric current was\nperceptible in the atmosphere, and every creature felt it course along\nthe nerves. Glenarvan, Paganel, and Robert were sensibly affected by\nthese electric currents.\n\n\"We shal"}, {"chunk_id": 71, "text": "lighted! Welcome, welcome! I am almost a Frenchman,\"\ncried the commander, shaking the geographer's arm with rather painful\nviolence.\n\n\"One of your friends?\" asked the major of Paganel.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied he, with national pride; \"we have friends in all parts\nof the world!\"\n\n[Illustration: \"Ah, I am delighted! Welcome, welcome! I am almost a\nFrenchman,\" cried the commander, shaking the geographer's arm with\nrather painful violence.]\n\n[Sidenote: RAISING A REGIMENT.]\n\nHe then entered into conversation with the commander. Glenarvan would\ngladly have put in a word in regard to his affairs, but the soldier\nwas telling his story, and was not in the mood to be interrupted.\nThis honest man had left France a long time before; and the native\nlanguage was no longer perfectly familiar to him: he had forgotten,\nif not words, at least the manner of combining them. As his visitors\nsoon learned, he had been a sergeant in the French army. Since the\nfoundation of the fort he had not left it, and commanded it by\nappointment from the Argentine government. He was by parentage a\nBasque, and his name was Manuel Ipharaguerre. A year after his arrival\nin the country, Sergeant Manuel was naturalized, joined the Argentine\narmy, and married an honest Indian woman, who had twins,--boys, to be\nsure, for the sergeant's worthy consort would never present him with\ndaughters. Manuel did not think of any other calling than that of the\nsoldier, and hoped, in time, with the help of God, to offer to the\nrepublic a whole battalion of young soldiers.\n\n\"You have seen them?\" said he. \"Charming fellows! Good soldiers! José!\nJuan! Miguel! Pepe! Pepe is only seven years old, and is already biting\nhis cartridge!\"\n\nPepe, hearing himself complimented, joined his two little feet, and\npresented arms with perfect precision.\n\n\"He will do!\" added the sergeant. \"He will be a major--or\nbrigadier-general one day!\"\n\nThis story lasted a quarter of an hour, to Thalcave's great\nastonishment. The Indian could not understand how so many words could\ncome from a single throat. No one interrupted the commander; and even\na French sergeant had to conclude at last, though not without forcing\nhis guests to accompany him to his dwelling. Here they were introduced\nto Madame Ipharaguerre, who appeared to be \"a good-looking person,\" if\nthis expression may be employed in regard to an Indian.\n\nWhen he had exhausted himself, the sergeant asked his guests to what he\nowed the honor of their visit. And now it was their turn to explain.\n\nPaganel, opening the conversation in French, told him of their journey\nacross the Pampas, and ended by asking why the Indians had abandoned\nthe country.\n\n\"War!\" replied the sergeant.\n\n\"War?\"\n\n\"Yes, civil war.\"\n\n\"Civil war?\" rejoined Paganel.\n\n\"Yes, war between Paraguay and Buenos Ayres,\" answered the sergeant.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Why, all the Indians of the north are in the rear of General Flores,\nand those of the plains are plundering.\"\n\n\"But the caziques?\"\n\n\"The caziques with them.\"\n\nThis answer was reported to Thalcave, who shook his head. Indeed,\nhe either did not know, or had forgotten, that a civil war, which\nwas afterwards to involve Brazil, was decimating two-thirds of the\nrepublic. The Indians had everything to gain in these internal\nstruggles, and could not neglect such fine opportunities for plunder.\nThe sergeant, therefore, was not mistaken in attributing this desertion\nof the Pampas to the civil war that was being waged in the northern\npart of the Argentine Provinces.\n\nBut this event disconcerted Glenarvan's hopes. If Captain Grant was\na prisoner of the caziques, he must have been carried by them to the\nnorthern frontiers. Yet how and where to find him? Must they attempt\na perilous and almost useless search to the northern limits of the\nPampas? It was a serious matter, which was to be earnestly considered.\n\nHowever, one important question was still to be asked of the sergeant,\nand the major thought of this, while his companions were looking at\neach other in silence.\n\n\"Hav"}, {"chunk_id": 235, "text": "ge of\nLord Glenarvan.\n\nBut was Jacques Paganel to die a bachelor? Certainly not; for, after\nhis heroic exploits, the worthy geographer could not escape celebrity.\nHis eccentricities (and his abilities) made him much talked of in\nScotland. People seemed as though they could not show him enough\nattention.\n\nJust at this time an amiable lady of thirty, none other than the\nmajor's cousin, a little eccentric herself, but still agreeable and\ncharming, fell in love with the geographer's peculiarities. Paganel was\nfar from being insensible to Miss Arabella's attractions, yet did not\ndare to declare his sentiments. The major accordingly undertook the\npart of Cupid's messenger between these two congenial hearts, and even\ntold Paganel that marriage was \"the last blunder\" that he could commit.\nBut the geographer was very much embarrassed, and, strangely enough,\ncould not summon courage to speak for himself.\n\n[Illustration: Early in the afternoon the travelers reached Malcolm\nCastle, amidst the hurrahs of their tenantry and friends.]\n\n\"Does not Miss Arabella please you?\" MacNabb would say to him.\n\n\"Oh, major, she is charming!\" cried Paganel,--\"a thousand times too\ncharming for me; and, if I must tell you, would please me better if she\nwere less so. I should like to find a defect.\"\n\n\"Be easy,\" answered the major; \"she has more than one. The most perfect\nwoman always has her share. Well, then, Paganel, are you decided?\"\n\n\"I do not dare.\"\n\n\"But, my learned friend, why do you hesitate?\"\n\n\"I am unworthy of her!\" was the geographer's invariable reply.\n\nAt last, one day, driven desperate by the irrepressible major, Paganel\nconfessed to him, under the pledge of secrecy, a peculiarity that would\nfacilitate his identification, if the police should ever be on his\ntrack!\n\n\"Bah!\" exclaimed the major.\n\n\"It is as I tell you,\" persisted Paganel.\n\n\"What matter, my worthy friend?\"\n\n\"Is that your opinion?\"\n\n\"On the contrary, you are only more remarkable. This adds to your\npersonal advantages. It makes you the inimitable individual of whom\nArabella has dreamed.\"\n\nAnd the major, preserving an imperturbable gravity, left Paganel a prey\nto the most acute anxiety.\n\nA short interview took place between MacNabb and the lady, and fifteen\nweeks after a marriage was celebrated with great pomp in the chapel of\nMalcolm Castle.\n\n[Illustration: Fifteen weeks after a marriage was celebrated with great\npomp in the chapel of Malcolm Castle.]\n\nThe geographer's secret would doubtless have remained forever\nburied in the abysses of the unknown if the major had not told it to\nGlenarvan, who did not conceal it from Lady Helena, who communicated\nit to Mrs. Mangles. In short, it reached the ear of Mrs. Olbinett, and\nspread.\n\nJacques Paganel, during his three days' captivity among the Maoris, had\nbeen tattooed from head to foot, and bore on his breast the picture of\nan heraldic kiwi with outstretched wings, in the act of biting at his\nheart.\n\nThis was the only adventure of his great voyage for which Paganel\ncould never be consoled or pardon the New Zealanders. In spite of the\nrepresentations of his friends, he dared not go back to France, for\nfear of exposing the whole Geographical Society in his person to the\njests and railleries of the caricaturists.\n\nThe return of Captain Grant to Scotland was welcomed as a cause for\nnational rejoicing, and he became the popular man of old Caledonia. His\nson Robert has become a sailor like himself, and, under the patronage\nof Lord Glenarvan, has undertaken the plan of founding a Scottish\ncolony on the shores washed by the Pacific Ocean.\n\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK 46597 ***\n"}, {"chunk_id": 96, "text": "irst embraces, all were informed of the principal incidents\nof the journey; and, first of all, Glenarvan made known the new\ninterpretation of the document, due to the sagacity of Jacques Paganel.\nHe also praised Robert, of whom his sister had a right to be proud.\nHis courage, his devotion, and the dangers that he had overcome, were\nconspicuously set forth by his noble friend, so that the boy would not\nhave known where to hide himself, if his sister's arms had not afforded\nhim a sure refuge.\n\n[Illustration: Lady Helena and Mary Grant, while the boat was\napproaching the ship, had experienced all the anguish of suspense.

Lady Helena regretted that\nshe could not have shaken hands with the brave Indian. MacNabb, after\nthe first outbursts of enthusiasm, repaired to his cabin to shave\nhimself. As for Paganel, he flitted hither and thither, like a bee,\nextracting the honey of compliments and smiles. He wished to embrace\nall on board the Duncan, and, beginning with Lady Helena and Mary\nGrant, ended with Mr. Olbinett, the steward, who could not better\nrecognize such politeness than by announcing breakfast.\n\n\"Breakfast!\" cried Paganel.\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Paganel,\" replied Olbinett.\n\n\"A real breakfast, on a real table, with table-cloth and napkins?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"And shall we not eat hard eggs, or ostrich steaks?\"\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Paganel!\" replied the worthy steward, greatly embarrassed.\n\n\"I did not mean to offend you, my friend,\" said the geographer; \"but\nfor a month our food has been of that sort, and we have dined, not at\na table, but stretched on the ground, except when we were astride of\nthe trees. This breakfast that you have just announced seemed to me,\ntherefore, like a dream, a fiction, a chimera.\"\n\n\"Well, we will test its reality, Monsieur Paganel,\" replied Lady\nHelena, who could not help laughing.\n\n\"Accept my arm,\" said the gallant geographer.\n\n\"Has your lordship any orders to give?\" inquired Captain Mangles.\n\n\"After breakfast, my dear fellow,\" replied Glenarvan, \"we will discuss\nin council the programme of the new expedition.\"\n\nThe passengers and the young captain then descended to the cabin.\nOrders were given to the engineer to keep up steam, that they might\nstart at the first signal. The major and the travelers, after a rapid\ntoilette, seated themselves at the table. Ample justice was done to\nMr. Olbinett's repast, which was declared excellent and even superior\nto the splendid banquets of the Pampas. Paganel called twice for every\ndish, \"through absent-mindedness,\" as he said. This unfortunate word\nled Lady Helena to inquire if the amiable Frenchman had occasionally\nshown his habitual failing. The major and Lord Glenarvan looked at each\nother with a smile. As for Paganel, he laughed heartily, and promised\n\"upon his honor\" not to commit a single blunder during the entire\nvoyage. He then in a very comical way told the story of his mistake in\nthe study of Spanish.\n\n\"After all,\" he added, in conclusion, \"misfortunes are sometimes\nbeneficial, and I do not regret my error.\"\n\n\"And why, my worthy friend?\" asked the major.\n\n\"Because I not only know Spanish, but Portuguese also. I speak two\nlanguages instead of one.\"\n\n\"By my faith, I should not have thought of that,\" replied MacNabb. \"My\ncompliments, Paganel, my sincere compliments!\"\n\n[Sidenote: TABLE-TALK IN THE SOUTH ATLANTIC.]\n\nPaganel was applauded, but did not lose a single mouthful. He did not,\nhowever, notice one peculiarity observed by Glenarvan, and that was the\nyoung captain's attentions to his neighbor, Mary Grant.

The Patagonian took two steps forward;\nGlenarvan took his hand, and pressed it. There was in the latter's\nlook, in his physiognomy, such a feeling, such an expression of\ngratitude, that the native could not mistake it. He inclined his head\ngently, and uttered a few words that neither the major nor his friend\ncould understand.\n\nThe Patagonian, after regarding the strangers attentively, now changed\nthe language; but whatever it was, this new idiom was no better\nunderstood than the first.

And opening his mouth widely in order to articulate\nbetter, he said, in his best Spanish,--\n\n\"You--are--a--brave--man.\"\n\nThe native listened, but did not answer.\n\n\"He does not understand,\" said the geographer.\n\n\"Perhaps you do not pronounce well,\" replied the major.\n\n\"Very true!

And pronouncing with\nmagisterial slowness, he uttered these words,--\n\n\"A--Patagonian,--doubtless?\"\n\nThe native remained mute as before.\n\n\"Answer!\" added Paganel.\n\nThe Patagonian did not reply.\n\n\"Do--you--understand?\" cried Paganel, violently enough to damage his\norgans of speech.\n\nIt was evident that the Indian did not understand, for he answered, but\nin Spanish,--\n\n\"I do not understand.\"\n\nIt was Paganel's turn now to be astonished, and he hastily put on his\nglasses, like one irritated.\n\n\"May I be hanged,\" said he, \"if I understand a word of this infernal\njargon!

She\ncut the Tropic of Capricorn, and her prow was headed toward the strait\nof the celebrated geographer. Now and then the low shores of Patagonia\nwere seen, but like an almost invisible line on the horizon. They\nsailed along the coast for more than ten miles, but Paganel's famous\ntelescope gave him only a vague idea of these American shores.\n\nThe vessel soon found herself at the head of the strait, and entered\nwithout hesitation. This way is generally preferred by steam-vessels\nbound for the Pacific. Its exact length is three hundred and\nseventy-six miles. Ships of the greatest tonnage can always find deep\nwater, even near its shores, an excellent bottom, and many springs of\nwater. The rivers abound in fish, the forest in game, there are safe\nand easy landings at twenty places, and, in short, a thousand resources\nthat are wanting in the Strait of Lemaire, and off the terrible rocks\nof Cape Horn, which are continually visited by storms and tempests.\n\n[Illustration: Sometimes the tips of her yards would graze the branches\nof the beeches that hung over the waves.]\n\nDuring the first hours of the passage, till you reach Cape Gregory,\nthe shores are low and sandy. The entire passage lasted scarcely\nthirty-six hours, and this moving panorama of the two shores well\nrewarded the pains the geographer took to admire it under the radiant\nbeams of the southern sun. No inhabitant appeared on the shores of the\ncontinent; and only a few Fuegians wandered along the barren rocks of\nTerra del Fuego.\n\nAt one moment the Duncan rounded the peninsula of Brunswick between\ntwo magnificent sights. Just here the strait cuts between stupendous\nmasses of granite. The base of the mountains was hidden in the heart\nof immense forests, while their summits, whitened with eternal snow,\nwere lost in the clouds. Towards the southeast Mount Taru towered\nsix thousand five hundred feet aloft. Night came, preceded by a long\ntwilight, the light melting away insensibly by gentle degrees, while\nthe sky was studded with brilliant stars.\n\nIn the midst of this partial obscurity, the yacht boldly continued on\nher course, without casting anchor in the safe bays with which the\nshores abound. Sometimes the tips of her yards would graze the branches\nof the beeches that hung over the waves. At others her propeller would\nbeat the waters of the great rivers, starting geese, ducks, snipe,\nteal, and all the feathered tribes of the marshes. Soon deserted ruins\nappeared, and fallen monuments, to which the night lent a grand aspect;\nthese were the mournful remains of an abandoned colony, whose name\nwill be an eternal contradiction to the fertility of the coasts and\nthe rich game of the forests. It was Port Famine, the place that the\nSpaniard Sarmiento colonized in 1581 with four hundred emigrants. Here\nhe founded the city of San Felipe. But the extreme severity of the cold\nweakened the colony; famine devoured those whom the winter had spared,\nand in 1587 the explorer Cavendish found the last of these four hundred\nunfortunates dying of hunger amid the ruins of a city only six years in\nexistence.\n\n[Sidenote: CHEERLESS MEMORIES.]\n\nThe vessel coasted along these deserted shores. At daybreak she sailed\nin the midst of the narrow passes, between beeches, ash-trees, and\nbirches, from the bosom of which emerged ivy-clad domes, cupolas\ntapestried with the hardy holly, and lofty spires, among which the\nobelisk of Buckland rose to a great height. Far out in the sea sported\ndroves of seals and whales of great size, judging by their spouting,\nwhich could be seen at a distance of four miles. At last they doubled\nCape Froward, still bristling with the ices of winter. On the other\nside of the strait, on Terra del Fuego, rose Mount Sarmiento to the\nheight of six thousand feet, an enormous mass of rock broken by bands\nof clouds which formed as it were an aerial archipelago in the sky.\n\n[Illustration"}, {"chunk_id": 51, "text": " Paganel, he did not leave the Indian. He became Thalcave's\nshadow, and could not remain quiet in the presence of a real\nPatagonian, in comparison with whom he would have passed for a dwarf.\nHe overwhelmed the grave Indian with Spanish phrases, to which the\nlatter quietly listened. The geographer studied this time without a\nbook, and was often heard repeating words aloud.\n\n\"If I do not get the accent,\" said he to the major, \"you must not be\nangry with me. Who would have thought that one day a Patagonian would\nteach me Spanish!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\nNEWS OF THE LOST CAPTAIN.\n\n\nAt eight o'clock the next morning Thalcave gave the signal for\ndeparture. The slope was gradual, and the travelers had only to descend\na gentle declivity to the sea.\n\nWhen the Patagonian declined the horse that Glenarvan offered him, the\nlatter thought that he preferred to go on foot, according to the custom\nof certain guides; and indeed, his long legs ought to have made walking\neasy. But he was mistaken.\n\nAt the moment of departure Thalcave whistled in a peculiar manner.\nImmediately a magnificent Argentine horse, of superb form, issued from\na small wood near by, and approached at the call of his master. The\nanimal was perfectly beautiful. His brown color indicated a sound,\nspirited and courageous beast. He had a small and elegantly poised\nhead, widely opening nostrils, a fiery eye, large hams, swelling\nwithers, broad breast, long pasterns, in short, all the qualities that\nconstitute strength and suppleness. The major, like a perfect horseman,\nadmired unreservedly this specimen of the horses of the plains. This\nbeautiful creature was called Thaouka, which means \"bird\" in the\nPatagonian language, and he justly merited this appellation.\n\n[Sidenote: A FRESH START.]\n\nWhen Thalcave was in the saddle, the horse pranced with spirited grace,\nand the Patagonian, a skillful rider, was magnificent to behold. His\noutfit comprised two weapons of the chase, the \"bolas\" and the lasso.\nThe bolas consists of three balls tied together by a leathern string,\nwhich are fastened to the front of the saddle. The Indians frequently\nthrow them the distance of a hundred paces at the animal or enemy that\nthey are pursuing, and with such precision that they twist about their\nlegs and bring them to the ground. It is, therefore, in their hands a\nformidable instrument, and they handle it with surprising dexterity.\nThe lasso, on the contrary, does not leave the hand that wields it. It\nconsists simply of a leathern thong thirty feet in length, terminating\nin a slip-noose which works upon an iron ring. The right hand throws\nthe slip-noose, while the left hand holds the remainder of the lasso,\nthe end of which is firmly tied to the saddle. A long carbine in a\nsling completed the Patagonian's armament.\n\nThalcave, without observing the admiration caused by his natural\ngrace, ease and courage, took the lead, and the party advanced, now\nat a gallop, and now at a walk, for their horses seemed entirely\nunaccustomed to trotting. Robert mounted with much boldness, and\nspeedily convinced Glenarvan of his ability to keep his seat.\n\nOn issuing from the gorges of the Andes, they encountered a great\nnumber of sand-ridges, called \"medanos,\" real waves incessantly\nagitated by the wind, when the roots of the herbage did not confine\nthem to the earth. This sand is of an extreme fineness; and, at the\nleast breath, they saw it float away in light clouds, or form regular\nsand-columns which rose to a considerable height. This spectacle caused\npleasure as well as annoyance to the eyes. Pleasure, for nothing was\nmore curious than these columns, wandering over the plain, struggling,\nmingling, sinking and rising in inexpressible confusion; and annoyance,\nsince an impalpable dust emanated from these innumerable medanos and\npenetrated the eyelids, however tightly they were closed.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThis phenomenon continued during a great part of the day.

It seemed as if a part of beautiful Normandy\nhad been cast into these monotonous regions, and under any other\ncircumstances the eye of a traveler would have been struck with this\nsudden transition from desert to oasis, from snowy peak to verdant\nprairie, from winter to summer.\n\nThe earth had regained an absolute immobility, and the earthquake had\nceased.

This time, however, the\ncommotion had been of extreme violence. The outline of the mountains\nwas entirely changed; a new view of summits, crests, and peaks was\ndefined against the azure of the sky; and the guide of the Pampas would\nhave sought in vain for his accustomed landmarks.\n\n[Sidenote: COMEDY CHANGED TO TRAGEDY.]\n\nA wonderfully beautiful day was breaking. The rays of the sun, issuing\nfrom their watery bed in the Atlantic, glittered over the Argentine\nplains and were already silvering the waves of the other ocean. It was\neight o'clock in the morning.\n\nGlenarvan and his companions, revived by the aid of the major,\ngradually recovered consciousness. Indeed, they had only undergone\na severe giddiness. The mountain was descended, and they would have\napplauded a means of locomotion which had been entirely at nature's\nexpense, if one of the feeblest, Robert Grant, had not been missing.\nEvery one loved the courageous boy: Paganel was particularly attached\nto him; the major, too, in spite of his coldness; but especially\nGlenarvan.\n\nWhen the latter learned of Robert's disappearance, he was desperate. He\npictured to himself the poor child engulfed in some abyss, and calling\nvainly for him whom he considered his second father.\n\n\"My friends,\" said he, scarcely restraining his tears, \"we must search\nfor him, we must find him! We cannot abandon him thus! Every valley,\nevery precipice, every abyss must be explored to the very bottom! You\nshall tie a rope around me and let me down! I will do it, you hear me,\nI will! May Heaven grant that Robert is still living! Without him,\nhow could we dare find his father? What right have we to save Captain\nGrant, if his rescue costs the life of his child?\"\n\nHis companions listened without speaking. They felt that he was seeking\nin their looks some ray of hope, and they lowered their eyes.\n\n\"Well,\" continued Glenarvan, \"you understand me; you are silent! You\nhave no more hope!\"\n\nA few moments of silence ensued, when MacNabb inquired:\n\n\"Who of you, my friends, remembers when Robert disappeared?\"\n\nTo this question no answer was given.\n\n\"At least,\" continued the major, \"you can tell with whom the boy was\nduring the descent.\"\n\n\"With me,\" replied Wilson.\n\n\"Well, at what moment did you last see him with you? Recall the\ncircumstances. Speak.\"\n\n\"This is all that I remember. Robert Grant was at my side, his hand\ngrasping a tuft of moss, less than two minutes before the shock that\ncaused our descent.\"\n\n\"Less than two minutes? Remember, Wilson, the minutes may have seemed\nlong to you. Are you not mistaken?\"\n\n\"I think not--yes, it is so, less than two minutes.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said MacNabb; \"and was Robert on your right, or on your left?\"\n\n\"On my left. I remember that his poncho flapped in my face.\"\n\n\"And where were you situated in reference to us?\"\n\n\"On the left also.\"\n\n\"Then Robert could have disappeared only on this side,\" said the major,\nturning towards the mountain, and pointing to the right. \"And also\nconsidering the time that has elapsed since his disappearance, the\nchild must have fallen at a high part of the mountain. There we must\n"}, {"chunk_id": 31, "text": "ght to make known by means\nof this bottle the place of their captivity.\"\n\n\"Simply, my dear Paganel, because to throw a bottle into the sea it is\nnecessary, at least, that the sea should be before you.\"\n\n\"Or, in the absence of the sea,\" added Paganel, \"the rivers which flow\ninto it.\"\n\nAn astonished silence followed this unexpected, yet reasonable, answer.\nBy the flash that brightened the eyes of his hearers Paganel knew that\neach of them had conceived a new hope. Lady Helena was the first to\nresume the conversation.\n\n\"What an idea!\" she exclaimed.\n\n\"What a _good_ idea!\" added the geographer, simply.\n\n\"Your advice then?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"My advice is to find the thirty-seventh parallel, just where it meets\nthe American coast, and follow it, without deviating half a degree, to\nthe point where it strikes the Atlantic. Perhaps we shall find on its\ncourse the survivors of the Britannia.\"\n\n\"A feeble chance,\" replied the major.\n\n\"However feeble it may be,\" continued Paganel, \"we ought not to neglect\nit. If I am right that this bottle reached the sea by following the\ncurrent of a river, we cannot fail to come upon the traces of the\nprisoners. Look, my friends, look at the map of this country, and I\nwill convince you beyond a doubt.\"\n\n[Sidenote: NIL DESPERANDUM!]\n\nSo saying, Paganel spread out before them upon the table a large map of\nChili and the Argentine Provinces. \"Look,\" said he, \"and follow me in\nthis passage across the American continent. Let us pass over the narrow\nstrip of Chili and the Cordilleras of the Andes, and descend into the\nmidst of the Pampas. Are rivers, streams, water-courses, wanting in\nthese regions? No. Here are the Rio Negro, the Rio Colorado, and their\naffluents, cut by the thirty-seventh parallel, all of which might have\nserved to transport the document. There, perhaps, in the midst of a\ntribe, in the hands of settled Indians, on the shores of these unknown\nrivers, in the gorges of the sierras, those whom I have the right to\ncall our friends are awaiting an interposition of Providence. Ought\nwe, then, to disappoint their hopes? Do you not think we should follow\nacross these countries an unswerving course? And if, contrary to all\nexpectation, I am still mistaken, is it not our duty to trace this\nparallel to the very end, and, if necessary, make upon it the tour of\nthe world?\"\n\nThese words, spoken with a noble enthusiasm, excited a deep emotion\namong Paganel's hearers. All rose to shake hands with him.\n\n\"Yes, my father is there!\" cried Robert Grant, devouring the map with\nhis eyes.\n\n\"And wherever he is,\" replied Glenarvan, \"we shall find him, my child.\nNothing is more consistent than our friend Paganel's interpretation,\nand we must follow without hesitation the course he has indicated.\nEither Captain Grant is in the hands of countless Indians, or is\nprisoner in a feeble tribe. In the latter case, we will rescue him. In\nthe former, after ascertaining his situation, we will join the Duncan\non the eastern coast, sail to Buenos Ayres, and with a detachment,\norganized by the major, can overcome all the Indians of the Argentine\nPlains.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, your lordship,\" answered Captain Mangles; \"and I will add\nthat this passage of the continent will be without peril.\"\n\n\"Without peril, or fatigue,\" continued Paganel. \"How many have already\naccomplished it who had scarcely our means for success, and whose\ncourage was not sustained by the grandeur of the undertaking!\"\n\n\"Sir, sir,\" exclaimed Mary Grant, in a voice broken with emotion, \"how\ncan I thank a devotion that exposes you to so many dangers?\"\n\n\"Dangers!\" cried Paganel. \"Who uttered the word _danger_?\"\n\n\"Not I!\" replied Robert Grant, with flashing eye and determined look.\n\n\"Danger!\" repeated Paganel; \"does such a thing exist?

The sailors worked their\nway along like porpoises in their native element. As for Robert, he\nclung to Thaouka's mane, and was thus drawn along.

But Thaouka, carried away by the current, was rapidly\ndisappearing. He turned his intelligent head towards his master, and,\nshaking his long mane, neighed for him beseechingly.\n\n[Illustration: A huge wave, forty feet high, overwhelmed the fugitives\nwith a terrible roar.

A few moments after, his arm\nrested upon the neck of Thaouka, and horse and horseman swam away\ntogether towards the misty horizon of the north.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII.\n\nA SINGULAR ABODE.\n\n\nThe tree upon which Glenarvan and his companions had just found refuge\nresembled a walnut-tree. It had the same shining foliage and rounded\nform. It was the \"ombu,\" which is met with only on the Argentine\nPlains. It had an enormous, twisted trunk, and was confined to the\nearth not only by its great roots, but also by strong shoots which held\nit most tenaciously. It had thus resisted the force of the inundation.\n\n[Sidenote: AN ORNITHOLOGICAL OMNIUM-GATHERUM.]\n\nThis ombu measured one hundred feet in height, and might have covered\nwith its shade a circumference of three hundred and sixty feet. All\nthe upper part rested on three great branches, which forked from the\ntop of the trunk, that was six feet in diameter. Two of these branches\nwere nearly perpendicular, and supported the immense canopy of foliage,\nwhose crossed, twisted, and interlaced limbs, as if woven by the hand\nof a basket-maker, formed an impenetrable shelter. The third branch,\non the contrary, extended almost horizontally over the roaring waters;\nits leaves were bathed in them, while it seemed a promontory to this\nisland of verdure surrounded by an ocean. There was abundant space,\nalso, in the interior of this gigantic tree. The foliage, which was\nnot very dense at its outer circumference, left large openings like\nsky-lights, and made it well ventilated and cool. At sight of these\nbranches rising in innumerable ramifications towards the clouds, while\nthe parasitic convolvuli bound them to each other, and the rays of the\nsun shone through the interstices of the leaves, you would really have\nthought that the trunk of this ombu bore upon itself alone an entire\nforest.\n\nOn the arrival of the fugitives, a feathered population flew away to\nthe top branches, protesting by their cries against so flagran"}, {"chunk_id": 196, "text": "scene of cannibalism, which followed in all\nits horrible details.]\n\n[Illustration: The corpses, folded together, in a sitting posture,\nand tied in their clothes by a girdle of withes, were placed on this\nprimitive bier.]\n\nBut Kai-Koumou had preserved his reason in the midst of the general\nintoxication. He allowed this bloody orgy an hour to reach its utmost\nintensity. The last act of the funeral was played with the usual rites.\n\nThe bodies of Kara-Tété and his wife were taken up, and their limbs\nbent and gathered against the stomach, according to the New Zealand\ncustom. The place for the tomb had been chosen outside of the\nfortification, about two miles distant, on the summit of a small\nmountain, called Maunganamu, situated on the right shore of the lake.\n\nThither the bodies were to be carried. Two very rude palanquins, or\nrather litters, were brought to the foot of the mound. The corpses,\nfolded together, in a sitting posture, and tied in their clothes by a\ngirdle of withes, were placed on this primitive bier. Four warriors\nbore it between them, and the entire tribe, chanting the funeral hymn,\nfollowed them in procession to the place of burial.\n\nThe captives, who were always watched, saw them leave the inner\ninclosure of the pah, and then the songs and cries gradually died away.\nFor about half an hour this funeral escort continued in sight, in the\ndepths of the valley. Finally they perceived it again winding along\nthe mountain paths. The distance gave a fantastic appearance to the\nundulating movements of the long, sinuous column.\n\nThe tribe stopped at the summit of the mountain, which was eight\nhundred feet high, at the place prepared for Kara-Tété's interment.\nA common Maori would have had only a hole and a heap of stones for a\ngrave; but for a powerful and dreaded chief, destined doubtless for a\nspeedy deification, a tomb worthy of his exploits was reserved.\n\n[Sidenote: THE LAST NIGHT.]\n\nThe sepulchre had been surrounded by palisades, while stakes,\nornamented with faces reddened with ochre, stood beside the grave\nwhere the bodies were to lie. The relatives had not forgotten that the\n\"waidoua\" (the spirit of the dead) feeds on substantial nourishment\nlike the body during this perishable life. Food had therefore been\ndeposited in the inclosure, together with the weapons and clothes of\nthe deceased.\n\nNothing was wanting for the comfort of the tomb. Husband and wife were\nlaid side by side, and then covered with earth and grass after a series\nof renewed lamentations. Then the procession silently descended the\nmountain, and now no one could ascend it under penalty of death, for it\nwas tabooed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LI.\n\nSTRANGELY LIBERATED.\n\n\nJust as the sun was disappearing behind Lake Taupo, the captives were\nled back to their prison. They were not to leave it again until the\nsummit of the Wahiti mountains should kindle with the first beams of\nthe day. One night remained to prepare for death. In spite of the\nfaintness, in spite of the horror with which they were seized, they\nshared their repast in common.\n\n\"We shall need all the strength possible to face death,\" said\nGlenarvan. \"We must show these barbarians how Europeans and Christians\ncan die.\"\n\nThe meal being finished, Lady Helena repeated the evening prayer aloud,\nwhile all her companions, with uncovered heads, joined her. Having\nfulfilled this duty, and enjoyed this privilege, the prisoners embraced\neach other. Lady Helena and Mary Grant then retired to one corner of\nthe hut, and stretched themselves upon a mat. Sleep, which soothes all\nwoes, soon closed their eyes, and they slumbered in each other's arms,\novercome by fatigue and long wakefulness.\n\nGlenarvan, taking his friends aside, said:\n\n\"My dear companions, our lives and those of these poor ladies are in\nGod's hands. If Heaven has decreed that we shall die to-morrow, we can,\nI am sure, die like brave people, like Christians, ready to appear\nfearlessly before the final Judge.

He knew well that the animals would not\nabandon a certain prey until at daybreak they returned to their holes\nand dens.\n\nHowever, the tactics of their enemies had evidently changed, they no\nlonger endeavored to force the entrance of the ramada; but their new\nmanoeuvres were already causing a still more imminent danger.\n\nThe wolves, abandoning their design of penetrating the inclosure by\nthis entrance, which was defended by weapon and fire, went to the\nback of the ramada and sought to assail it in the rear. Their claws\nwere soon heard rattling against the half-decayed wood. Already their\npowerful paws and bloody mouths had forced their way between the\nshattered stakes. The horses, bewildered and panic-stricken, broke\ntheir halters and dashed into the inclosure. Glenarvan seized Robert\nin his arms, to defend him to the last extremity; and he would have\nattempted a rash flight, and rushed out of the ramada, had not his eyes\nfallen upon the Indian.\n\nThalcave, turning like a deer, had suddenly approached his horse,\nwhich was neighing with impatience, and was beginning to saddle him\ncarefully, forgetting neither strap nor buckle. He seemed no longer to\ncare for the howls, that were now redoubled. Glenarvan gazed at him\nwith a dark foreboding.\n\n\"He is leaving us!\" cried he, seeing Thalcave gather up his reins as\nthough he were about to mount.\n\n\"He? never!\" said Robert.\n\nIn truth the Indian was about to make a venture, not to leave his\nfriends, but to save them by sacrificing himself. Thaouka was ready.\nHe champed his bit; he pranced; his eyes, full of a fiery spirit, shot\nforth lightning flashes; he understood his master.\n\nJust as the Indian was seizing the mane of his horse, Glenarvan caught\nhim by the arm with a convulsive grasp.\n\n\"You are going?\" said he, pointing to the plain, which was now deserted.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the Indian, who comprehended the gesture of his\ncompanion; and, with vehement gesticulations which were however\nperfectly intelligible, he added a few words in Spanish, which\nsignified: \"Thaouka--good horse--swift--will draw the wolves after him.\"\n\n[Illustration: Frightful howls resounded. The wolves, starting on the\ntrack of the horse, fled into the darkness with a terrible speed.]\n\n\"Ha! Thalcave!\" cried Glenarvan.\n\n\"Quick, quick!\" continued the Indian; while Glenarvan said to Robert,\nin a voice broken by emotion,--\n\n\"Robert, my lad, you hear! He will sacrifice himself for us; he will\nrush out over the plain, and turn aside the fury of the wolves upon\nhimself.\"\n\n\"Friend Thalcave,\" replied Robert, looking imploringly at the\nPatagonian, \"friend Thalcave, do not leave us!\"\n\n\"No,\" said Glenarvan, \"he will not leave us.\"\n\nAnd, turning to the Indian, he added, pointing to the terrified horses\ncrowding against the stakes,--\n\n\"Let us go together.\"\n\n\"No,\" said the Indian, who was not mistaken as to the meaning of these\nwords. \"Bad beasts--frightened--Thaouka--good horse.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Glenarvan. \"Thalcave shall not leave, Robert. He\nshows me what I have to do. It is my duty to go, and his to remain with\nyou.\"\n\nThen, seizing Thaouka's bridle, he added,--\n\n\"I will go.\"\n\n\"No,\" replied the Patagonian, calmly.\n\n\"I tell you,\" cried Glenarvan, taking the bridle from the hands of the\nIndian, \"I will go. Save this boy! I trust him to you, Thalcave!\"\n\nGlenarvan, in his excitement, mingled English and Spanish together. But\nwhat matters the language? In such a terrible situation, signs tell\nall, and men quickly understand each other.\n\n[Sidenote: SAFETY FOR TWO.]\n\nHowever, Thalcave resisted, and the discussion was prolonged. The\ndanger was increasing every moment. Already the broken stakes were\nyielding to the teeth and claws of the wolves. But neither Glenarvan\nnor Thalcave appeared willing to yield. The Indian had drawn Glenarvan\ntowards the entrance of the inclosure. He pointed to the plain, now\nfree from wolves. In his animated language, he explained that not "}, {"chunk_id": 51, "text": " Paganel, he did not leave the Indian. He became Thalcave's\nshadow, and could not remain quiet in the presence of a real\nPatagonian, in comparison with whom he would have passed for a dwarf.\nHe overwhelmed the grave Indian with Spanish phrases, to which the\nlatter quietly listened. The geographer studied this time without a\nbook, and was often heard repeating words aloud.\n\n\"If I do not get the accent,\" said he to the major, \"you must not be\nangry with me. Who would have thought that one day a Patagonian would\nteach me Spanish!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\nNEWS OF THE LOST CAPTAIN.\n\n\nAt eight o'clock the next morning Thalcave gave the signal for\ndeparture. The slope was gradual, and the travelers had only to descend\na gentle declivity to the sea.\n\nWhen the Patagonian declined the horse that Glenarvan offered him, the\nlatter thought that he preferred to go on foot, according to the custom\nof certain guides; and indeed, his long legs ought to have made walking\neasy. But he was mistaken.\n\nAt the moment of departure Thalcave whistled in a peculiar manner.\nImmediately a magnificent Argentine horse, of superb form, issued from\na small wood near by, and approached at the call of his master. The\nanimal was perfectly beautiful. His brown color indicated a sound,\nspirited and courageous beast. He had a small and elegantly poised\nhead, widely opening nostrils, a fiery eye, large hams, swelling\nwithers, broad breast, long pasterns, in short, all the qualities that\nconstitute strength and suppleness. The major, like a perfect horseman,\nadmired unreservedly this specimen of the horses of the plains. This\nbeautiful creature was called Thaouka, which means \"bird\" in the\nPatagonian language, and he justly merited this appellation.\n\n[Sidenote: A FRESH START.]\n\nWhen Thalcave was in the saddle, the horse pranced with spirited grace,\nand the Patagonian, a skillful rider, was magnificent to behold. His\noutfit comprised two weapons of the chase, the \"bolas\" and the lasso.\nThe bolas consists of three balls tied together by a leathern string,\nwhich are fastened to the front of the saddle. The Indians frequently\nthrow them the distance of a hundred paces at the animal or enemy that\nthey are pursuing, and with such precision that they twist about their\nlegs and bring them to the ground. It is, therefore, in their hands a\nformidable instrument, and they handle it with surprising dexterity.\nThe lasso, on the contrary, does not leave the hand that wields it. It\nconsists simply of a leathern thong thirty feet in length, terminating\nin a slip-noose which works upon an iron ring. The right hand throws\nthe slip-noose, while the left hand holds the remainder of the lasso,\nthe end of which is firmly tied to the saddle. A long carbine in a\nsling completed the Patagonian's armament.\n\nThalcave, without observing the admiration caused by his natural\ngrace, ease and courage, took the lead, and the party advanced, now\nat a gallop, and now at a walk, for their horses seemed entirely\nunaccustomed to trotting. Robert mounted with much boldness, and\nspeedily convinced Glenarvan of his ability to keep his seat.\n\nOn issuing from the gorges of the Andes, they encountered a great\nnumber of sand-ridges, called \"medanos,\" real waves incessantly\nagitated by the wind, when the roots of the herbage did not confine\nthem to the earth. This sand is of an extreme fineness; and, at the\nleast breath, they saw it float away in light clouds, or form regular\nsand-columns which rose to a considerable height. This spectacle caused\npleasure as well as annoyance to the eyes. Pleasure, for nothing was\nmore curious than these columns, wandering over the plain, struggling,\nmingling, sinking and rising in inexpressible confusion; and annoyance,\nsince an impalpable dust emanated from these innumerable medanos and\npenetrated the eyelids, however tightly they were closed.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThis phenomenon continued during a great part of the day. Nevertheless,\nthey advanced rapidly, and towards six o'clock the A"}, {"chunk_id": 76, "text": "ormy. The sides of the rancho cracked as if they would\nbreak, while the frail structure bent beneath the gusts of wind and\nthreatened to give way at every shock. The unfortunate horses neighed\nin terror without, exposed to the inclemency of the tempest; and their\nmasters did not suffer less in their miserable shelter. However, sleep\ndrowned all their troubles at last. Robert first closed his eyes,\nreclining his head on Lord Glenarvan's shoulder; and soon all the\ninmates of the rancho slept under the protection of God.\n\nThey woke the next morning at the call of Thaouka, who, always ready,\nneighed without, and struck the wall of the hut vigorously with his\nhoof, as though to give the signal for departure. They owed him too\nmuch not to obey him, and they accordingly resumed their journey.\n\nThe rain had ceased, but the hard earth held what had fallen. On the\nimpenetrable clay, pools, marshes, and ponds overflowed and formed\nimmense \"bañados\" of treacherous depth. Paganel, on consulting his map,\njudged rightly that the Grande and Nivarota Rivers, into which the\nwaters of the plain usually flow, must have mingled together in one\nbroad stream.\n\nAn extremely rapid advance, therefore, became necessary. The common\nsafety was at stake. If the inundation increased, where could they find\na refuge? The vast circle of the horizon did not offer a single point,\nand on this level plain the progress of the water must be rapid. The\nhorses were urged to their utmost speed. Thaouka took the lead, and\nmight have borne the name of sea-horse, for he pranced as if he had\nbeen in his native element.\n\nSuddenly, about six o'clock in the evening, he manifested signs of\nextreme agitation. He turned frequently towards the vast expanse to the\nsouth; his neighs were prolonged, his nostrils keenly snuffed the air,\nand he reared violently. Thalcave, whom his antics could not unseat,\nmanaged his steed without difficulty. The froth from the horse's mouth\nwas mingled with blood under the action of the firmly-closed bit, and\nyet the spirited animal could not be calm. If free, his master felt but\ntoo well that he would have fled away at full speed towards the north.\n\n\"What is the matter with Thaouka?\" asked Paganel. \"Has he been bitten\nby those voracious blood-suckers of the Argentine waters?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied the Indian.\n\n\"Is he terrified, then, at some danger?\"\n\n\"Yes, he has scented danger.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"I do not know.\"\n\nAlthough the eye did not yet reveal the peril that Thaouka divined,\nthe ear could already detect it. A low murmur, like the sound of a\nrising tide, was heard as from the limit of the horizon. The wind blew\nin damp gusts laden with spray; the birds, as if fleeing from some\nunknown phenomenon, shot swiftly through the air; and the horses,\nwading to their knees, felt the first impulse of the current. Soon a\nmingled roar, like bellowing, neighing, and bleating, resounded half\na mile to the south, and immense herds appeared, tumbling, rising,\nand rushing, a confused mass of terrified beasts, and fled by with\nfrightful rapidity. It was scarcely possible to distinguish them in the\nmidst of the clouds of spray dashed up by their flight.\n\n[Illustration: \"The flood! the flood!\" replied Thalcave, spurring his\nhorse towards the north.]\n\n\"Quick! quick!\" cried Thalcave, in a piercing voice.\n\n\"What is it?\" said Paganel.\n\n\"The flood! the flood!\" replied Thalcave, spurring his horse towards\nthe north.\n\n\"The inundation!\" cried Paganel; and his companions, with him at their\nhead, fled away in the track of Thaouka.\n\nIt was time. Five miles to the south a high and broad wall of water\nwas rushing over the plain, which was fast becoming an ocean. The tall\ngrass disappeared as before the scythe, and the tufts of mimosas, torn\nup by the current, separated and formed floating islands. The mass of\nwaters spread itself in broad waves of irresistible power. The dikes of\nthe great rivers had evidently given way, and perhaps the waters of the\nColorado and Rio Negro were now mingling"}]}

Captain Mangles and the major\nrushed towards it. In a few moments they perceived, on the edge of\nthe coppice, a human form that was dragging itself along and groaning\npiteously. It was Mulready, wounded and half dead. When his companions\nraised him, they felt their hands dabbling in blood. The rain now\nincreased, and the wind howled through the branches of the dead trees.\nIn the midst of these terrific gusts, Glenarvan, the major, and the\ncaptain bore the body of Mulready.\n\nOn arriving at the cart, Paganel, Robert, Wilson, and Olbinett came\nout, and Lady Helena gave up her room to the poor sailor. The major\ntook off Mulready's vest, wet with blood and rain. He discovered the\nwound. It was a poniard stab, which the unfortunate had received in his\nright side.\n\nMacNabb dressed it skillfully.

What did\nMulready mean? Ben Joyce had attacked the sailor, but why? Was it not\nsimply for the purpose of preventing him from reaching the Duncan? This\nletter--Glenarvan examined the sailor's pockets. The letter addressed\nto Tom Austin was gone.\n\nThe night passed in anxiety and anguish. They feared every moment that\nthe wounded man would die. A burning fever consumed him. Lady Helena\nand Mary Grant, as though his sisters, did not leave him; never was\npatient better nursed, or by more tender hands.\n\nDay appeared. The rain had ceased. Heavy clouds still rolled along\nthe vault of the sky, and the earth was strewn with the fragments of\nbranches. The clay, soaked by floods of water, had yielded; and the\nsides of the cart became unsteady, but sank no deeper.\n\nCaptain Mangles, Paganel, and Glenarvan took a tour of exploration\naround the camp. They traversed the path still marked with blood, but\nfound no trace of Ben Joyce or his band. They went to the place where\nthe attack had been made. Here two corpses lay on the ground, shot\nby Mulready. One was the farrier of Black Point. His face, which had\nmortified, was a horrible sight.\n\nGlenarvan did not pursue his investigations farther, prudence\nforbidding. He therefore returned to the cart, much alarmed by the\nseriousness of the situation.\n\n\"We cannot think of sending another messenger to Melbourne,\" said he.\n\n\"But we must,\" replied Captain Mangles; \"and I will make the attempt,\nsince my sailor has failed.\"\n\n\"No, John. You have not even a horse to carry you these two hundred\nmiles.\"\n\nIndeed, Mulready's horse, the only one that remained, had not\nreappeared. Had he fallen beneath the shots of the murderers? Was he\nrunning wild over the desert? Had the convicts captured him?\n\n[Illustration: In the midst of these terrific gusts, Glenarvan, the\nmajor, and the captain bore the body of Mulready.]\n\n[Sidenote: RESOLUTION, AND RECOVERY.]\n\n\"Whatever happens,\" continued Glenarvan, \"we will separate no more.\nLet us wait eight or fifteen days, till the waters of the river resume\ntheir natural level. We will then reach Twofold Bay by short journeys,\nand"}, {"chunk_id": 56, "text": "drink very much in use in South America. It is the Indian's tea,\nconsisting of a decoction of leaves dried in the fire, and is imbibed\nthrough a straw. At Paganel's request, Thalcave prepared several\ncups of this beverage, which very agreeably accompanied the ordinary\neatables, and was declared excellent.\n\n[Sidenote: A CHANGE FOR THE WORSE.]\n\nThe next day they resumed their journey towards the east. About noon\na change took place in the appearance of the Pampas, which could\nnot escape eyes wearied with its monotony. The grass became more and\nmore scanty, and gave place to sickly burdocks and gigantic thistles;\nwhile stunted nettles and other thorny shrubs grew here and there.\nHeretofore, a certain moisture, preserved by the clay of the prairie,\nfreshened the meadows; the vegetation was thick and luxuriant. But now\na patchy growth, bare in many places, exposed the earth, and indicated\nthe poverty of the soil. These signs of increasing dryness could not be\nmistaken, and Thalcave called attention to them.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"I am not sorry at this change,\" said Tom Austin; \"to see always grass,\nnothing but grass, becomes tiresome before long.\"\n\n\"But where there is grass there is water,\" replied the major.\n\n\"Oh, we are not in want,\" said Wilson, \"and shall find some river on\nour course.\"\n\nHowever, when Wilson said that the supply of water would not fail\nhe had not calculated for the unquenchable thirst that consumed his\ncompanions all that day; and, when he added that they would meet with\nsome stream in their journey he had anticipated too much. Indeed, not\nonly were rivers wanting, but even the artificial wells dug by the\nIndians were empty. On seeing these indications of dryness increase\nfrom mile to mile, Paganel asked Thalcave where he expected to find\nwater.\n\n\"At Lake Salinas,\" replied the Indian.\n\n\"And when shall we arrive there?\"\n\n\"To-morrow evening.\"\n\nThe natives ordinarily, when they travel on the Pampas, dig wells, and\nfind water a few feet below the surface; but the travelers, destitute\nof the necessary implements, could not employ this expedient. It was\ntherefore necessary to obtain a supply in some other way, for, if they\ndid not absolutely suffer from the tormenting desire for drink, no one\ncould entirely allay his thirst.\n\nAt evening they halted, after a journey of thirty miles. Every one\nrelied upon a good night to recruit himself after the fatigues of\nthe day; but they were greatly annoyed by a very persistent swarm of\nmosquitoes, which disappeared, however, after the wind changed.\n\nIf the major preserved his calmness in the midst of the petty\nannoyances of life, Paganel, on the contrary, could not treat the\nmatter so indifferently. He fought the mosquitoes, and sadly regretted\nthe absence of his acid-water, which would have soothed the pain of\ntheir bites. Although the major endeavored to console him, he awoke in\na very bad humor.\n\nHowever, he was very easily persuaded to set out at daybreak, for it\nwas important to arrive at Lake Salinas the same day. The horses were\nvery much exhausted: they were dying of thirst; and, although their\nriders had denied themselves on their account, still their share of\nwater had been very limited. The dryness was to-day even greater, and\nthe heat no less intolerable, with the dusty wind, the simoom of the\nPampas.\n\n[Sidenote: INDIANS AHEAD!]\n\nDuring the day the monotony of the journey was interrupted. Mulready,\nwho rode in advance, turned back, signaling the approach of a party of\nIndians. This meeting elicited different opinions. Glenarvan thought\nof the information that these natives might furnish concerning the\nshipwrecked seamen of the Britannia. Thalcave, for his part, scarcely\nenjoyed meeting in his journey the wandering Indians of the plains.\nHe considered them plunderers and robbers, and only sought to avoid\nthem. According to his orders, the little party collected together, and\nmade ready their fire-arms. It was necessary to be prepared for any\nemergency.\n\nThe Indian detachm"}, {"chunk_id": 65, "text": "van, who was listening with intentness.\n\nBut Thalcave shook his head. He knew well that the animals would not\nabandon a certain prey until at daybreak they returned to their holes\nand dens.\n\nHowever, the tactics of their enemies had evidently changed, they no\nlonger endeavored to force the entrance of the ramada; but their new\nmanoeuvres were already causing a still more imminent danger.\n\nThe wolves, abandoning their design of penetrating the inclosure by\nthis entrance, which was defended by weapon and fire, went to the\nback of the ramada and sought to assail it in the rear. Their claws\nwere soon heard rattling against the half-decayed wood. Already their\npowerful paws and bloody mouths had forced their way between the\nshattered stakes. The horses, bewildered and panic-stricken, broke\ntheir halters and dashed into the inclosure. Glenarvan seized Robert\nin his arms, to defend him to the last extremity; and he would have\nattempted a rash flight, and rushed out of the ramada, had not his eyes\nfallen upon the Indian.\n\nThalcave, turning like a deer, had suddenly approached his horse,\nwhich was neighing with impatience, and was beginning to saddle him\ncarefully, forgetting neither strap nor buckle. He seemed no longer to\ncare for the howls, that were now redoubled. Glenarvan gazed at him\nwith a dark foreboding.\n\n\"He is leaving us!\" cried he, seeing Thalcave gather up his reins as\nthough he were about to mount.\n\n\"He? never!\" said Robert.\n\nIn truth the Indian was about to make a venture, not to leave his\nfriends, but to save them by sacrificing himself. Thaouka was ready.\nHe champed his bit; he pranced; his eyes, full of a fiery spirit, shot\nforth lightning flashes; he understood his master.\n\nJust as the Indian was seizing the mane of his horse, Glenarvan caught\nhim by the arm with a convulsive grasp.\n\n\"You are going?\" said he, pointing to the plain, which was now deserted.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the Indian, who comprehended the gesture of his\ncompanion; and, with vehement gesticulations which were however\nperfectly intelligible, he added a few words in Spanish, which\nsignified: \"Thaouka--good horse--swift--will draw the wolves after him.\"\n\n[Illustration: Frightful howls resounded. The wolves, starting on the\ntrack of the horse, fled into the darkness with a terrible speed.]\n\n\"Ha! Thalcave!\" cried Glenarvan.\n\n\"Quick, quick!\" continued the Indian; while Glenarvan said to Robert,\nin a voice broken by emotion,--\n\n\"Robert, my lad, you hear! He will sacrifice himself for us; he will\nrush out over the plain, and turn aside the fury of the wolves upon\nhimself.\"\n\n\"Friend Thalcave,\" replied Robert, looking imploringly at the\nPatagonian, \"friend Thalcave, do not leave us!\"\n\n\"No,\" said Glenarvan, \"he will not leave us.\"\n\nAnd, turning to the Indian, he added, pointing to the terrified horses\ncrowding against the stakes,--\n\n\"Let us go together.\"\n\n\"No,\" said the Indian, who was not mistaken as to the meaning of these\nwords. \"Bad beasts--frightened--Thaouka--good horse.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Glenarvan. \"Thalcave shall not leave, Robert. He\nshows me what I have to do. It is my duty to go, and his to remain with\nyou.\"\n\nThen, seizing Thaouka's bridle, he added,--\n\n\"I will go.\"\n\n\"No,\" replied the Patagonian, calmly.\n\n\"I tell you,\" cried Glenarvan, taking the bridle from the hands of the\nIndian, \"I will go. Save this boy! I trust him to you, Thalcave!\"\n\nGlenarvan, in his excitement, mingled English and Spanish together. But\nwhat matters the language? In such a terrible situation, signs tell\nall, and men quickly understand each other.\n\n[Sidenote: SAFETY FOR TWO.]\n\nHowever, Thalcave resisted, and the discussion was prolonged. The\ndanger was increasing every moment. Already the broken stakes were\nyielding to the teeth and claws of the wolves. But neither Glenarvan\nnor Thalcave appeared willing to yield. The Indian had drawn Glenarvan\ntowards the entrance of the inclosure. He pointed to the plain, now\nfree from wolves. In his animated language, he explained that not "}, {"chunk_id": 3, "text": "ht a coroner was pointing\nout the particulars of a suspicious quest. And Glenarvan was right,\nfor the most insignificant mark in appearance may often lead to an\nimportant discovery.\n\nBefore examining it internally, the bottle was inspected externally.\nIt had a slender neck, the mouth of which was protected by an\niron wire considerably rusted. Its sides were very thick, and\ncapable of supporting a pressure of several atmospheres, betraying\nevidently previous connection with champagne. With these bottles the\nwine-dressers of Aï and Epernay block carriage-wheels without their\nshowing the slightest fracture. This one could, therefore, easily bear\nthe hardships of a long voyage.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"A bottle of the Maison Cliquot,\" said the major quietly; and, as if he\nought to know, his affirmation was accepted without contradiction.\n\n\"My dear major,\" said Lady Helena, \"it matters little what this bottle\nis, provided we know whence it comes.\"\n\n\"We shall know, my dear,\" said Lord Edward, \"and already we can affirm\nthat it has come from a distance. See the petrified particles that\ncover it, these substances mineralized, so to speak, under the action\nof the sea-water. This waif had already taken a long voyage in the\nocean, before being engulfed in the stomach of a shark.\"\n\n\"I cannot but be of your opinion,\" replied the major; \"this fragile\nvase, protected by its strong envelope, must have made a long journey.\"\n\n\"But whence does it come?\" inquired Lady Glenarvan.\n\n\"Wait, my dear Helena, wait. We must be patient with bottles. If I am\nnot greatly mistaken, this one will itself answer all our questions.\"\n\nAnd so saying, Glenarvan began to scrape off the hard particles that\nprotected the neck. Soon the cork appeared, but very much damaged with\nthe salt water.\n\n\"This is a pity,\" said Glenarvan; \"for if there is any paper in it, it\nwill be in a bad condition.\"\n\n\"That's what I fear,\" replied the major.\n\n\"I will add,\" continued Glenarvan, \"that this badly-corked bottle would\nsoon have sunk; and it is fortunate that this shark swallowed it, and\nbrought it on board of the Duncan.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" interposed Captain Mangles; \"it would have been better,\nhowever, had it been caught in the open sea on a well-known latitude\nand longitude. We could then, by studying the atmospheric and marine\ncurrents, have discovered the course traversed; but with a guide like\none of these sharks, that travel against wind and tide, we cannot know\nwhence it comes.\"\n\n\"We shall soon see,\" answered Glenarvan. At the same time he drew out\nthe cork with the greatest care, and a strong saline odor permeated the\ncabin.\n\n\"Well?\" said Lady Helena, with a truly feminine impatience.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Glenarvan; \"I am not mistaken! Here are papers!\"\n\n\"Documents! documents!\" cried Lady Helena.\n\n\"Only,\" replied Glenarvan, \"they appear to be damaged by the water.\nIt is impossible to remove them, for they adhere to the sides of the\nbottle.\"\n\n\"Let us break it,\" said MacNabb.\n\n\"I would rather keep it whole,\" replied Glenarvan.\n\n[Illustration: The fragments soon strewed the table, and several pieces\nof paper were perceived adhering to each other.

It was\nnecessary to use a hammer, for the stony covering had acquired the\nhardness of granite. The fragments soon strewed the table, and several\npieces of paper were perceived adhering to each other.

Then, turning\ntowards Paganel, he pointed to young Robert.\n\n\"A brave boy!\" said he.\n\nGlenarvan, however, asked, even while he admired the lad,--\n\n\"Why, my son, did you not let Thalcave or me try this last chance of\nsaving you?\"\n\n\"My lord,\" replied he, in accents of the liveliest gratitude, \"was it\nnot my duty to sacrifice myself, when Thalcave has saved my life, and\nyou are going to save my father?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX.\n\nSTRANGE SIGNS.\n\n\nAfter their first outbursts of joy at meeting were over, Paganel,\nAustin, Wilson, and Mulready--all who had remained behind, except the\nmajor--were conscious of one thing, namely, that they were suffering\nfrom thirst. Fortunately, the Guamini flowed at no great distance.\nThey accordingly continued their journey, and at seven o'clock in the\nmorning the little party arrived at the ramada. On seeing its entrance\nstrewn with the bodies of the wolves, it was easy to understand the\nviolence of the attack and the vigor of the defense. The travelers,\nafter fully quenching their thirst, devoted their attention to\nbreakfast in the inclosure. The ostrich-steaks were declared excellent,\nand the armadillo, roasted in its own covering, was a delicious dish.\n\n\"To eat reasonably of this,\" said Paganel, \"would be ingratitude\ntowards Providence. We really must eat immoderately.\"\n\nAnd he did so accordingly,--but was not sick, thanks to the clear water\nof the Guamini, which appeared to possess superior digestive properties.\n\n[Sidenote: AEROSTATIC EXPERIMENTS.]\n\nAt ten o'clock Glenarvan gave the signal for departure. The\nwater-bottles were filled, and they set out. The horses, being greatly\nrevived, evinced much spirit, and maintained an easy and almost\ncontinuous canter. The next morning they crossed the boundary which\nseparates the Argentine Plains from the Pampas. Here Thalcave hoped\nto meet the chiefs in whose hands he doubted not that he should find\nHarry Grant and rescue him and his two companions from slavery.\n\nSince they had left the Guamini, the travelers noticed, with great\nsatisfaction, a considerable change in the temperature, thanks to the\ncold winds of Patagonia, which cause continual currents of air. Neither\nman nor beast had any reason to complain, after suffering so much from\ndryness and heat. They therefore pushed on with courage and confidence.\nBut, whatever might have been said, the country seemed to be entirely\nuninhabited, or, to use a more exact word, \"disinhabited.\"\n\nFrequently they skirted the shores of fresh-water lagoons, on whose\nbanks, in the shelter of the bushes, tiny wrens skipped and melodious\nlarks warbled, in company with the brilliant-plumaged tanagers. These\npretty birds gayly fluttered about, heedless of the haughty starlings\nthat strutted on the banks like soldiers with their epaulettes and red\nbreasts. In the thorny coppices the nests of the annubis swung like\nhammocks, and on the shores of the lagoons magnificent flamingoes,\nmarching in regular file, spread their fiery-colored wings to the wind.\nTheir nests were seen, by thousands together, like a small village, in\nthe shape of truncated cones a foot high. The birds were not startled\nat the approach of the travelers, which was contrary to Paganel's\ncalculations.\n\n\"I have been curious for a long time,\" said he to the major, \"to see a\nflamingo fly.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said MacNabb.\n\n\"Now, since I have an opportunity, I shall profit by it.\"\n\n\"Do so, Paganel.\"\n\n\"Come with me, major, and you too, Robert; I need witnesses.\"\n\nAnd Paganel, leaving his companions to go on, proceeded towards the\nflock of flamingoes, followed by Robert and the major.

The Indian had drawn Glenarvan\ntowards the entrance of the inclosure. He pointed to the plain, now\nfree from wolves. In his animated language, he explained that not a\nmoment was to be lost; that the danger, if this plan failed, would be\ngreater for those who remained; in short, that he alone knew Thaouka\nwell enough to employ his marvelous agility and speed for the common\nsafety. Glenarvan blindly persisted in his resolve to sacrifice\nhimself, when suddenly he was pushed violently back. Thaouka pranced,\nreared on his hind legs, and all at once, with a spring, cleared the\nbarrier of fire and the rampart of bodies, while a boyish voice cried,--\n\n\"God save you, my lord!\"\n\nGlenarvan and Thalcave had scarcely time to perceive Robert, who,\nclinging to the horse's mane, disappeared in the darkness.\n\n\"Robert, unfortunate!\" cried Glenarvan.\n\nBut these words the Indian himself could not hear. Frightful howls\nresounded. The wolves, starting on the track of the horse, fled into\nthe darkness with a terrible speed.\n\nThalcave and Glenarvan rushed out of the ramada. Already the plain had\nresumed its tranquillity, and they could scarcely distinguish a moving\nline which undulated afar in the shadows of the night.\n\nGlenarvan sank upon the ground, overcome, in despair, clasping his\nhands. He gazed at Thalcave, who smiled with his accustomed calmness.\n\n\"Thaouka--good horse--brave child--he will be saved!\" he repeated,\nnodding his head.\n\n\"But if he falls?\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\"He will not fall!\"\n\nIn spite of Thalcave's confidence, his companion passed the night in\nterrible anguish. He was no longer even mindful of the danger still to\nbe feared from the wolves. He would have gone in search of Robert, but\nthe Indian restrained him, and explained that their horses could not\novertake the boy, that Thaouka must have distanced his enemies, and\ncould not be found in the darkness. They must wait for day to start in\nsearch of Robert.\n\nAt four o'clock in the morning day began to break. The mists of the\nhorizon were soon tinged with pale rays. A sparkling dew covered the\nplain, and the tall grass began to wave under the first breezes of the\ndawn.\n\nThe moment of departure had arrived.\n\n\"Forward!\" said the Indian.\n\nGlenarvan did not reply, but sprang upon Robert's horse, and the two\nwere soon galloping towards the west in the direction from which their\ncompanions were to come.\n\nFor an hour they traveled thus with great speed, gazing around for\nRobert, and dreading at each step to behold his mangled body. Glenarvan\ntortured the flanks of his horse with his spurs. Suddenly shots were\nheard, and reports at regular intervals, like signals for recognition.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"It is they!\" cried Glenarvan.\n\nThalcave and he urged their horses to a more rapid pace, and a few\nmoments afterwards they joined the party led by Paganel.\n\n[Sidenote: LIVELY GRATITUDE.]\n\nTo Glenarvan's joy, Robert was there, alive, borne by the noble\nThaouka, who neighed with pleasure at seeing his master.\n\n\"Ah, my boy! my boy!\" cried Glenarvan, with unspeakable tenderness; and\nRobert and he, dismounting, rushed into each other's arms.\n\nThen it was the Indian's turn to clasp to his breast the courageous son\nof Captain Grant.\n\n\"He lives! he lives!\" exclaimed Glenarvan.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Robert, \"thanks to Thaouka.\"\n\nThe Indian had not waited for these words of gratitude to embrace his\nhorse, but at that very moment he spoke to him and embraced him, as\nif human blood flowed in the veins of the noble animal.

He became Thalcave's\nshadow, and could not remain quiet in the presence of a real\nPatagonian, in comparison with whom he would have passed for a dwarf.\nHe overwhelmed the grave Indian with Spanish phrases, to which the\nlatter quietly listened. The geographer studied this time without a\nbook, and was often heard repeating words aloud.\n\n\"If I do not get the accent,\" said he to the major, \"you must not be\nangry with me.

The slope was gradual, and the travelers had only to descend\na gentle declivity to the sea.\n\nWhen the Patagonian declined the horse that Glenarvan offered him, the\nlatter thought that he preferred to go on foot, according to the custom\nof certain guides; and indeed, his long legs ought to have made walking\neasy. But he was mistaken.\n\nAt the moment of departure Thalcave whistled in a peculiar manner.\nImmediately a magnificent Argentine horse, of superb form, issued from\na small wood near by, and approached at the call of his master. The\nanimal was perfectly beautiful. His brown color indicated a sound,\nspirited and courageous beast. He had a small and elegantly poised\nhead, widely opening nostrils, a fiery eye, large hams, swelling\nwithers, broad breast, long pasterns, in short, all the qualities that\nconstitute strength and suppleness. The major, like a perfect horseman,\nadmired unreservedly this specimen of the horses of the plains. This\nbeautiful creature was called Thaouka, which means \"bird\" in the\nPatagonian language, and he justly merited this appellation.\n\n[Sidenote: A FRESH START.]\n\nWhen Thalcave was in the saddle, the horse pranced with spirited grace,\nand the Patagonian, a skillful rider, was magnificent to behold. His\noutfit comprised two weapons of the chase, the \"bolas\" and the lasso.\nThe bolas consists of three balls tied together by a leathern string,\nwhich are fastened to the front of the saddle. The Indians frequently\nthrow them the distance of a hundred paces at the animal or enemy that\nthey are pursuing, and with such precision that they twist about their\nlegs and bring them to the ground. It is, therefore, in their hands a\nformidable instrument, and they handle it with surprising dexterity.\nThe lasso, on the contrary, does not leave the hand that wields it. It\nconsists simply of a leathern thong thirty feet in length, terminating\nin a slip-noose which works upon an iron ring. The right hand throws\nthe slip-noose, while the left hand holds the remainder of the lasso,\nthe end of which is firmly tied to the saddle. A long carbine in a\nsling completed the Patagonian's armament.\n\nThalcave, without observing the admiration caused by his natural\ngrace, ease and courage, took the lead, and the party advanced, now\nat a gallop, and now at a walk, for their horses seemed entirely\nunaccustomed to trotting. Robert mounted with much boldness, and\nspeedily convinced Glenarvan of his ability to keep his seat.\n\nOn issuing from the gorges of the Andes, they encountered a great\nnumber of sand-ridges, called \"medanos,\" real waves incessantly\nagitated by the wind, when the roots of the herbage did not confine\nthem to the earth. This sand is of an extreme fineness; and, at the\nleast breath, they saw it float away in light clouds, or form regular\nsand-columns which rose to a considerable height. This spectacle caused\npleasure as well as annoyance to the eyes. Pleasure, for nothing was\nmore curious than these columns, wandering over the plain, struggling,\nmingling, sinking and rising in inexpressible confusion; and annoyance,\nsince an impalpable dust emanated from these innumerable medanos and\npenetrated the eyelids, however tightly they were closed.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThis phenomenon continued during a great part of the day.

A ponderous liquid mass engulfed them in its furious\ntide. When the deluge had passed, the men regained the surface, and\nrapidly counted their numbers; but the horses, except Thaouka, had\ndisappeared forever.\n\n\"Courage! courage!\" cried Glenarvan, who supported Paganel with one arm\nand swam with the other.\n\n\"All right! all right!\" replied the worthy geographer; \"indeed I am not\nsorry----\"\n\nWhat was he not sorry for? No one ever knew; for the poor man was\nforced to swallow the end of his sentence in half a pint of muddy water.\n\nThe major calmly advanced, taking a regular stroke of which the most\nskillful swimmer would not have been ashamed. The sailors worked their\nway along like porpoises in their native element. As for Robert, he\nclung to Thaouka's mane, and was thus drawn along. The horse proudly\ncut the waters, and kept himself instinctively on a line with the tree,\ntowards which the current bore him, and which was now not far distant.\n\nIn a few moments the entire party reached it. It was fortunate; for, if\nthis refuge had failed, all chance of safety would have vanished, and\nthey must have perished in the waves. The water was up to the top of\nthe trunk where the main branches grew, so that it was easy to grasp\nthem.\n\nThalcave, leaving his horse, and lifting Robert, seized the first limb,\nand soon his powerful arms had lodged the exhausted swimmers in a place\nof safety. But Thaouka, carried away by the current, was rapidly\ndisappearing. He turned his intelligent head towards his master, and,\nshaking his long mane, neighed for him beseechingly.\n\n[Illustration: A huge wave, forty feet high, overwhelmed the fugitives\nwith a terrible roar. Men and beasts, everything, disappeared in a\nwhirlpool of foam. A ponderous liquid mass engulfed them in its furious\ntide.]\n\n\"Do you abandon him?\" said Paganel.\n\n\"I?\" cried the Indian, and, plunging into the tempestuous waters, he\nreappeared some distance from the tree. A few moments after, his arm\nrested upon the neck of Thaouka, and horse and horseman swam away\ntogether towards the misty horizon of the north.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII.\n\nA SINGULAR ABODE.\n\n\nThe tree upon which Glenarvan and his companions had just found refuge\nresembled a walnut-tree. It had the same shining foliage and rounded\nform. It was the \"ombu,\" which is met with only on the Argentine\nPlains. It had an enormous, twisted trunk, and was confined to the\nearth not only by its great roots, but also by strong shoots which held\nit most tenaciously. It had thus resisted the force of the inundation.\n\n[Sidenote: AN ORNITHOLOGICAL OMNIUM-GATHERUM.]\n\nThis ombu measured one hundred feet in height, and might have covered\nwith its shade a circumference of three hundred and sixty feet. All\nthe upper part rested on three great branches, which forked from the\ntop of the trunk, that was six feet in diameter. Two of these branches\nwere nearly perpendicular, and supported the immense canopy of foliage,\nwhose crossed, twisted, and interlaced limbs, as if woven by the hand\nof a basket-maker, formed an impenetrable shelter. The third branch,\non the contrary, extended almost horizontally over the roaring waters;\nits leaves were bathed in them, while it seemed a promontory to this\nisland of verdure surrounded by an ocean. There was abundant space,\nalso, in the interior of this gigantic tree. The foliage, which was\nnot very dense at its outer circumference, left large openings like\nsky-lights, and made it well ventilated and cool. At sight of these\nbranches rising in innumerable ramifications towards the clouds, while\nthe parasitic convolvuli bound them to each other, and the rays of the\nsun shone through the interstices of the leaves, you would really have\nthought that the trunk of this ombu bore upon itself alone an entire\nforest.\n\nOn the arrival of the fugitives, a feathered population flew away to\nthe top branches, protesting by their cries against so flagran"}, {"chunk_id": 62, "text": "arvan, Robert, and Thalcave had yielded to the common law, and,\nstretched on their thick beds of grass, they enjoyed a refreshing\nsleep. The horses, overcome with fatigue, had lain down on the ground:\nThaouka alone, like a true blooded horse, slept standing, spirited in\nrepose as in action, and ready to start at the least sign from his\nmaster. Perfect tranquillity reigned within the inclosure, and the\nembers of the night-fire, as they gradually died out, cast their last\nrays over the silent obscurity.\n\nAbout ten o'clock, after a short sleep, the Indian awoke. His eyes\nbecame fixed beneath his lowered eyebrows, and his head was turned in a\nlistening attitude towards the plain. He seemed endeavoring to detect\nsome scarcely perceptible sound. A vague uneasiness was soon expressed\non his face, usually so calm. Had he perceived the approach of prowling\nIndians, or the coming of jaguars, water-tigers, and other formidable\nbeasts which are numerous in the neighborhood of rivers? This last\npossibility doubtless appeared plausible to him, for he cast a rapid\nglance over the combustible materials piled in the inclosure, and his\nanxiety increased. In fact, all this dry bedding would quickly be\nconsumed, and could not long intimidate the audacious animals.\n\nAccording to this conjecture, Thalcave had only to await the progress\nof events, which he did, half reclining, his head resting on his hands,\nhis elbows on his knees, his eyes motionless, in the attitude of a man\nwhom a sudden anxiety has awakened from sleep.\n\nAn hour passed. Any other person but Thalcave, reassured by the outward\nsilence, would have lain down again. But where a stranger would have\nsuspected nothing, the highly-trained senses and natural instinct of\nthe Indian foresaw the coming danger.\n\nWhile he was listening and watching, Thaouka gave a low neigh. His\nnose was stretched towards the entrance to the ramada. The Patagonian\nsuddenly started.\n\n\"Thaouka has scented some enemy,\" said he.\n\nHe arose and scanned the plain attentively. Silence still reigned, but\nnot tranquillity. Thalcave discerned shadows moving noiselessly among\nthe tufts of grass. Here and there glittered luminous points, which\nspread on all sides, now fading away, and now gleaming forth again. You\nwould have thought fantastic elves were dancing on the surface of an\nimmense lagoon. A stranger would doubtless have taken these flitting\nsparks for glow-worms, which shine, when night comes, in many parts of\nthe Pampas. But Thalcave was not deceived; he knew with what enemies he\nhad to deal. He loaded his carbine, and took a position near the first\nstakes of the inclosure.\n\nHe did not wait long. A strange cry, a mingling of barks and howls,\nresounded over the plain. The report of the carbine answered it,\nand was followed by a hundred frightful yelps. Glenarvan and Robert\nsuddenly awoke.\n\n[Sidenote: FEARFUL ODDS.]\n\n\"What is the matter?\" asked Robert.\n\n\"Indians?\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\"No,\" replied Thalcave, \"aguaras.\"\n\nRobert looked at Glenarvan.\n\n\"Aguaras?\" said he.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Glenarvan, \"the red wolves of the Pampas.\"\n\nBoth seized their weapons, and joined the Indian. The latter pointed\nto the plain, from which arose a series of formidable howls. Robert\ninvoluntarily took a step backward.\n\n\"You are not afraid of the wolves, my boy?\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\"No, my lord,\" replied Robert, in a firm tone. \"With you I fear\nnothing.\"\n\n\"So much the better. These aguaras are not very formidable beasts; and\nwere it not for their numbers I should not even think of them.\"\n\n\"What does it matter?\" replied Robert. \"We are well armed. Let them\ncome.\"\n\n\"And they shall be well received.\"\n\nSpeaking thus, Glenarvan endeavored to reassure the lad; but he did\nnot think without a secret terror of that dense horde of exasperated\nbeasts. Perhaps there were hundreds of them; and these three, however\nwell armed, could not advantageously contend against so many and such\nantagonists.\n\nBy the howls that resounded over the Pampas, and by the multi"}, {"chunk_id": 59, "text": "onfided to the\nsagacity of the geographer.\n\n[Sidenote: THE YOUNG SAILOR ON HORSEBACK.]\n\nThalcave was right in first proceeding towards the Guamini, since this\nstream lay on the prescribed course, and was the nearest. The three\nhorses galloped briskly forward. These excellent beasts perceived,\ndoubtless, by instinct, whither their masters were guiding them.\nThaouka, especially, showed a spirit that neither fatigue nor thirst\ncould overcome. The other horses followed, at a slower pace, but\nincited by his example.\n\nThe Patagonian frequently turned his head to look at Robert Grant, and,\nseeing the young boy firm and erect, in an easy and graceful position,\ntestified his satisfaction by a word of encouragement.\n\n\"Bravo, Robert!\" said Glenarvan. \"Thalcave seems to congratulate you.\nHe praises you, my boy!\"\n\n\"And why, my lord?\"\n\n\"Because of the way you ride.\"\n\n\"Oh, I merely keep firm; that is all,\" replied Robert, who blushed with\npleasure at hearing himself complimented.\n\n\"That is the main point, Robert,\" said Glenarvan; \"but you are too\nmodest, and I am sure you cannot fail to become an accomplished\nequestrian.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Robert, \"but what will papa say, who wishes to make a\nsailor of me?\"\n\n\"The one does not interfere with the other. If all horsemen do not make\ngood sailors, all sailors may certainly make good horsemen. To ride on\nthe yards, you must learn to keep yourself firm. As for knowing how to\nmanage your horse, that comes more easily.\"\n\n\"Poor father!\" exclaimed Robert; \"how he will thank you when you have\nfound him!\" And, so saying, he took his lordship's hand and pressed it\nto his lips.\n\n\"You love him well, Robert?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord; he was so kind to sister and me. He thought only of us,\nand every voyage brought us a memento of the countries he visited, and,\nwhat was better, tender caresses and kind words, on his return. Ah!\nyou will love him too, when you know him! Mary resembles him. He has a\nsweet voice like her. It is singular for a sailor, is it not?\"\n\n\"Yes, very singular, Robert,\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\"I see him still,\" replied the boy, as if speaking to himself. \"Good\nand brave papa! He rocked me to sleep on his knees, when I was little,\nand kept humming an old Scottish song which is sung around the lakes of\nour country. I sometimes recall the air, but indistinctly. How we loved\nhim, my lord! Well, I think one must be very young to love his father\nwell.\"\n\n\"And old to reverence him, my child,\" replied Glenarvan, quite moved by\nthe words that came from this young heart.\n\nDuring this conversation, their horses had relaxed their pace and\nfallen behind the other; but Thalcave called them, and they resumed\ntheir former gait. It was soon evident, however, that, with the\nexception of Thaouka, the horses could not long maintain this speed. At\nnoon it was necessary to give them an hour's rest.\n\nGlenarvan grew uneasy. The signs of dryness did not diminish, and the\nwant of water might result in disastrous consequences. Thalcave said\nnothing, but probably thought that if the Guamini was dry it would then\nbe time to despair, if indeed an Indian's heart has ever experienced\nsuch an emotion.\n\nThey therefore kept on, and by use of whip and spur the horses were\ninduced to continue their journey, but they could not quicken their\npace. Thalcave might easily have gone ahead, for in a few hours Thaouka\ncould have carried him to the banks of the stream. He doubtless thought\nof it, but probably did not like to leave his two companions alone in\nthe midst of this desert, and, that he might not outstrip them, he\nforced Thaouka to lessen his speed. It was not, however, without much\nresistance, prancing and neighing, that Thalcave's horse consented to\nkeep pace with the others. It was not so much the strength as the voice\nof his master which restrained him; the Indian actually talked to his\nhorse; and the animal, if he did not answer, at least comprehended\nhim.

He became Thalcave's\nshadow, and could not remain quiet in the presence of a real\nPatagonian, in comparison with whom he would have passed for a dwarf.\nHe overwhelmed the grave Indian with Spanish phrases, to which the\nlatter quietly listened. The geographer studied this time without a\nbook, and was often heard repeating words aloud.\n\n\"If I do not get the accent,\" said he to the major, \"you must not be\nangry with me. Who would have thought that one day a Patagonian would\nteach me Spanish!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\nNEWS OF THE LOST CAPTAIN.\n\n\nAt eight o'clock the next morning Thalcave gave the signal for\ndeparture. The slope was gradual, and the travelers had only to descend\na gentle declivity to the sea.\n\nWhen the Patagonian declined the horse that Glenarvan offered him, the\nlatter thought that he preferred to go on foot, according to the custom\nof certain guides; and indeed, his long legs ought to have made walking\neasy. But he was mistaken.\n\nAt the moment of departure Thalcave whistled in a peculiar manner.\nImmediately a magnificent Argentine horse, of superb form, issued from\na small wood near by, and approached at the call of his master. The\nanimal was perfectly beautiful. His brown color indicated a sound,\nspirited and courageous beast. He had a small and elegantly poised\nhead, widely opening nostrils, a fiery eye, large hams, swelling\nwithers, broad breast, long pasterns, in short, all the qualities that\nconstitute strength and suppleness. The major, like a perfect horseman,\nadmired unreservedly this specimen of the horses of the plains. This\nbeautiful creature was called Thaouka, which means \"bird\" in the\nPatagonian language, and he justly merited this appellation.\n\n[Sidenote: A FRESH START.]\n\nWhen Thalcave was in the saddle, the horse pranced with spirited grace,\nand the Patagonian, a skillful rider, was magnificent to behold. His\noutfit comprised two weapons of the chase, the \"bolas\" and the lasso.\nThe bolas consists of three balls tied together by a leathern string,\nwhich are fastened to the front of the saddle. The Indians frequently\nthrow them the distance of a hundred paces at the animal or enemy that\nthey are pursuing, and with such precision that they twist about their\nlegs and bring them to the ground. It is, therefore, in their hands a\nformidable instrument, and they handle it with surprising dexterity.\nThe lasso, on the contrary, does not leave the hand that wields it. It\nconsists simply of a leathern thong thirty feet in length, terminating\nin a slip-noose which works upon an iron ring. The right hand throws\nthe slip-noose, while the left hand holds the remainder of the lasso,\nthe end of which is firmly tied to the saddle. A long carbine in a\nsling completed the Patagonian's armament.\n\nThalcave, without observing the admiration caused by his natural\ngrace, ease and courage, took the lead, and the party advanced, now\nat a gallop, and now at a walk, for their horses seemed entirely\nunaccustomed to trotting. Robert mounted with much boldness, and\nspeedily convinced Glenarvan of his ability to keep his seat.\n\nOn issuing from the gorges of the Andes, they encountered a great\nnumber of sand-ridges, called \"medanos,\" real waves incessantly\nagitated by the wind, when the roots of the herbage did not confine\nthem to the earth. This sand is of an extreme fineness; and, at the\nleast breath, they saw it float away in light clouds, or form regular\nsand-columns which rose to a considerable height. This spectacle caused\npleasure as well as annoyance to the eyes. Pleasure, for nothing was\nmore curious than these columns, wandering over the plain, struggling,\nmingling, sinking and rising in inexpressible confusion; and annoyance,\nsince an impalpable dust emanated from these innumerable medanos and\npenetrated the eyelids, however tightly they were closed.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThis phenomenon continued during a great part of the day. Nevertheless,\nthey advanced rapidly, and towards six o'clock the A"}, {"chunk_id": 71, "text": "lighted! Welcome, welcome! I am almost a Frenchman,\"\ncried the commander, shaking the geographer's arm with rather painful\nviolence.\n\n\"One of your friends?\" asked the major of Paganel.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied he, with national pride; \"we have friends in all parts\nof the world!\"\n\n[Illustration: \"Ah, I am delighted! Welcome, welcome! I am almost a\nFrenchman,\" cried the commander, shaking the geographer's arm with\nrather painful violence.]\n\n[Sidenote: RAISING A REGIMENT.]\n\nHe then entered into conversation with the commander. Glenarvan would\ngladly have put in a word in regard to his affairs, but the soldier\nwas telling his story, and was not in the mood to be interrupted.\nThis honest man had left France a long time before; and the native\nlanguage was no longer perfectly familiar to him: he had forgotten,\nif not words, at least the manner of combining them. As his visitors\nsoon learned, he had been a sergeant in the French army. Since the\nfoundation of the fort he had not left it, and commanded it by\nappointment from the Argentine government. He was by parentage a\nBasque, and his name was Manuel Ipharaguerre. A year after his arrival\nin the country, Sergeant Manuel was naturalized, joined the Argentine\narmy, and married an honest Indian woman, who had twins,--boys, to be\nsure, for the sergeant's worthy consort would never present him with\ndaughters. Manuel did not think of any other calling than that of the\nsoldier, and hoped, in time, with the help of God, to offer to the\nrepublic a whole battalion of young soldiers.\n\n\"You have seen them?\" said he. \"Charming fellows! Good soldiers! José!\nJuan! Miguel! Pepe! Pepe is only seven years old, and is already biting\nhis cartridge!\"\n\nPepe, hearing himself complimented, joined his two little feet, and\npresented arms with perfect precision.\n\n\"He will do!\" added the sergeant. \"He will be a major--or\nbrigadier-general one day!\"\n\nThis story lasted a quarter of an hour, to Thalcave's great\nastonishment. The Indian could not understand how so many words could\ncome from a single throat. No one interrupted the commander; and even\na French sergeant had to conclude at last, though not without forcing\nhis guests to accompany him to his dwelling. Here they were introduced\nto Madame Ipharaguerre, who appeared to be \"a good-looking person,\" if\nthis expression may be employed in regard to an Indian.\n\nWhen he had exhausted himself, the sergeant asked his guests to what he\nowed the honor of their visit. And now it was their turn to explain.\n\nPaganel, opening the conversation in French, told him of their journey\nacross the Pampas, and ended by asking why the Indians had abandoned\nthe country.\n\n\"War!\" replied the sergeant.\n\n\"War?\"\n\n\"Yes, civil war.\"\n\n\"Civil war?\" rejoined Paganel.\n\n\"Yes, war between Paraguay and Buenos Ayres,\" answered the sergeant.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Why, all the Indians of the north are in the rear of General Flores,\nand those of the plains are plundering.\"\n\n\"But the caziques?\"\n\n\"The caziques with them.\"\n\nThis answer was reported to Thalcave, who shook his head. Indeed,\nhe either did not know, or had forgotten, that a civil war, which\nwas afterwards to involve Brazil, was decimating two-thirds of the\nrepublic. The Indians had everything to gain in these internal\nstruggles, and could not neglect such fine opportunities for plunder.\nThe sergeant, therefore, was not mistaken in attributing this desertion\nof the Pampas to the civil war that was being waged in the northern\npart of the Argentine Provinces.\n\nBut this event disconcerted Glenarvan's hopes. If Captain Grant was\na prisoner of the caziques, he must have been carried by them to the\nnorthern frontiers. Yet how and where to find him? Must they attempt\na perilous and almost useless search to the northern limits of the\nPampas? It was a serious matter, which was to be earnestly considered.\n\nHowever, one important question was still to be asked of the sergeant,\nand the major thought of this, while his companions were looking at\neach other in silence.\n\n\"Hav"}, {"chunk_id": 54, "text": "nd, wishing to save\nhis reputation, had begun with renewed energy his geographical\ndemonstrations, when the Patagonian stopped him with a gesture.\n\n\"You are searching for a prisoner?\" he said.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Paganel.\n\n\"And exactly on the line from the setting to the rising sun?\" said\nThalcave, indicating by a comparison, in the Indian manner, the course\nfrom west to east.\n\n\"Yes, yes, that is it!\"\n\n\"And it is your God,\" said the Patagonian, \"who has confided to the\nwaves of the vast ocean the secrets of the prisoner?\"\n\n\"God himself.\"\n\n\"May his will be accomplished then!\" replied Thalcave, with a certain\nsolemnity. \"We will go to the east, and, if necessary, even to the sun.\"\n\nPaganel, in his exultation over his pupil, immediately translated to\nhis companions the replies of the Indian.\n\nGlenarvan requested Paganel to ask the Patagonian if he had heard\nof any strangers falling into the hands of the Indians, which was\naccordingly done.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" replied the Patagonian.\n\nAs soon as this word was translated, Thalcave was surrounded by the\nseven travelers, who gazed at him with questioning looks. Paganel,\nexcited and scarcely finding his words, resumed these interesting\ninterrogatories, while his eyes, fixed upon the grave Indian, strove\nto anticipate his reply before it issued from his lips. Every word the\nPatagonian said he repeated in English, so that his companions heard\nthe Indian speak, as it were, in their own language.\n\n\"And this prisoner?\" inquired Paganel.\n\n\"He was a stranger,\" replied Thalcave slowly; \"a European.\"\n\n\"You have seen him?\"\n\n\"No, but he is mentioned in the accounts of the Indians. He was a brave\nman.\"\n\n\"You understand, my friends,\" said Paganel; \"a courageous man!\"\n\n\"My father!\" cried Robert Grant.\n\nThen, addressing Paganel:\n\n\"How do you say 'It is my father,' in Spanish?\" he asked.\n\n\"_Es mio padre_,\" answered the geographer.\n\nImmediately Robert, taking Thalcave's hands, said in a sweet voice,--\n\n\"_Es mio padre!_\"\n\n\"_Suo padre!_\" replied the Patagonian, whose look brightened.\n\nHe took the boy in his arms, lifted him from his horse, and gazed at\nhim with the most curious sympathy. His intelligent countenance became\nsuffused with a peaceful emotion.\n\nBut Paganel had not finished his inquiries. Where was this prisoner?\nWhat was he doing? When had Thalcave heard of him? All these questions\nthronged his mind at once. He did not have to wait long for answers,\nbut learnt that the European was a slave of one of the Indian tribes\nthat scour the plains.\n\n\"But where was he last?\" asked Paganel.\n\n\"With the cazique Calfoucoura,\" answered Thalcave.\n\n\"On the line we have been following?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And who is this cazique?\"\n\n\"The chief of the Poyuches Indians; a man with two tongues and two\nhearts.\"\n\n[Sidenote: A SCIENTIFIC BATH.]\n\n\"That is to say, false in word and in deed,\" said Paganel, after\ntranslating to his companions this beautiful metaphor of the Indian\nlanguage. \"And can we rescue our friend?\" he added.\n\n\"Perhaps so, if your friend is still in the hands of the Indians.\"\n\n\"And when did you hear of him?\"\n\n\"A long time ago, and, since then, the sun has brought back two summers\nto the sky.\"\n\nGlenarvan's joy could not be described. This answer coincided exactly\nwith the date of the document. But one question remained to be asked.\n\n\"You speak of a prisoner,\" said Paganel; \"but were there not three?\"\n\n\"I do not know,\" replied Thalcave.\n\n\"And you know nothing of their actual situation?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\nThis last word ended the conversation. It was possible that the three\nprisoners had been separated a long time. But the substance of the\nPatagonian's information was that the Indians spoke of a European who\nhad fallen into their power. The date of his captivity, the place where\nhe must have been, everything, even to the Patagonian phrase used to\nexpress his courage, related evidently to Captain Harry Grant.\n\nTheir progress was now somewhat slow and difficult; their next object\nbeing to reach and cross the river Colorado, to w"}, {"chunk_id": 48, "text": "ors with which he painted\nhis face. His leggings were of ox-hide, and fastened to the ankle with\nstraps regularly crossed.\n\nThe figure of this Patagonian was fine, and his face denoted real\nintelligence in spite of the colors that adorned (!) it. He waited in\nan attitude full of dignity, and, seeing him so motionless and stern on\nhis pedestal of rocks, you would have taken him for a statue.\n\nThe major, as soon as he perceived him, pointed him out to Glenarvan,\nwho hastened towards him. The Patagonian took two steps forward;\nGlenarvan took his hand, and pressed it. There was in the latter's\nlook, in his physiognomy, such a feeling, such an expression of\ngratitude, that the native could not mistake it. He inclined his head\ngently, and uttered a few words that neither the major nor his friend\ncould understand.\n\nThe Patagonian, after regarding the strangers attentively, now changed\nthe language; but whatever it was, this new idiom was no better\nunderstood than the first. However, certain expressions which he used\nstruck Glenarvan. They seemed to belong to the Spanish language, of\nwhich he knew several common words.\n\n\"Spanish?\" said he.\n\nThe Patagonian nodded.\n\n\"Well,\" said the major, \"this is our friend Paganel's business. It is\nfortunate that he thought of learning Spanish.\"\n\nPaganel was called. He came at once and with all the grace of a\nFrenchman saluted the Patagonian, to which the latter paid no\nattention. The geographer was informed of the state of affairs, and was\nonly too glad to use his diligently-acquired knowledge.\n\n[Sidenote: SOMETHING WRONG.]\n\n\"Exactly,\" said he. And opening his mouth widely in order to articulate\nbetter, he said, in his best Spanish,--\n\n\"You--are--a--brave--man.\"\n\nThe native listened, but did not answer.\n\n\"He does not understand,\" said the geographer.\n\n\"Perhaps you do not pronounce well,\" replied the major.\n\n\"Very true! Curse the pronunciation!\"\n\nAnd again Paganel began, but with no better success.\n\n\"I will change the expression,\" said he. And pronouncing with\nmagisterial slowness, he uttered these words,--\n\n\"A--Patagonian,--doubtless?\"\n\nThe native remained mute as before.\n\n\"Answer!\" added Paganel.\n\nThe Patagonian did not reply.\n\n\"Do--you--understand?\" cried Paganel, violently enough to damage his\norgans of speech.\n\nIt was evident that the Indian did not understand, for he answered, but\nin Spanish,--\n\n\"I do not understand.\"\n\nIt was Paganel's turn now to be astonished, and he hastily put on his\nglasses, like one irritated.\n\n\"May I be hanged,\" said he, \"if I understand a word of this infernal\njargon! It is certainly Araucanian.\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Glenarvan; \"this man answered in Spanish.\"\n\nAnd, turning to the Patagonian, he repeated,--\n\n\"Spanish?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the native.\n\nPaganel's surprise became amazement. The major and Glenarvan looked at\nhim quizzingly.\n\n\"Ah, my learned friend!\" said the major, while a half smile played\nabout his lips, \"you have committed one of those blunders peculiar to\nyou.\"\n\n\"What!\" cried the geographer, starting.\n\n\"Yes, it is plain that this Patagonian speaks Spanish.\"\n\n\"He?\"\n\n[Illustration: A man of lofty stature was standing, motionless, on\none of the first ledges of the mountain.

The catapaz was questioned on this subject.\n\n\"I know,\" he replied, \"of but two passes that are practicable in this\npart of the Andes.\"\n\n\"Doubtless the pass of Arica,\" said Paganel, \"which was discovered by\nValdivia Mendoza.\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\n\"And that of Villarica, situated to the south of Nevado.\"\n\n\"You are right.\"\n\n\"Well, my friend, these two passes have only one difficulty; they will\ncarry us to the south, or the north, farther than we wish.\"\n\n\"Have you another pass to propose?\" asked the major.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Paganel; \"the pass of Antuco.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Glenarvan; \"but do you know this pass, catapaz?\"\n\n[Sidenote: ATTAINING TO EMINENCE.]\n\n\"Yes, my lord, I have crossed it, and did not propose it because it is\nonly a cattle-track for the Indian herdsmen of the eastern slopes.\"\n\n\"Never mind, my friend,\" continued Glenarvan; \"where the herds of the\nIndians pass, we can also; and, since this will keep us in our course,\nlet us start for the pass of Antuco.\"\n\nThe signal for departure was immediately given, and they entered the\nvalley of Los Lejos between great masses of crystalized limestone, and\nascended a very gradual slope. Towards noon they had to pass around\nthe shores of a small lake, the picturesque reservoir of all the\nneighboring streams which flowed into it.\n\nAbove the lake extended vast \"llanos,\" lofty plains, covered with\ngrass, where the herds of the Indians grazed. Then they came upon a\nswamp which extended to the south and north, but which the instinct\nof the mules enabled them to avoid. Soon Fort Ballenare appeared on a\nrocky peak which it crowned with its dismantled walls. The ascent had\nalready become abrupt and stony, and the pebbles, loosened by the hoofs\nof the mules, rolled under their feet in a rattling torrent.\n\nThe road now became difficult, and even perilous. The steepness\nincreased, the walls on either side approached each other more and\nmore, while the precipices yawned frightfully. The mules advanced\ncautiously in single file, with their noses to the ground, scenting the\nway.\n\nNow and then, at a sudden turn, the madrina disappeared, and the little\ncaravan was then guided by the distant tinkling of her bell. Sometimes,\ntoo, the capricious windings of the path would bend the column into\ntwo parallel lines, and the catapaz could talk to the peons, while a\ncrevasse, scarcely two fathoms wide, but two hundred deep, formed an\nimpassable abyss between them.\n\nUnder these conditions it was difficult to distinguish the course. The\nalmost incessant action of subterranean and volcanic agency changes\nthe road, and the landmarks are never the same. Therefore the catapaz\nhesitated, stopped, looked about him, examined the form of the rocks,\nand searched on the crumbling stones for the tracks of Indians.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nGlenarvan followed in the steps of his guide. He perceived, he _felt_,\nhis embarrassment, increasing with the difficulties of the way. He did\nnot dare to question him, but thought that it was better to trust to\nthe instinct of the muleteers and mules.\n\nFor an hour longer the catapaz wandered at a venture, but always\nseeking the more elevated parts of the mountain.

He came out of his examination very creditably; the\nreverence with which he spoke of the Creator and of the Bible produced\na very favorable impression on the Scottish heads of the expedition,\nwhilst the fact that he had taken \"the first prize in geography\" was\nsufficient introduction to Monsieur Paganel, who forthwith tested his\nknowledge, greatly to his own satisfaction, and considerably to the\ncredit of his young pupil. The curiosity of his discoverers having been\nfully satisfied, Toliné was made welcome, and partook with the others\nof the general repast. Many were the plans and purposes concerning\nhim, and much wonder was expressed as to how they could speed him on\nhis way; but in the morning it was discovered that he had solved the\nproblem for himself, and a bouquet of fresh leaves and flowers, laid by\nthe side of Lady Helena's seat, was the only memento that Toliné had\nleft.\n\n[Sidenote: A GOLDEN CITY.]\n\nThe party were now approaching the district which, in the years 1851\nand 1852, was so much talked of throughout the civilized world,\nand attracted from all parts so many reckless adventurers and\nfortune-hunters. The line of the thirty-seventh parallel, on which they\nwere traveling, led them through the diggings and municipality of Mount\nAlexander, which was one of the most successful spots for the digger at\nthe commencement of the gold fever, in consequence of the comparatively\nlevel nature of the ground and the general richness of the soil, so\ndifferent from some other localities where only once in a while was\nsome enormous nugget to be found. As they drew near to the streets of\nthis hastily-built town, Ayrton and Mulready, who were in charge of the\ncart, were sent forward, whilst the others walked through the place to\ninspect what there might be of interest, as well as to ascertain what\nmight be learned concerning the object of their expedition.\n\nThus, in this strange gathering of all nationalities and creeds and\nprofessions, the regular inhabitants beheld a still more extraordinary\nsight than that every day afforded them: folks who to the refinement\nwhich education and civilization give added both the earnestness\nof the worker and the freshness and vigor of the pleasure-seeking\ntourist. In the streets, in connection with the strange sign-boards and\nannouncements, the novel erections and purposes to which some of them\nwere adapted, Paganel had a history and commentary for every one.\n\nStill more did he expatiate upon the thousand-and-one topics of\ninterest when they visited the bank building, which here is the\ncentre of more than one agency connected with this great gold-bearing\ndistrict. Here was the mineralogical museum, in which might be seen\nspecimens illustrative of all the various ways in which the gold has\nbeen found, whether in combination with clay or other minerals, or--as\nit is sometimes, to the great joy of the finder, discovered--_pur\net simple_. Here also were models, diagrams, and even the tools\nthemselves, to illustrate the different methods by which the object\nof search was dug out, or washed, or crushed, or tested. Here also\nwas an almost unequaled collection of precious stones, gems of all\nsorts, making the gallery in which they were placed a real Golconda\nfor its wealth and attractions. Besides all this, here was the centre\nof the varied agencies by which the reports were brought in from the\ncompanies established for mining purposes, and also from each isolated\nworker, of the space purchased, the number of feet or yards dug, the\nore extracted, the comparative richness or poverty of the soil here,\nthere, and elsewhere, which in their summarized and aggregate form have\ngreatly helped to a correct knowledge of the comparative and absolute\ngold-"}, {"chunk_id": 236, "text": "he plan of founding a Scottish\ncolony on the shores washed by the Pacific Ocean.\n\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK 46597 ***\n"}, {"chunk_id": 27, "text": "van.\n\n\"My lord, you are a tempter.\"\n\n\"I add that we shall visit Port Famine.\"\n\n\"Port Famine!\" cried the Frenchman, assailed on all sides; \"that port\nso celebrated in geographical fasts!\"\n\n\"Consider also, Monsieur Paganel,\" continued Lady Helena, \"that in this\nenterprise you will have the right to associate the name of France with\nthat of Scotland.\"\n\n\"Yes; doubtless.\"\n\n\"A geographer may be very serviceable to our expedition; and what is\nmore noble than for science to enlist in the service of humanity?\"\n\n\"That is well said, madam.\"\n\n\"Believe me, try chance, or rather Providence.

The worthy geographer almost fell backwards. \"A rough little\ngentleman,\" said he; \"I will teach him geography.\" As Captain Mangles\nhad engaged to make him a sailor, Glenarvan a man of honor, the major a\nboy of coolness, Lady Helena a noble and generous being, and Mary Grant\na pupil grateful towards such patrons, Robert was evidently to become\none day an accomplished gentleman.\n\nThe Duncan soon finished shipping her coal, and then leaving these\ngloomy regions she gained the current from the southeast coast of\nBrazil, and, after crossing the equator with a fine breeze from the\nnorth, she entered the southern hemisphere. The passage was effected\nwithout difficulty, and every one had good hopes. On this voyage in\nsearch of Captain Grant, the probabilities increased every day. Their\ncaptain was one of the most confident on board; but his confidence\nproceeded especially from the desire that he cherished so strongly at\nheart, of seeing Miss Mary happy and consoled. He was particularly\ninterested in this young girl; and this feeling he concealed so well,\nthat, except Miss Grant and himself, no one on board the Duncan had\nperceived it.\n\nAs for the learned geographer, he was probably the happiest man in the\nsouthern hemisphere. He passed his time in studying the maps with which\nhe covered the cabin-table; and then followed daily discussions with\nMr. Olbinett, so that he could scarcely set the table.\n\nBut Paganel had all the passengers on his side except the major,\nwho was very indifferent to geographical questions, especially at\ndinner-time. Having discovered a whole cargo of odd books in the mate's\nchests, and among them a number of Cervantes' works, the Frenchman\nresolved to learn Spanish, which nobody on board knew, and which would\nfacilitate his search on the shores of Chili. Thanks to his love for\nphilology, he did not despair of speaking this new tongue fluently on\narriving at Concepcion. He therefore studied assiduously, and was heard\nincessantly muttering heterogeneous syllables. During his leisure hours\nhe did not fail to give young Robert practical instruction, and taught\nhim the history of the country they were rapidly approaching.\n\nIn the meantime the Duncan was proceeding at a remarkable rate. She\ncut the Tropic of Capricorn, and her prow was headed toward the strait\nof the celebrated geographer. Now and then the low shores of Patagonia\nwere seen, but like an almost invisible line on the horizon. They\nsailed along the coast for more than ten miles, but Paganel's famous\ntelescope gave him only a vague idea of these American shores.\n\nThe vessel soon found herself at the head of the "}, {"chunk_id": 101, "text": "n they resumed their course, though many miles were before them,\nthere was a growing sense of anticipation; they were not to pause again\nuntil the \"Australian continent\" was reached; and more and more did\nthe conversation and discussions tend towards this continent as their\nsubject. On one occasion so certain was Paganel as to the ease with\nwhich they would be able to pursue their search, when they arrived,\nthat he asserted that more than fifty geographers had already made the\ncourse clear for them.\n\n\"What! fifty, do you say?\" asked the major, with an air of doubt.\n\n\"Yes, MacNabb, decidedly,\" said the geographer, piqued at the hesitancy\nto believe him.\n\n\"Impossible!\" replied the major.\n\n\"Not at all; and if you doubt my veracity, I will cite their names.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said the major, quietly, \"you clever people stick at nothing.\"\n\n\"Major,\" said Paganel, \"will you wager your rifle against my telescope\nthat I cannot name at least fifty Australian explorers?\"\n\n\"Of course, Paganel, if you like,\" replied MacNabb, seeing that he\ncould not now recede from his position without incurring the ridicule\nof the company.\n\n[Illustration: \"Major,\" said Paganel, \"will you wager your rifle\nagainst my telescope that I cannot name at least fifty Australian\nexplorers?\"]\n\n[Illustration: \"Master Robert shall count for us.\" And forthwith the\nlearned geographer opened his budget, and poured forth the history of\nthe discovery of Australia.]\n\n\"Well, then,\" said Paganel to Lady Helena and Miss Grant, \"come and\nbe umpires, and Master Robert shall count for us.\" And forthwith the\nlearned geographer opened his budget, and poured forth the history of\nthe discovery of Australia, with the names of its discoverers and the\ndates of their explorations, as fluently as though his sole calling in\nlife was to be professor of Australian history. Rapidly he mentioned\nthe first twenty who found or traversed the Austral shores; as rapidly\ndid the names of the second score flow from his lips; and after the\nprescribed fifty had been enumerated, he kept on as though his list\nwere inexhaustible.\n\n\"Enough, enough, Monsieur Paganel!\" said Lady Helena. \"You have shown\nthat there is nothing, great or small, about Australia, of which you\nare ignorant.\"\n\n\"Nay, madam,\" said the geographer, with a bow.\n\nThen, with a peculiar expression, he smiled as he said to the major,\n\"We will talk about the rifle at another time.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX.\n\nTHE STORM ON THE INDIAN OCEAN.\n\n\nTwo days after this conversation, Captain Mangles took an observation,\nand the passengers saw, to their great satisfaction, upon consulting\nthe map, that they were in the vicinity of Cape Bernouilli, which\nthey might expect to reach in four days. The west wind had hitherto\nfavored the progress of the yacht, but for several days it had shown a\ntendency to fail, and now there was a perfect calm. The sails flapped\nidly against the masts, and had it not been for her powerful screw, the\nDuncan would have been becalmed on the ocean.\n\n[Sidenote: FOREBODINGS OF DISASTER.]\n\nThis state of things might be prolonged indefinitely. At evening\nGlenarvan consulted the captain on the subject. The latter, whose\nsupply of coal was rapidly diminishing, appeared much disturbed at the\nsubsidence of the wind. He had covered his ship with canvas, and set\nhis studding- and main-sails, that he might take advantage of the least\nbreeze; but, in nautical language, there was not enough wind \"to fill a\nhat.\"\n\n\"At all events,\" said Glenarvan, \"we need not complain.

We are now in the neighborhood of the\ntrade-winds, which, from October to April, blow from the northeast, and\nour progress will, therefore, be very much retarded.\"\n\n\"But what can we do, captain?

The captain replied that it would be\nimpossible with such a rude craft.\n\n\"And could we have done with the boat what we cannot do with the raft?\"\n\n\"Yes, candidly speaking, we could,\" was the reply; \"but with the\nnecessity of sailing by day and anchoring by night.\"\n\n[Sidenote: A FRENCHMAN'S FOIBLE.]\n\n\"Then these wretches, who have abandoned us----\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Captain Mangles, \"they were drunk, and in the profound\ndarkness I fear they have paid for their cowardly desertion with their\nlives.\"\n\n\"So much the worse for them,\" continued Paganel; \"and for us, too, as\nthis boat would have been useful.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, Paganel?\" said Glenarvan. \"The raft will take us\nashore.\"\n\n\"That is precisely what I would avoid,\" replied the geographer.\n\n\"What! can a journey of not more than twenty miles terrify us, after\nwhat has been done on the Pampas and in Australia?\"\n\n\"My friends,\" resumed Paganel, \"I do not doubt your courage, nor that\nof our fair companions.

Besides, an attack from a few wretches cannot intimidate ten\nwell-armed and determined Europeans.\"\n\n\"It is not a question of wretches,\" rejoined Paganel. \"The New\nZealanders form terrible tribes that struggle against the English\ngovernment, fight with invaders, frequently conquer them, and always\neat them.\"\n\n\"Cannibals! cannibals!\" cried Robert; and then he murmured, as though\nafraid to give full utterance to the words, \"My sister!

Not long since, in the year 1864, one of these clergymen\nwas seized by the chiefs, was hung to the tree, was tantalized and\ntortured to his last moments; and then, whilst some tore his body to\npieces, others devoured the various members. No, the Maoris are still\ncannibals, and will remain so for some time to come.\"\n\nBut Paganel was on this point a pessimist, contrary to his usual\ncharacteristic.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVII.\n\nA DREADED COUNTRY.\n\n\nWhat Paganel had stated was indisputable. The cruelty of the New\nZealanders could not be doubted. There was, therefore, danger in\nlanding. But if the danger had been a hundred times greater, it must\nhave been faced. Captain Mangles felt the necessity of leaving this\nvessel, which would soon break up. Between two perils, one certain, the\nother only probable, there was no possible hesitation.\n\n[Sidenote: ANOTHER CHANGE OF RESIDENCE.]\n\nAs for the chance "}, {"chunk_id": 37, "text": "prescribed\ncourse? The catapaz was questioned on this subject.\n\n\"I know,\" he replied, \"of but two passes that are practicable in this\npart of the Andes.\"\n\n\"Doubtless the pass of Arica,\" said Paganel, \"which was discovered by\nValdivia Mendoza.\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\n\"And that of Villarica, situated to the south of Nevado.\"\n\n\"You are right.\"\n\n\"Well, my friend, these two passes have only one difficulty; they will\ncarry us to the south, or the north, farther than we wish.\"\n\n\"Have you another pass to propose?\" asked the major.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Paganel; \"the pass of Antuco.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Glenarvan; \"but do you know this pass, catapaz?\"\n\n[Sidenote: ATTAINING TO EMINENCE.]\n\n\"Yes, my lord, I have crossed it, and did not propose it because it is\nonly a cattle-track for the Indian herdsmen of the eastern slopes.\"\n\n\"Never mind, my friend,\" continued Glenarvan; \"where the herds of the\nIndians pass, we can also; and, since this will keep us in our course,\nlet us start for the pass of Antuco.\"\n\nThe signal for departure was immediately given, and they entered the\nvalley of Los Lejos between great masses of crystalized limestone, and\nascended a very gradual slope. Towards noon they had to pass around\nthe shores of a small lake, the picturesque reservoir of all the\nneighboring streams which flowed into it.\n\nAbove the lake extended vast \"llanos,\" lofty plains, covered with\ngrass, where the herds of the Indians grazed. Then they came upon a\nswamp which extended to the south and north, but which the instinct\nof the mules enabled them to avoid. Soon Fort Ballenare appeared on a\nrocky peak which it crowned with its dismantled walls. The ascent had\nalready become abrupt and stony, and the pebbles, loosened by the hoofs\nof the mules, rolled under their feet in a rattling torrent.\n\nThe road now became difficult, and even perilous. The steepness\nincreased, the walls on either side approached each other more and\nmore, while the precipices yawned frightfully. The mules advanced\ncautiously in single file, with their noses to the ground, scenting the\nway.\n\nNow and then, at a sudden turn, the madrina disappeared, and the little\ncaravan was then guided by the distant tinkling of her bell. Sometimes,\ntoo, the capricious windings of the path would bend the column into\ntwo parallel lines, and the catapaz could talk to the peons, while a\ncrevasse, scarcely two fathoms wide, but two hundred deep, formed an\nimpassable abyss between them.\n\nUnder these conditions it was difficult to distinguish the course. The\nalmost incessant action of subterranean and volcanic agency changes\nthe road, and the landmarks are never the same. Therefore the catapaz\nhesitated, stopped, looked about him, examined the form of the rocks,\nand searched on the crumbling stones for the tracks of Indians.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nGlenarvan followed in the steps of his guide. He perceived, he _felt_,\nhis embarrassment, increasing with the difficulties of the way. He did\nnot dare to question him, but thought that it was better to trust to\nthe instinct of the muleteers and mules.\n\nFor an hour longer the catapaz wandered at a venture, but always\nseeking the more elevated parts of the mountain. At last he was forced\nto stop short. They were at the bottom of a narrow valley,--one of\nthose ravines that the Indians call \"quebradas.\" A perpendicular wall\nof porphyry barred their exit.\n\n[Sidenote: CLIMBING A MOUNTAIN.]\n\nThe catapaz, after searching vainly for a passage, dismounted, folded\nhis arms, and waited. Glenarvan approached him.\n\n\"Have you lost your way?\" he asked.\n\n\"No, my lord,\" replied the catapaz.\n\n\"But we are not at the pass of Antuco?\"\n\n\"We are.\"\n\n\"Are you not mistaken?\"\n\n\"I am not.

Lady Helena was the first to\nresume the conversation.\n\n\"What an idea!\" she exclaimed.\n\n\"What a _good_ idea!\" added the geographer, simply.\n\n\"Your advice then?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"My advice is to find the thirty-seventh parallel, just where it meets\nthe American coast, and follow it, without deviating half a degree, to\nthe point where it strikes the Atlantic. Perhaps we shall find on its\ncourse the survivors of the Britannia.\"\n\n\"A feeble chance,\" replied the major.\n\n\"However feeble it may be,\" continued Paganel, \"we ought not to neglect\nit. If I am right that this bottle reached the sea by following the\ncurrent of a river, we cannot fail to come upon the traces of the\nprisoners. Look, my friends, look at the map of this country, and I\nwill convince you beyond a doubt.\"\n\n[Sidenote: NIL DESPERANDUM!]\n\nSo saying, Paganel spread out before them upon the table a large map of\nChili and the Argentine Provinces. \"Look,\" said he, \"and follow me in\nthis passage across the American continent. Let us pass over the narrow\nstrip of Chili and the Cordilleras of the Andes, and descend into the\nmidst of the Pampas. Are rivers, streams, water-courses, wanting in\nthese regions? No. Here are the Rio Negro, the Rio Colorado, and their\naffluents, cut by the thirty-seventh parallel, all of which might have\nserved to transport the document. There, perhaps, in the midst of a\ntribe, in the hands of settled Indians, on the shores of these unknown\nrivers, in the gorges of the sierras, those whom I have the right to\ncall our friends are awaiting an interposition of Providence. Ought\nwe, then, to disappoint their hopes? Do you not think we should follow\nacross these countries an unswerving course? And if, contrary to all\nexpectation, I am still mistaken, is it not our duty to trace this\nparallel to the very end, and, if necessary, make upon it the tour of\nthe world?\"\n\nThese words, spoken with a noble enthusiasm, excited a deep emotion\namong Paganel's hearers. All rose to shake hands with him.\n\n\"Yes, my father is there!\" cried Robert Grant, devouring the map with\nhis eyes.\n\n\"And wherever he is,\" replied Glenarvan, \"we shall find him, my child.\nNothing is more consistent than our friend Paganel's interpretation,\nand we must follow without hesitation the course he has indicated.\nEither Captain Grant is in the hands of countless Indians, or is\nprisoner in a feeble tribe.

Far out in the sea sported\ndroves of seals and whales of great size, judging by their spouting,\nwhich could be seen at a distance of four miles. At last they doubled\nCape Froward, still bristling with the ices of winter. On the other\nside of the strait, on Terra del Fuego, rose Mount Sarmiento to the\nheight of six thousand feet, an enormous mass of rock broken by bands\nof clouds which formed as it were an aerial archipelago in the sky.\n\n[Illustration: Port Famine.]\n\nCape Froward is the real end of the American continent, for Cape Horn\nis only a lone rock in the sea. Passing this point the strait narrowed\nbetween Brunswick Peninsula, and Desolation Island. Then to fertile\nshores succeeded a line of wild barren coast, cut by a thousand inlets\nof this tortuous labyrinth.\n\nThe Duncan unerringly and unhesitatingly pursued its capricious\nwindings, mingling her columns of smoke with the mists on the rocks.\nWithout lessening her speed, she passed several Spanish factories\nestablished on these deserted shores. At Cape Tamar the strait widened.\nThe yacht rounded the Narborough Islands, and approached the southern\nshores. At last, thirty-six hours after entering the strait, the rocks\nof Cape Pilares were discerned at the extreme point of Desolation\nIsland. An immense open glittering sea extended before her prow, and\nJacques Paganel, hailing it with an enthusiastic gesture, felt moved\nlike Ferdinand Magellan himself, when the sails of the Trinidad swelled\nbefore the breezes of the Pacific.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\nTHE COURSE DECIDED.\n\n\nEight days after doubling Cape Pilares the Duncan entered at full speed\nthe Bay of Talcahuana, a magnificent estuary, twelve miles long and\nnine broad. The weather was beautiful. Not a cloud is seen in the sky\nof this country from November to March, and the wind from the south\nblows continually along these coasts, which are protected by the chain\nof the Andes.\n\nCaptain Mangles, according to Lord Glenarvan's orders, had kept close\nto the shore of the continent, examining the numerous wrecks that lined\nit. A waif, a broken spar, a piece of wood fashioned by the hand of\nman, might guide the Duncan to the scene of the shipwreck. But nothing\nwas seen, and the yacht continued her course and anchored in the harbor\nof Talcahuana forty-two days after her departure from the waters of the\nClyde.\n\n[Sidenote: LEARNING SPANISH!]\n\nGlenarvan at once lowered the boat, and, followed by Paganel, landed\nat the foot of the palisade. The learned geographer, profiting by the\ncircumstance, would have made use of the language which he had studied\nso conscientiously; but, to his great astonishment, he could not make\nhimself understood by the natives.\n\n\"The accent is what I need,\" said he.\n\n\"Let us go to the Custom-house,\" replied Glenarvan.\n\nThere they were informed by means of several English words, accompanied\nby expressive gestures, that the British consul resided at Concepcion.\nIt was only an hour's journey. Glenarvan easily found two good horses,\nand, a short time after, Paganel and he entered the walls of this great\ncity, which was built by the enterprising genius of Valdivia, the\nvaliant companion of Pizarro.\n\nHow greatly it had declined from its ancient splendor! Often pillaged\nby the natives, burnt in 1819, desolate, ruined, its walls still\nblackened with the flames of devastation, eclipsed by Talcahuana, it\nnow scarcely numbered eight thousand souls. Under the feet of its\nidle inhabitants the streets had grown into prairies. There was no\ncommerce, no activity, no business. The mandolin resounded from every\nbalcony, languishing songs issued from the lattices of the windows, and\nConcepcion, the ancient city of men, had become a village of women and\nchildren.\n\nGlenarvan appeared little desirous of seeking the causes of this\ndecline--though Jacques Paganel attacked him on this subject--and,\nwithout losing an instant, betook himself to the house of J. R.\nBentock, Esq., consul of Her Britanni"}, {"chunk_id": 164, "text": "and it was time. The two ladies exerted themselves\nheroically, but their strength was failing every hour. They dragged\nthemselves along, they no longer walked.\n\nThe next day they started at daybreak, and at eleven o'clock Delegete\ncame in sight, fifty miles from Twofold Bay. Here means of conveyance\nwere quickly obtained. Feeling himself so near the coast, hope returned\nto Glenarvan's heart; perhaps there had been some slight delay, and he\nwould arrive before the Duncan! In twenty-four hours he would reach the\nbay!\n\nAt noon, after a comforting repast, all the travelers took their seats\nin a mail-coach, and left Delegete at the full speed of five strong\nhorses. The postilions, stimulated by the promise of a large reward,\ndrove them along at a rapid rate, over a well-kept road. No time was\nlost in changing horses, and it seemed as if Glenarvan had inspired\nall with his own intense eagerness.\n\n[Illustration: The two ladies exerted themselves heroically, but their\nstrength was failing every hour. They dragged themselves along, they no\nlonger walked.]\n\nAll day and all night they traveled with the same swiftness, and at\nsunrise the next morning a low murmur announced the proximity of the\nIndian Ocean. It was necessary, however, to pass around the bay to gain\nthat part of the coast where Tom Austin was to meet the travelers.\n\nWhen the sea appeared, all eyes quickly surveyed the wide expanse. Was\nthe Duncan there, by a miracle of Providence, as she had been discerned\nbefore by some of them on the Argentine coast? Nothing was seen; sky\nand water mingled in an unbroken horizon; not a sail brightened the\nvast extent of ocean.\n\nOne hope still remained. Perhaps Tom Austin had thought it best to cast\nanchor in Twofold Bay, as the sea was rough and a vessel could not be\nmoored in safety near such shores.\n\n\"To Eden!\" said Glenarvan.\n\nThe mail-coach at once took the road to the right, which ran along the\nedge of the bay, and proceeded towards the little town of Eden, only\nfive miles distant. The postilions stopped not far from the light that\nguarded the entrance to the harbor. Several ships were anchored in the\nroadstead, but none displayed the flag of Malcolm Castle.\n\nGlenarvan, Captain Mangles, and Paganel alighted immediately, and\nhastened to the custom-house. Here they questioned the employees, and\nconsulted the latest arrivals. No vessel had entered the bay for a week.\n\n\"She may not have started!\" cried Glenarvan, who would not despair.\n\"Perhaps we have arrived before her!\"\n\nCaptain Mangles shook his head. He knew Tom Austin; his mate would\nnever have delayed so long to execute an order.\n\n\"I will know what this means,\" said Glenarvan. \"Certainty is better\nthan doubt.\"\n\n[Sidenote: THE LAST HOPE.]\n\nFifteen minutes later a telegram was sent to the ship-brokers of\nMelbourne, and the travelers repaired to the Victoria Hotel. Not long\nafter an answer was delivered to Lord Glenarvan. It read as follows:\n\n\"Lord Glenarvan,\n            Eden, Twofold Bay.\n\n\"Duncan started on the 18th instant for some unknown destination.\"\n\nThe dispatch fell from Glenarvan's hands. There was no more doubt! The\nhonest Scotch yacht, in Ben Joyce's hands, had become a pirate-vessel!\n\nThus ended their search in Australia, begun under such favorable\nauspices. The traces of Captain Grant and his shipwrecked sailors\nseemed irrecoverably lost. This failure had cost the lives of an entire\ncrew. Lord Glenarvan was crushed by the blow, and this courageous\nsearcher, whom the leagued elements had failed to deter, was now\nbaffled by the malice of men.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIV.\n\nA ROUGH CAPTAIN.\n\n\nIf ever the searchers for Captain Grant had reason to despair of seeing\nhim again, was it not when every hope forsook them at once? To what\npart of the world should they venture a new expedition? how explore\nunknown countries?

Doubtless,\nsome chiefs of the Maori tribe had fallen into the hands of the\nEnglish, and the natives would attempt to recover them by way of\nexchange; their situation, therefore, was not one for despair.\n\nMeantime the canoe rapidly ascended the river. Paganel, whose\nchangeable disposition carried him from one extreme to another, had\nregained his hopefulness. He believed that the Maoris were sparing them\nthe fatigue of their journey to the English settlements, and that they\nwere certain to arrive at their destination. He was, therefore, quite\nresigned to his lot, and traced on his map the course of the Waikato\nacross the plains and valleys of the province. Lady Helena and Mary\nGrant, suppressing their terror, conversed in low tones with Glenarvan,\nand the most skillful physiognomist could not have detected on their\nfaces the anxiety of their hearts.\n\nThe Waikato River is worshiped by the natives, as Paganel knew, and\nEnglish and German naturalists have never ascended beyond its junction\nwith the Waipa. Whither did Kai-Koumou intend to take his captives?\nThe geographer could not have guessed if the word \"Taupo,\" frequently\nrepeated, had not attracted his attention. By consulting his map,\nhe saw that this name was applied to a celebrated lake in the most\nmountainous part of the island, and that from it the Waikato flows.\n\nPaganel, addressing Captain Mangles in French, so as not to be\nunderstood by the savages, asked him how fast the canoe was going. The\ncaptain thought about three miles an hour.\n\n\"Then,\" replied the geographer, \"if we do not travel during the night,\nour voyage to the lake will last about four days.\"\n\n\"But whereabouts are the English garrisons?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"It is difficult to say,\" replied Paganel. \"At all events, the war\nmust have reached the province of Taranaki, and probably the troops\nare collected beyond the mountains, on the side of the lake where the\nhabitations of the savages are concentrated.\"\n\n\"God grant it!\" said Lady Helena.\n\nGlenarvan cast a sorrowful glance at his young wife and Mary Grant,\nexposed to the mercy of these fierce natives, and captives in a wild\ncountry, far from all human assistance. But he saw that he was watched\nby Kai-Koumou, and, not wishing to show that one of the captives was\nhis wife, he prudently kept his thoughts to himself, and gazed at the\nbanks of the river with apparent indifference.\n\n[Sidenote: ACCESSIONS, AND PROGRESS.]\n\nThe sun was just sinking below the horizon as the canoe ran upon a bank\nof pumice-stones, which the Waikato carries with it from its source\nin the volcanic mountains. Several trees grew here, as if designed to\nshelter an encampment. Kai-Koumou landed his prisoners.\n\nThe men had their hands tied, the ladies were free. All were placed\nin the centre of the encampment, around which large fires formed an\nimpassable barrier.\n\nBefore Kai-Koumou had informed his captives of his intention to\nexchange them, Glenarvan and Captain Mangles had discussed various\nmethods of recovering their liberty. What they could not venture in the\nboat they hoped to attempt on land, at the hour for encamping, under\ncover of the night.\n\nBut since Glenarvan's conversation with the chief, it seemed wise to\nabandon this design. They must be patient. It was the most prudent\nplan. The exchange offered chances that neither an open attack nor a\nflight across these unknown regions could afford. Many circumstances\nmight indeed arise that would delay, and even prevent, such a\ntransaction; but still it was better to await the result. What,\nmoreover, could ten defenceless men do against thirty well-armed\nsavages? Besides, Glenarvan thought it likely that Kai-Koumou's tribe\nhad lost some chief of high rank whom they were particularly anxious to\nrecover; and he was not mistaken.\n\nThe next day the canoe ascended the river with increased swiftness.\nIt stopped for a moment at the junction of a small river which wound\nacross the plains on the right bank. Here a"}, {"chunk_id": 183, "text": "y as most of\nPaganel's disquisitions and information concerning these islands, and\nthey were before a late hour exchanged for peaceful though probably\ndreamy slumbers, by his hearers.\n\nEarly the next morning the signal for departure was given. The rain had\nceased during the night, and the sky was covered with grayish clouds,\nwhich intercepted the rays of the sun, so that the temperature thus\nmoderated enabled them to endure the fatigues of the journey.\n\nBy consulting the map, Paganel had calculated that they would have to\ntravel eight days. But, instead of following the windings of the coast,\nhe considered it best to proceed to the village of Ngarnavahia, at the\njunction of the Waikato and Waipa rivers. Here the overland mail-road\npassed, and it would thence be easy to reach Drury, and rest, after\ntheir hardships, in a comfortable hotel.\n\nBut before they left the shore their attention was drawn to the large\nnumber of seals, of a peculiar appearance and genus, which lay on the\nbroad sands daily washed by the tidal water. These seals, with their\nrounded heads, their upturned look, their expressive eyes, presented an\nappearance, almost a physiognomy, that was mild and wellnigh tender,\nand served to recall to the traveler's memory the tales about the\nsirens of the olden and modern times, who served as the enchantresses\nto just such inhospitable shores as that seemed on which they had\nthemselves been cast. These animals, which are very numerous on the\ncoast of New Zealand, are hunted and killed for the sake of their\noil and their skins, and Paganel was of course able to tell how much\nwithin the last few years they had been searched for by the traders and\nnavigators on these seas.\n\n[Illustration: These seals, with rounded heads, upturned look,\nexpressive eyes, presented an appearance, almost a physiognomy, that\nwas mild and wellnigh tender.]\n\n[Illustration: The New Zealand \"kiwi,\" known to naturalists as the\napteryx.]\n\nWhilst speaking of these matters, Robert drew Paganel's attention to\nsome curious amphibious creatures, resembling the seals, but larger,\nwhich were devouring with rapidity the large stones lying on the shore.\n\n\"Look,\" said he, \"here are seals which feed on pebbles.\"\n\nPaganel assured them that these sea-elephants were only weighting\nthemselves preparatory to their descent into the water, and protested\nthat if they would but wait for a time they might see them descend and\nsubsequently return when they had unloaded themselves. The first part\nof this programme they saw accomplished; but, greatly to Paganel's\ngrief, Glenarvan would not longer delay the party, and they soon began\nto see inland beauties and curiosities of another sort.\n\nThe district through which they had to walk this day and the next was\none very thick with brush and under-wood, and there was no possibility\nof horse or vehicle passing or meeting them. They now regretted the\nabsence of their Australian cart, for the height and frequency of\nthe large ferns in the neighborhood prevented their making any rapid\nprogress on foot.\n\n[Sidenote: THE LAST STAGE OF PERIPATETICS.]\n\nHere and there, however, Robert and Paganel would rejoice together\nover some choice bush or bird that they had met with. Notable among\nthe latter was the New Zealand \"kiwi,\" known to naturalists as the\napteryx, and which is becoming very scarce, from the pursuit of its\nmany enemies. Robert discovered in a nest on the ground a couple of\nthese birds without tails or wings, but with four toes on the foot, and\na long beak or bill like that of a woodcock, and small white feathers\nall over its body. Of this bird there was then an entire absence in the\nzoological collections of Europe, and Paganel indulged the hope that he\nmight be able to be the proud contributor of such a valuable specimen\nto the \"Jardin\" of his own city. For the present, at least, the\nrealization of his hopes had to be deferred; and at length, after some\ndays of weariness and continued travel, the party reached the banks\nof the "}, {"chunk_id": 169, "text": "ed to be\namicable feelings expressed by the islanders toward himself, a number\nof them coming back to his ship, and being apparently well pleased to\ncultivate intercourse. But on the next day, as he sent his boat to\nfind good anchorage nearer to the shore, seven canoes of the islanders\nattacked it most violently and suddenly, causing it to capsize, and so\nvigorously assailing its occupants with their pikes that it was with\ndifficulty any of them were able to swim back to their ship, leaving\nthose of their companions who were not drowned to be butchered by the\nnatives.\n\n[Sidenote: A SADDENING HISTORY.]\n\nOf course he did not forget to mention that a French navigator,\nSurville by name, was the next to visit the shores, and that his\nvisit likewise was the cause of bloodshed and misery. But he gave\nthem a more lengthy and extended narrative of Captain Cook's voyages,\nwhich were the most important in their results as well as the most\ninteresting and tragic in many of their incidents. It was on the 6th\nof October, 1769, that this navigator first landed on the shores which\nhe visited twice afterwards, and each time added greatly to the stock\nof previous knowledge concerning these islands, their productions, and\ntheir inhabitants. By him it was first ascertained that cannibalism was\npracticed by some, if not all, of the tribes at that time; and it was\nvery evident, from the manner of Paganel's narration, that hereabout\nlay the extremely sensitive point of the worthy geographer's fears and\nforebodings. However, he was not deterred from rehearsing how one and\nanother not merely visited, but began to settle, on the island, so that\nin the treaty of 1814 it was formally recognized as belonging to Great\nBritain, and twenty years after was important enough to have a separate\nofficial and governmental establishment.\n\nPaganel also told, at great length, the tales of many of the sad\nincidents which from time to time have marked even the commercial\nintercourse between the European and the Maori; as, for instance, the\nsad tale of conflict and bloodshed connected with the death of Captain\nMarion, a French navigator, in 1772. He had landed near the spot where\nSurville had ill-treated some of the natives and traitorously seized\na son of the chief, Takouri, who yet appeared to welcome this next\nFrench visitant, though remembering none the less the terrible duty of\nvengeance which is felt by the Maori to be so binding.\n\n[Illustration: It was on the sixth of October, 1769, that this\nnavigator (Captain Cook) first landed on the shores.]\n\nFor a long time the cloak of friendship was worn by the natives, the\nmore thoroughly to lull the suspicions of the whites, and to entice a\nlarger number on shore; in which endeavor they succeeded only too well.\nThe French ships being greatly out of repair, Marion was induced to\nfell timber at some distance in the interior, and to establish in this\noccupation a great number of his men, going frequently to them, and\nremaining with them and the apparently friendly chiefs. On one of these\noccasions the Maoris fulfilled their revengeful project with a terrible\nsatisfaction to themselves. Only one man, of all those in the interior,\nmanaged to escape, the commander himself falling a prey to their\nvengeance. They then endeavored to kill the second in command, who,\nwith several others, was nearer to the shore. These, of course, at once\nstarted for their boats; breathless, they reached them, hotly pursued\nto the water's edge by the insatiate savages. Then, safe themselves,\nthe French marksmen picked off the chief, and the previous exultation\nof the aborigines was, even in the hour of their triumph, turned to\nlamentation, coupled with wonder at the terrible power of the white\nman's fire-barrel.\n\n[Illustration: Safe themselves, the French marksmen picked off the\nchief.]\n\nAll this and much more did the geographer narrate; but it must be\nconfessed that he neither spoke, nor did they listen, with the\ncomplacency evinced in his previous"}, {"chunk_id": 188, "text": "event, such a\ntransaction; but still it was better to await the result.

Were Glenarvan and his\ncompanions to be released with a few thorough drenchings? At the height\nof this struggle of the elements, suddenly there appeared at the end\nof the branch which extended horizontally, a flaming globe, of the\nsize of a fist, and surrounded by a black smoke. This ball, after\nrevolving a few moments, burst like a bombshell, and with a noise that\nwas distinguishable in the midst of the general tumult. A sulphurous\nvapor filled the atmosphere. There was a moment of silence, and then\nTom Austin was heard crying,--\n\n\"The tree is on fire!\"\n\nHe was right. In a moment the flame, as if it had been communicated\nto an immense piece of fireworks, spread along the west side of the\ntree.

And, in truth, the foot of the\ntree was seen to be surrounded by the most formidable monsters.\nTheir scales glittered in broad plates of light, sharply defined\nby the conflagration. Their flat tails, their pointed heads, their\nprotruding eyes, their jaws, extending back of their ears, all these\ncharacteristic signs were unmistakable. Paganel recognized the\nvoracious alligators peculiar to America, and called caymans in Spanish\ncountries. There were a dozen of them, beating the water with their\npowerful tails, and attacking the tree with their terrible teeth.\n\nAt this sight the unfortunate travelers felt themselves lost indeed. A\nhorrible death was in store for them,--to perish either by the flames\nor by the teeth of the alligators. There are circumstances in which\nman is powerless to struggle, and where a raging element can only be\nrepulsed by another equally strong. Glenarvan, with a wild look, gazed\nat the fire and water leagued against him, not knowing what aid to\nimplore of Heaven.\n\nThe storm had now begun to abate; but it had developed in the air a\ngreat quantity of vapor, which the electric phenomena were about to\nset in violent commotion. To the south an enormous water-spout was\ngradually forming,--an inverted cone of mist, uniting the raging waters\nbelow to the stormy clouds above. "}, {"chunk_id": 209, "text": "moving. They dug a sort of\ngroove for it down the side of the mountain, that it might slide on an\ninclined plane.\n\nAs their action increased, the trembling of the earth became more\nviolent. Hollow rumblings and hissings sounded under the thin\ncrust. But the bold experimenters, like real Vulcans, governing the\nunderground fires, worked on in silence. Several cracks and a few gusts\nof hot smoke warned them that their position was becoming dangerous.\nBut a final effort detached the block, which glided down the slope of\nthe mountain and disappeared.\n\nThe thin covering at once yielded. An incandescent column poured forth\ntowards the sky with loud explosions, while streams of boiling water\nand lava rolled towards the encampment of the natives and the valleys\nbelow. The whole peak trembled, and you might almost have thought that\nit was disappearing in a general conflagration.\n\nGlenarvan and his companions had scarcely time to escape the shock of\nthe eruption. They fled to the inclosure of the tomb, but not without\nreceiving a few scalding drops of the water, which bubbled and exhaled\na strong sulphureous odor.\n\nThen mud, lava, and volcanic fragments mingled in the scene of\ndevastation. Torrents of flame furrowed the sides of the Maunganamu.\nThe adjoining mountains glowed in the light of the eruption, and the\ndeep valleys were illumined with a vivid brightness.\n\nThe savages were soon aroused, both by the noise and the heat\nof the lava that flowed in a scalding tide through the midst of\ntheir encampment. Those whom the fiery flood had not reached fled,\nand ascended the surrounding hills, turning and gazing back at\nthis terrific phenomenon, with which their god, in his wrath, had\noverwhelmed the desecrators of the sacred mountain; while at certain\nmoments they were heard howling their consecratory cry:\n\n\"Taboo! taboo! taboo!\"\n\n[Illustration: The fugitives made themselves levers out of the stakes\nof the tomb.]\n\n[Illustration: An incandescent column poured forth towards the sky with\nloud explosions, while streams of boiling water and lava rolled towards\nthe encampment of the natives.]\n\nMeantime an enormous quantity of vapor, melted stones, and lava had\nescaped from the crater. It was no longer a simple geyser. All this\nvolcanic effervescence had hitherto been confined beneath the crust of\nthe peak, since the outlets of Tangariro sufficed for its expansion;\nbut as a new opening had been made, it had rushed forth with extreme\nviolence.\n\nAll night long, during the storm that raged above and below, the peak\nwas shaken with a commotion that could not but alarm Glenarvan. The\nprisoners, concealed behind the palisade of the tomb, watched the\nfearful progress of the outbreak.\n\nMorning came. The fury of the volcano had not moderated. Thick,\nyellowish vapors mingled with the flames, and torrents of lava poured\nin every direction. Glenarvan, with eye alert and beating heart,\nglanced between the interstices of the inclosure, and surveyed the camp\nof the Maoris.\n\nThe natives had fled to the neighboring plateaus, beyond the reach of\nthe volcano. Several corpses, lying at the foot of the peak, had been\ncharred by the fire. Farther on, towards the pah, the lava had consumed\na number of huts, that were still smoking. The savages, in scattered\ngroups, were gazing at the vapory summit of Maunganamu with religious\nawe.\n\nKai-Koumou came into the midst of his warriors, and Glenarvan\nrecognized him. The chief advanced to the base of the peak, on the side\nspared by the eruption, but did not cross the first slopes. Here, with\noutstretched arms, like a sorcerer exorcising, he made a few grimaces,\nthe meaning of which did not escape the prisoners. As Paganel had\nforeseen, Kai-Koumou was invoking upon the mountain a more rigorous\ntaboo.\n\nSoon after, the natives descended, in single file, the winding paths\nthat led towards the pah.\n\n[Sidenote: A WEARY WAITING.]\n\n\"They are going!\" cried Glenarvan. \"They are abandoning their post!\nGod be thanked! Our scheme has succeed"}, {"chunk_id": 194, "text": "\nshoulders and surveyed the fortification. No native was seen; only the\nsentinels guarded in turn at the door of their prison.\n\nBut on the third day the huts were opened. The savages, men, women,\nand children, to the number of several hundreds, assembled in the pah,\nsilent and calm. Kai-Koumou came out of his house, and, surrounded by\nthe principal warriors of his tribe, took his place on a mound several\nfeet high in the centre of the fortification. The crowd of natives\nformed a semicircle around him, and the whole assembly preserved\nabsolute silence.\n\nAt a sign from the chief, a warrior advanced towards the temple.\n\n\"Remember!\" said Lady Helena to her husband.\n\nGlenarvan clasped his wife to his heart. At this moment Mary Grant\napproached John Mangles.\n\n\"Lord and Lady Glenarvan,\" said she, \"I think that, if a wife can die\nby the hand of her husband to escape a degrading existence, a maiden\ncan likewise die by the hand of her lover. John (for I may tell you\nat this critical moment), have I not long been your betrothed in the\ndepths of your heart? May I rely upon you, dear John, as Lady Helena\ndoes upon Lord Glenarvan?\"\n\n\"Mary!\" cried the young captain, in terror. \"Ah! dear Mary----\"\n\nHe could not finish: the mat was raised, and the captives were dragged\ntowards Kai-Koumou. The two women were resigned to their fate, while\nthe men concealed their anguish beneath a calmness that showed\nsuperhuman self-control. They came before the chief, who did not delay\nsentence.\n\n\"You killed Kara-Tété!\" said he to Glenarvan.\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n[Sidenote: THE BEGINNING OF THE END.]\n\n\"You shall die to-morrow at sunrise.\"\n\n\"Alone?\" inquired Glenarvan, whose heart beat quickly.\n\n\"What! as if our Tohonga's life were not more precious than yours!\"\ncried Kai-Koumou, whose eyes expressed a fierce regret.\n\nAt this moment a commotion took place among the natives. Glenarvan cast\na rapid glance around him. The crowd opened, and a warrior, dripping\nwith sweat and overcome with fatigue, appeared.\n\nAs soon as Kai-Koumou perceived him, he said in English, evidently that\nhe might be understood by the captives:\n\n\"You come from the camp of the pale-faces?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the Maori.\n\n\"You saw the prisoner, our Tohonga?\"\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n\"Is he living?\"\n\n\"He is dead! The English have shot him.\"\n\nThe fate of Glenarvan and his companions was settled.\n\n\"You shall all die to-morrow at daybreak!\" cried Kai-Koumou.\n\nThe unfortunates were therefore to suffer a common death. Lady Helena\nand Mary Grant raised towards heaven a look of thankfulness.\n\nThe captives were not taken back to the temple. They were to attend\nthat day the funeral of the dead chief, and the bloody ceremonies\nconnected therewith. A party of natives conducted them to the foot of\nan enormous koudi, where these guardians remained without losing sight\nof their prisoners. The rest of the tribe, absorbed in their official\nmourning, seemed to have forgotten them.\n\nThe customary three days had elapsed since the death of Kara-Tété. The\nsoul of the deceased had therefore forever abandoned its mortal abode.\nThe sacred rites began.\n\nThe body was carried to a small mound in the centre of the\nfortification, clothed in splendid costume, and enveloped in a\nmagnificent flaxen mat. The head was adorned with plumes, and wore a\ncrown of green leaves. The face, arms, and breast had been rubbed with\noil, and therefore showed no mortification.\n\nThe parents and friends of the deceased came to the foot of the\nmound, and all at once, as if some director were beating time to a\nfuneral dirge, a great concert of cries, groans, and sobs arose on the\nair. They mourned the dead in plaintive and modulated cadences. His\nrelations struck their heads together; his kinswomen lacerated their\nfaces with their nails, and showed themselves more lavish of blood than\nof tears. These unfortunate females conscientiously fulfilled their\nbarbarous duty.\n\nBut these demonstrations were not enough to appease the soul of the\ndeceased, whose wrath would doubtless hav"}, {"chunk_id": 196, "text": "scene of cannibalism, which followed in all\nits horrible details.]\n\n[Illustration: The corpses, folded together, in a sitting posture,\nand tied in their clothes by a girdle of withes, were placed on this\nprimitive bier.]\n\nBut Kai-Koumou had preserved his reason in the midst of the general\nintoxication. He allowed this bloody orgy an hour to reach its utmost\nintensity. The last act of the funeral was played with the usual rites.\n\nThe bodies of Kara-Tété and his wife were taken up, and their limbs\nbent and gathered against the stomach, according to the New Zealand\ncustom. The place for the tomb had been chosen outside of the\nfortification, about two miles distant, on the summit of a small\nmountain, called Maunganamu, situated on the right shore of the lake.\n\nThither the bodies were to be carried. Two very rude palanquins, or\nrather litters, were brought to the foot of the mound. The corpses,\nfolded together, in a sitting posture, and tied in their clothes by a\ngirdle of withes, were placed on this primitive bier. Four warriors\nbore it between them, and the entire tribe, chanting the funeral hymn,\nfollowed them in procession to the place of burial.\n\nThe captives, who were always watched, saw them leave the inner\ninclosure of the pah, and then the songs and cries gradually died away.\nFor about half an hour this funeral escort continued in sight, in the\ndepths of the valley. Finally they perceived it again winding along\nthe mountain paths. The distance gave a fantastic appearance to the\nundulating movements of the long, sinuous column.\n\nThe tribe stopped at the summit of the mountain, which was eight\nhundred feet high, at the place prepared for Kara-Tété's interment.\nA common Maori would have had only a hole and a heap of stones for a\ngrave; but for a powerful and dreaded chief, destined doubtless for a\nspeedy deification, a tomb worthy of his exploits was reserved.\n\n[Sidenote: THE LAST NIGHT.]\n\nThe sepulchre had been surrounded by palisades, while stakes,\nornamented with faces reddened with ochre, stood beside the grave\nwhere the bodies were to lie. The relatives had not forgotten that the\n\"waidoua\" (the spirit of the dead) feeds on substantial nourishment\nlike the body during this perishable life. Food had therefore been\ndeposited in the inclosure, together with the weapons and clothes of\nthe deceased.\n\nNothing was wanting for the comfort of the tomb. Husband and wife were\nlaid side by side, and then covered with earth and grass after a series\nof renewed lamentations. Then the procession silently descended the\nmountain, and now no one could ascend it under penalty of death, for it\nwas tabooed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LI.\n\nSTRANGELY LIBERATED.\n\n\nJust as the sun was disappearing behind Lake Taupo, the captives were\nled back to their prison. They were not to leave it again until the\nsummit of the Wahiti mountains should kindle with the first beams of\nthe day. One night remained to prepare for death. In spite of the\nfaintness, in spite of the horror with which they were seized, they\nshared their repast in common.\n\n\"We shall need all the strength possible to face death,\" said\nGlenarvan. \"We must show these barbarians how Europeans and Christians\ncan die.\"\n\nThe meal being finished, Lady Helena repeated the evening prayer aloud,\nwhile all her companions, with uncovered heads, joined her. Having\nfulfilled this duty, and enjoyed this privilege, the prisoners embraced\neach other. Lady Helena and Mary Grant then retired to one corner of\nthe hut, and stretched themselves upon a mat. Sleep, which soothes all\nwoes, soon closed their eyes, and they slumbered in each other's arms,\novercome by fatigue and long wakefulness.\n\nGlenarvan, taking his friends aside, said:\n\n\"My dear companions, our lives and those of these poor ladies are in\nGod's hands.

What,\nmoreover, could ten defenceless men do against thirty well-armed\nsavages? Besides, Glenarvan thought it likely that Kai-Koumou's tribe\nhad lost some chief of high rank whom they were particularly anxious to\nrecover; and he was not mistaken.\n\nThe next day the canoe ascended the river with increased swiftness.\nIt stopped for a moment at the junction of a small river which wound\nacross the plains on the right bank. Here another canoe, with ten\nnatives on board, joined Kai-Koumou. The warriors merely exchanged\nsalutations, and then continued their course. The new-comers had\nrecently fought against the English troops, as could be seen by their\ntattered garments, their gory weapons, and the wounds that still bled\nbeneath their rags. They were gloomy and taciturn, and, with the\nindifference common to all savage races, paid no attention to the\ncaptives.\n\nTowards evening Kai-Koumou landed at the foot of the mountains,\nwhose nearer ridges reached precipitously to the river-bank. Here\ntwenty natives, who had disembarked from their canoes, were making\npreparations for the night. Fires blazed beneath the trees. A chief,\nequal in rank to Kai-Koumou, advanced with measured pace, and, rubbing\nhis nose against that of the latter, saluted him cordially. The\nprisoners were stationed in the centre of the encampment, and guarded\nwith extreme vigilance.\n\nThe next morning the ascent of the Waikato was resumed. Other boats\ncame from various affluents of the river. Sixty warriors, evidently\nfugitives from the last insurrection, had now assembled, and were\nreturning, more or less wounded in the fray, to the mountain districts.\nSometimes a song arose from the canoes, as they advanced in single\nfile. One native struck up the patriotic ode of the mysterious \"Pihé,\"\nthe national hymn that calls the Maoris to battle. The full and\nsonorous voice of the singer waked the echoes of the mountains; and\nafter each stanza his comrades struck their breasts, and sang the\nwarlike verses in chorus. Then they seized their oars again, and the\ncanoes were headed up stream.\n\nDuring the day a singular sight enlivened the voyage. About four\no'clock the canoe, without lessening its speed, guided by the steady\nhand of the chief, dashed through a narrow gorge. Eddies broke\nviolently against numerous small islands, which rendered navigation\nexceeding dangerous. Never could it be more hazardous to capsize, for\nthe banks afforded no refuge, and whoever had set foot on the porous\ncrust of the shore would probably have perished. At this point the\nriver flowed between warm springs, oxide of iron colored the muddy\nground a brilliant red, and not a yard of firm earth could be seen.\nThe air was heavy with a penetrating sulphureous odor. The natives did\nnot regard it, but the captives were seriously annoyed by the noxious\nvapors exhaled from the fissures of the soil and the bubbles that\nburst and discharged their gaseous contents. Yet, however disagreeable\nthese emanations were, the eye could not but admire this magnificent\nspectacle.\n\n[Illustration: At this point the river flowed between warm springs, and\nnot a yard of firm earth could be seen.]\n\nThe canoes soon after entered a dense cloud of white smoke, whose\nwreaths rose in gradually decreasing circles above the river. On the\nshores a hundred geysers, some shooting forth masses of vapor, and\nothers overflowing in liquid columns, varied their effects, like the\njets and cascades of a fountain. It seemed as though some engineer was\ndirecting at his pleasure the outflowings of these springs, as the\nwaters and vapor, mingling in the air, formed rainbows in the sunbeams.\n\nFor two miles the canoes glided within this vapory atmosphere,\nenveloped in its warm waves that rolled along the surface of the water.\nThen the sulphureous smoke disappeared, and a pure swift current of\nfresh air refreshed the panting voyagers. The region of the springs was\npassed.

The sunrise was\nmagnificent. The orb of day, like a gilded metal disk, rose from the\nocean, as from an immense and silvery basin. The ship glided in the\nmidst of a splendid iridescence, and you would truly have thought that\nher sails expanded under the influence of the sun's rays, whilst even\nthe crew of the yacht silently admired this reappearance of the orb of\nday.\n\n\"What a magnificent spectacle!\" said Lady Helena, at last. \"This is\nthe beginning of a beautiful day. May the wind not prove contrary, but\nfavor the progress of the Duncan!\"\n\n\"No better weather could be desired, my dear Helena,\" replied Lord\nGlenarvan; \"we have no reason to complain of the commencement of the\nvoyage.\"\n\n\"Will it be a long one, my dear Edward?\"\n\n\"That is for the captain to answer,\" said he. \"Are we progressing well?\nAre you satisfied with your vessel, captain?\"\n\n\"Very well indeed,\" was the answer. \"She is a marvelous craft, and a\nsailor likes to feel her under his feet.

I tell you he is a boy who mocks\nsea-sickness. Only look at him!\"\n\nAt a gesture of the captain, all eyes were turned towards the mainmast,\nand every one could perceive Robert, suspended by the stays of the\nforetop-gallant sail, a hundred feet aloft. Mary could not restrain a\nmotion of fear.\n\n\"Oh, be easy, miss!\" said Captain Mangles. \"I will answer for him, and\npromise you I will present, in a short time, a famous sailor to Captain\nGrant; for we shall find that worthy captain.\"\n\n\"May Heaven hear you, sir!\" replied the young girl.\n\n\"My dear child,\" said Lord Glenarvan, \"there is in all this something\nprovidential, which ought to give us hope.

He sees no other, even for a woman. Is it not so,\nJohn?\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly, your lordship,\" replied the young captain; \"and yet, I\nconfess, Miss Grant is better in her place on deck, than taking a reef\nin the top-sail.

The major was a man of fifty, of calm,\nregular features, who did as he was bid; of an excellent and superior\ncharacter, modest, taciturn, peaceable, and mild; always agreeing\nwith anything or any one, disputing nothing, and neither contradicting\nhimself nor exaggerating. He would mount with measured step the\nstaircase to his bed-chamber, even were a cannon-ball behind him; and\nprobably to his dying day would never find an opportunity to fly into a\npassion.\n\nThis man possessed, in a high degree, not only the common courage of\nthe battle-field (that physical bravery due only to nervous strength),\nbut, better still, moral courage, that is to say, firmness of soul. If\nhe had a fault, it was that of being absolutely Scotch from head to\nfoot, a pure-blooded Caledonian, an infatuated observer of the ancient\ncustoms of his country. Through his relationship to the Glenarvans he\nlived at Malcolm Castle; and as major and military man it was very\nnatural that he should be found on board the Duncan.\n\nSuch, then, were the passengers of this yacht, summoned by unforeseen\ncircumstances to accomplish one of the most surprising voyages of\nmodern times. Since her arrival at the wharf at Glasgow, she had\nmonopolized the public attention. A considerable number came every day\nto visit her. They were interested in her alone, and spoke only of her,\nto the great umbrage of the other captains of the port, among others\nCaptain Burton, commanding the Scotia, a magnificent steamer, moored\nbeside the Duncan, and bound for Calcutta. The Scotia, from her size,\nhad a right to consider the Duncan as a mere fly-boat. Nevertheless,\nall the attraction centred in Lord Glenarvan's yacht, and increased\nfrom day to day.\n\nThe time of departure approached. Captain Mangles had shown himself\nskillful and expeditious. A month after her trial trip in the Frith of\nClyde, the Duncan, laden, provisioned, and equipped, was ready to put\nto sea. The 25th of August was appointed for the time of departure,\nwhich would enable the yacht to reach the southern latitudes by the\nbeginning of spring. Lord Glenarvan, when his plan was matured, did\nnot neglect to make investigations into the hardships and perils of the\nvoyage; yet he did not hesitate on this account, but prepared to leave\nMalcolm Castle.\n\nOn the 24th of August, Lord and Lady Glenarvan, Major MacNabb, Mary and\nRobert Grant, Mr. Olbinett, the steward of the yacht, and his wife, who\nwas in the service of Lady Glenarvan, left the castle, after taking an\naffectionate farewell of their family servants. Several hours afterward\nthey found themselves on board. Many of the population of Glasgow\nwelcomed with sympathetic admiration the young and courageous lady who\nrenounced the pleasures of a life of luxury, and sailed to the rescue\nof the shipwrecked sailors.\n\nThe apartments of Lord Glenarvan and his wife occupied the entire stern\nof the vessel. They consisted of two bed-chambers, a parlor, and two\ndressing-rooms, adjoining which was an open square inclosed by six\ncabins, five of which were occupied by Mary and Robert Grant, Mr. and\nMrs. Olbinett, and Major MacNabb. As for the cabins of the captain and\nthe mate, they were situated in the forecastle, and opened on the deck.\nThe crew were lodged between-decks very comfortably, for the yacht of\ncourse carried nothing but her coal, provisions, and armament.\n\nThe Duncan was to start on the night of the 24th, as the tide fell at\nthree o'clock in the morning. But first those who were present were\nwitness to a touching scene. At eight in the evening Lord Glenarvan and\nhis companions, the entire crew, from the firemen to the captain, all\nwho were to take part in this voyage of sacrifice, left the yacht,"}, {"chunk_id": 172, "text": "captain seized the sailor's hand.\n\n\"The surf!\" said he.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Wilson. \"The sea is breaking on the reefs.\"\n\n\"Not more than two cable-lengths distant.\"\n\n\"Not more! The shore is here!\"\n\nCaptain Mangles leaned over the railing, gazed at the dark waves, and\ncried:\n\n\"The sounding-lead, Wilson!\"\n\nThe skipper, who was in the forecastle, did not seem to suspect his\nsituation. Wilson grasped the sounding-line, which lay coiled in its\npail, and rushed into the port-shrouds. He cast the lead; the rope\nslipped between his fingers; at the third knot it stopped.\n\n\"Three fathoms!\" cried Wilson.\n\n\"We are on the breakers!\" shouted the sober captain to the stupefied\none.\n\nWhether the former saw Halley shrug his shoulders or not is of little\nconsequence. At all events, he rushed towards the wheel and crowded\nthe helm hard alee, while Wilson, letting go the line, hauled upon the\ntop-sail yard-arms to luff the ship. The sailor who was steering, and\nhad been forcibly pushed aside, did not at all understand this sudden\nattack.\n\n\"To the port-yards! let loose the sails!\" cried the young captain,\nmanaging so as to escape the reefs.\n\nFor half a minute, the starboard side of the brig grazed the rocks,\nand, in spite of the darkness, John perceived a roaring line of\nbreakers that foamed a few yards from the ship.\n\n[Sidenote: VERY CRITICAL CIRCUMSTANCES.]\n\nAt this moment Will Halley, becoming conscious of the imminent danger,\nlost his presence of mind. His sailors, who were scarcely sober,\ncould not comprehend his orders. Moreover, his incoherent words and\ncontradictory commands showed that this stupid drunkard's coolness\nhad failed. He was surprised by the nearness of the land, which was\nonly eight miles off, when he thought it thirty or forty. The currents\nhad taken him unawares, and thrown him out of his ordinary course.\n\n[Illustration: The sailor who was steering, and had been forcibly\npushed aside, did not at all understand this sudden attack.]\n\nHowever, Captain Mangles's prompt management had rescued the brig from\nher peril; but he did not know his position. Perhaps he was inclosed by\na chain of reefs. The wind blew fresh from the east, and at every pitch\nthey might strike bottom.\n\nThe roar of the surf was soon redoubled, and it was necessary to luff\nstill more. John crowded the helm down and braced farther to leeward.\nThe breakers multiplied beneath the prow of the ship, and they were\nobliged to tack so as to put to sea. Would this manoeuvre succeed with\nsuch an unsteady vessel, and under such reduced sail? It was uncertain,\nbut as their only chance they must venture it.\n\n\"Hard alee!\" cried Captain Mangles to Wilson.\n\nThe Macquarie began to approach the new line of reefs. Soon the\nwater foamed above the submerged rocks. It was a moment of torturing\nsuspense. The spray glittered on the crests of the waves. You would\nhave thought a phosphorescent glow had suddenly illumined the water.\nWilson and Mulready forced down the wheel with their whole weight.\n\nSuddenly a shock was felt. The vessel had struck upon a rock. The\nbob-stays broke, and nearly overthrew the mainmast. Could they come\nabout without any other injury? No; for all at once there was a calm,\nand the ship veered to windward again, and her movements suddenly\nceased. A lofty wave seized and bore her forward towards the reefs,\nwhile she rolled heavily. The mainmast went by the board with all its\nrigging, the brig heaved twice and was motionless, leaning over to\nstarboard. The pump-lights were shattered in pieces, and the passengers\nrushed to the deck; but the waves were sweeping it from one end to\nthe other, and they could not remain without danger. Captain Mangles,\nknowing that the ship was firmly imbedded in the sand, besought them\nfor their own sakes to go below again.\n\n\"The truth, John?\" asked Glenarvan, faintly.\n\n\"The truth, my lord, is that we shall not founder. As for being\ndestroyed by the sea, that is another question; but we have time to\ntake counsel.\"\n\n\"Is it midnight?\"\n\n\"Yes,"}, {"chunk_id": 202, "text": "d in on all sides.\n\n\"Let us go down,\" cried he, \"before our only way of escape is blocked\nup.\"\n\nBut just as the ladies rose by a final effort, MacNabb stopped them,\nand said:\n\n\"It is useless, Glenarvan. Look!\"\n\nAnd all saw, indeed, that an inexplicable change had taken place in the\nmovements of the Maoris. Their pursuit had been suddenly interrupted.\nTheir ascent of the mountain had ceased, as if by an imperious\ninterdict. The crowd of natives had checked their swiftness, and\nhalted, like the waves of the sea before an impassable rock.\n\nAll the savages, thirsting for blood, were now ranged along the foot\nof the mountain, yelling, gesticulating, and brandishing guns and\nhatchets; but they did not advance a single foot. Their dogs, like\nthemselves, as though chained to earth, howled with rage.\n\nWhat was the difficulty? What invisible power restrained the natives?\nThe fugitives gazed without comprehending, fearing that the charm that\nenchained Kai-Koumou's tribe would dissolve.\n\nSuddenly Captain Mangles uttered a cry that caused his companions to\nturn. He pointed to a little fortress at the summit of the peak.\n\n\"The tomb of the chief Kara-Tété!\" cried Robert.\n\n\"Are you in earnest?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"Yes, my lord, it is the tomb; I recognize it.\"\n\nRobert was right. Fifty feet above, at the extreme point of the\nmountain, stood a small palisaded inclosure of freshly-painted stakes.\nGlenarvan, likewise, recognized the sepulchre of the Maori chief. In\ntheir wanderings they had come to the top of the Maunganamu, where\nKara-Tété had been buried.\n\nFollowed by his companions, he climbed the sides of the peak, to the\nvery foot of the tomb. A large opening, covered with mats, formed the\nentrance. Glenarvan was about to enter, when, all at once, he started\nback suddenly.\n\n\"A savage!\" said he.\n\n\"A savage in this tomb?\" inquired the major.\n\n\"Yes, MacNabb.\"\n\n\"What matter? Let us enter.\"\n\nGlenarvan, the major, Robert, and Captain Mangles passed into the\ninclosure. A Maori was there, clad in a great flax mantle. The darkness\nof the sepulchre did not permit them to distinguish his features. He\nappeared very calm, and was eating his breakfast with the most perfect\nindifference.\n\nGlenarvan was about to address him, when the native, anticipating him,\nsaid, in an amiable tone, and in excellent English:\n\n\"Be seated, my dear lord; breakfast is awaiting you.\"\n\nIt was Paganel. At his voice all rushed into the tomb, and gazed with\nwonder at the worthy geographer. Paganel was found! The common safety\nwas represented in him. They were going to question him: they wished\nto know how and why he was on the top of the mountain; but Glenarvan\nchecked this unseasonable curiosity.\n\n[Illustration: \"Be seated, my dear lord; breakfast is awaiting you.\"]\n\n\"The savages!\" said he.\n\n\"The savages,\" replied Paganel, shrugging his shoulders, \"are\nindividuals whom I supremely despise.\"\n\n\"But can they not----?\"\n\n\"They! the imbeciles! Come and see them.\"\n\nEach followed Paganel, who issued from the tomb. The Maoris were in the\nsame place, surrounding the foot of the peak, and uttering terrible\ncries.\n\n\"Cry and howl till you are tired, miserable creatures!\" said Paganel.\n\"I defy you to climb this mountain!\"\n\n\"And why?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"Because the chief is buried here; this tomb protects us, and the\nmountain is tabooed.\"\n\n\"Tabooed?\"\n\n\"Yes, my friends; and that is why I took refuge here, as in one of\nthose asylums of the Middle Ages, open to unfortunates.\"\n\nIndeed, the mountain was tabooed, and by this consecration had become\ninaccessible by the superstitious savages.\n\nThe safety of the fugitives was not yet certain, but there was a\nsalutary respite, of which they strove to take advantage. Glenarvan, a\nprey to unspeakable emotion, did not venture a word; while the major\nnodded his head with an air of genuine satisfaction.\n\n\"And now, my friends,\" said Paganel, \"if these brutes expect us to test\ntheir patience they are mistaken.

What,\nmoreover, could ten defenceless men do against thirty well-armed\nsavages? Besides, Glenarvan thought it likely that Kai-Koumou's tribe\nhad lost some chief of high rank whom they were particularly anxious to\nrecover; and he was not mistaken.\n\nThe next day the canoe ascended the river with increased swiftness.\nIt stopped for a moment at the junction of a small river which wound\nacross the plains on the right bank. Here another canoe, with ten\nnatives on board, joined Kai-Koumou. The warriors merely exchanged\nsalutations, and then continued their course. The new-comers had\nrecently fought against the English troops, as could be seen by their\ntattered garments, their gory weapons, and the wounds that still bled\nbeneath their rags. They were gloomy and taciturn, and, with the\nindifference common to all savage races, paid no attention to the\ncaptives.\n\nTowards evening Kai-Koumou landed at the foot of the mountains,\nwhose nearer ridges reached precipitously to the river-bank. Here\ntwenty natives, who had disembarked from their canoes, were making\npreparations for the night. Fires blazed beneath the trees. A chief,\nequal in rank to Kai-Koumou, advanced with measured pace, and, rubbing\nhis nose against that of the latter, saluted him cordially. The\nprisoners were stationed in the centre of the encampment, and guarded\nwith extreme vigilance.\n\nThe next morning the ascent of the Waikato was resumed. Other boats\ncame from various affluents of the river. Sixty warriors, evidently\nfugitives from the last insurrection, had now assembled, and were\nreturning, more or less wounded in the fray, to the mountain districts.\nSometimes a song arose from the canoes, as they advanced in single\nfile. One native struck up the patriotic ode of the mysterious \"Pihé,\"\nthe national hymn that calls the Maoris to battle. The full and\nsonorous voice of the singer waked the echoes of the mountains; and\nafter each stanza his comrades struck their breasts, and sang the\nwarlike verses in chorus. Then they seized their oars again, and the\ncanoes were headed up stream.\n\nDuring the day a singular sight enlivened the voyage. About four\no'clock the canoe, without lessening its speed, guided by the steady\nhand of the chief, dashed through a narrow gorge. Eddies broke\nviolently against numerous small islands, which rendered navigation\nexceeding dangerous. Never could it be more hazardous to capsize, for\nthe banks afforded no refuge, and whoever had set foot on the porous\ncrust of the shore would probably have perished. At this point the\nriver flowed between warm springs, oxide of iron colored the muddy\nground a brilliant red, and not a yard of firm earth could be seen.\nThe air was heavy with a penetrating sulphureous odor. The natives did\nnot regard it, but the captives were seriously annoyed by the noxious\nvapors exhaled from the fissures of the soil and the bubbles that\nburst and discharged their gaseous contents. Yet, however disagreeable\nthese emanations were, the eye could not but admire this magnificent\nspectacle.\n\n[Illustration: At this point the river flowed between warm springs, and\nnot a yard of firm earth could be seen.]\n\nThe canoes soon after entered a dense cloud of white smoke, whose\nwreaths rose in gradually decreasing circles above the river. On the\nshores a hundred geysers, some shooting forth masses of vapor, and\nothers overflowing in liquid columns, varied their effects, like the\njets and cascades of a fountain. It seemed as though some engineer was\ndirecting at his pleasure the outflowings of these springs, as the\nwaters and vapor, mingling in the air, formed rainbows in the sunbeams.\n\nFor two miles the canoes glided within this vapory atmosphere,\nenveloped in its warm waves that rolled along the surface of the water.\nThen the sulphureous smoke disappeared, and a pure swift current of\nfresh air refreshed the panting voyagers. The region of the springs was\npassed. Before the cl"}, {"chunk_id": 195, "text": "or were beating time to a\nfuneral dirge, a great concert of cries, groans, and sobs arose on the\nair. They mourned the dead in plaintive and modulated cadences. His\nrelations struck their heads together; his kinswomen lacerated their\nfaces with their nails, and showed themselves more lavish of blood than\nof tears. These unfortunate females conscientiously fulfilled their\nbarbarous duty.\n\nBut these demonstrations were not enough to appease the soul of the\ndeceased, whose wrath would doubtless have smitten the survivors of his\ntribe; and his warriors, as they could not recall him to life, wished\nthat he should have no cause to regret in the other world the happiness\nof this.\n\nKara-Tété's wife was not to forsake her husband in the tomb. Moreover,\nthe unfortunate woman would not have been allowed to survive him;\nit was the custom, in accordance with duty, and examples of such\nsacrifices are not wanting in New Zealand history. The woman appeared.\nShe was still young. Her hair floated in disorder over her shoulders.\nVague words, lamentations, and broken phrases, in which she celebrated\nthe virtues of the dead, interrupted her groans; and, in a final\nparoxysm of grief, she stretched herself at the foot of the mound,\nbeating the ground with her head.\n\nAt this moment Kai-Koumou approached her. Suddenly the unfortunate\nvictim rose; but a violent blow with the \"méré,\" a formidable club,\nwielded by the hand of the chief, struck her lifeless to the earth.\n\n[Sidenote: POOR HUMANITY!]\n\nFrightful cries at once broke forth. A hundred arms threatened the\ncaptives, who trembled at the horrible sight. But no one stirred, for\nthe funeral ceremonies were not ended.\n\nKara-Tété's wife had joined her husband in the other world. Both bodies\nlay side by side. But for the eternal life his faithful spouse could\nnot alone suffice the deceased. Who would serve them in presence of\nNouï-Atoua, if their slaves did not follow them?\n\nSix unfortunates were brought before the corpse of their master and\nmistress. They were servants, whom the pitiless laws of war had reduced\nto slavery. During the life of the chief they had undergone the\nseverest privations, suffered a thousand abuses, had been scantily fed,\nand compelled constantly to labor like beasts; and now, according to\nthe Maori belief, they were to continue their existence of servitude\nfor eternity.\n\nThey appeared to be resigned to their fate, and were not astonished\nat a sacrifice they had long anticipated. Their freedom from all\nbonds showed that they would meet death unresistingly. Moreover, this\ndeath was rapid, protracted sufferings were spared them. These were\nreserved for the captives who stood trembling not twenty paces distant.\nSix blows of the méré, given by six stalwart warriors, stretched the\nvictims on the ground in a pool of blood. It was the signal for a\nterrible scene of cannibalism, which followed in all its horrible\ndetails.\n\nGlenarvan and his companions, breathless with fright, strove to hide\nthis awful scene from the eyes of the two unhappy ladies. They now\nunderstood what awaited them at sunrise the next day, and what cruel\ntortures would doubtless precede such a death. They were dumb with\nhorror.\n\nThe funeral dance now began. Strong spirits, extracted from an\nindigenous plant, maddened the savages till they seemed no longer\nhuman. Would they not forget the taboo of the chief, and throw\nthemselves in their final outbreaks upon the prisoners who trembled at\ntheir frenzy?\n\n[Illustration: A terrible scene of cannibalism, which followed in all\nits horrible details.]\n\n[Illustration: The corpses, folded together, in a sitting posture,\nand tied in their clothes by a girdle of withes, were placed on this\nprimitive bier.]\n\nBut Kai-Koumou had preserved his reason in the midst of the general\nintoxication.

Our scheme has succeeded! My dear Helena, my brave\ncompanions, we are now dead and buried; but this evening we will\nrevive, we will leave our tomb, and flee from these barbarous tribes!\"\n\nIt would be difficult to describe the joy that reigned within the\npalisade. Hope had reanimated all hearts. These courageous travelers\nforgot their past trials, dreaded not the future, and only rejoiced in\ntheir present deliverance; although very little reflection would show\nhow difficult was the task of reaching an European settlement from\ntheir present position. But if Kai-Koumou was outwitted, they believed\nthemselves safe from all the savages of New Zealand.\n\nA whole day must pass before the decisive attempt could be made, and\nthey employed their time in arranging a plan of escape. Paganel had\npreserved his map of New Zealand, and could therefore search out the\nsafest routes.\n\nAfter some discussion, the fugitives resolved to proceed eastward\ntowards the Bay of Plenty. This course would lead them through\ndistricts that were very rarely visited. The travelers, who were\nalready accustomed to overcoming natural difficulties, only feared\nmeeting the Maoris. They therefore determined to avoid them at all\nhazards, and gain the eastern coast, where the missionaries have\nfounded several establishments. Moreover, this portion of the island\nhad hitherto escaped the ravages of the war and the depredations of the\nnatives. As for the distance that separated Lake Taupo from the Bay of\nPlenty, it could not be more than one hundred miles. Ten days would\nsuffice for the journey. The missions once reached, they could rest\nthere, and wait for some favorable opportunity of gaining Auckland,\ntheir destination.\n\nThese points being settled, they continued to watch the savages till\nevening. Not one of them remained at the foot of the mountain, and\nwhen darkness invaded the valleys of the lake, no fire betokened the\npresence of the Maoris at the base of the peak. The coast was clear.\n\nAt nine o'clock it was dark night, and Glenarvan gave the signal for\ndeparture. His companions and he, armed and equipped at Kara-Tété's\nexpense, began to cautiously descend the slopes of the Maunganamu.\nCaptain Mangles and Wilson led the way, with eyes and ears on the\nalert. They stopped at the least sound,--they examined the faintest\nlight; each slid down the declivity, the better to elude detection.\n\nTwo hundred feet below the summit, Captain Mangles and his sailor\nreached the dangerous ridge that had been so obstinately guarded by the\nnatives. If, unfortunately, the Maoris, more crafty than the fugitives,\nhad feigned a retreat to entice them within reach, if they had not\nbeen deceived by the eruption, their presence would be discovered\nat this point. Glenarvan, in spite of his confidence and Paganel's\npleasantries, could not help trembling. The safety of his friends was\nat stake during the few moments necessary to cross the ridge. He felt\nLady Helena's heart beat as she clung to his arm.\n\nBut neither he nor Captain Mangles thought of retreating. The young\ncaptain, followed by the others, and favored by the dense obscurity,\ncrawled along the narrow path, only stopping when some detached stone\nrolled to the base of the mountain. If the savages were still in\nambush, these unusual sounds would provoke from each side a formidable\nvolley.\n\nHowever, in gliding like serpents along this inclined crest, the\nfugitives could not advance rapidly. When Captain Mangles had gained\nthe lowest part, scarcely twenty-five feet sep"}, {"chunk_id": 194, "text": "\nshoulders and surveyed the fortification. No native was seen; only the\nsentinels guarded in turn at the door of their prison.\n\nBut on the third day the huts were opened. The savages, men, women,\nand children, to the number of several hundreds, assembled in the pah,\nsilent and calm. Kai-Koumou came out of his house, and, surrounded by\nthe principal warriors of his tribe, took his place on a mound several\nfeet high in the centre of the fortification. The crowd of natives\nformed a semicircle around him, and the whole assembly preserved\nabsolute silence.\n\nAt a sign from the chief, a warrior advanced towards the temple.\n\n\"Remember!\" said Lady Helena to her husband.\n\nGlenarvan clasped his wife to his heart. At this moment Mary Grant\napproached John Mangles.\n\n\"Lord and Lady Glenarvan,\" said she, \"I think that, if a wife can die\nby the hand of her husband to escape a degrading existence, a maiden\ncan likewise die by the hand of her lover. John (for I may tell you\nat this critical moment), have I not long been your betrothed in the\ndepths of your heart? May I rely upon you, dear John, as Lady Helena\ndoes upon Lord Glenarvan?\"\n\n\"Mary!\" cried the young captain, in terror. \"Ah! dear Mary----\"\n\nHe could not finish: the mat was raised, and the captives were dragged\ntowards Kai-Koumou. The two women were resigned to their fate, while\nthe men concealed their anguish beneath a calmness that showed\nsuperhuman self-control. They came before the chief, who did not delay\nsentence.\n\n\"You killed Kara-Tété!\" said he to Glenarvan.\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n[Sidenote: THE BEGINNING OF THE END.]\n\n\"You shall die to-morrow at sunrise.\"\n\n\"Alone?\" inquired Glenarvan, whose heart beat quickly.\n\n\"What! as if our Tohonga's life were not more precious than yours!\"\ncried Kai-Koumou, whose eyes expressed a fierce regret.\n\nAt this moment a commotion took place among the natives. Glenarvan cast\na rapid glance around him. The crowd opened, and a warrior, dripping\nwith sweat and overcome with fatigue, appeared.\n\nAs soon as Kai-Koumou perceived him, he said in English, evidently that\nhe might be understood by the captives:\n\n\"You come from the camp of the pale-faces?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the Maori.\n\n\"You saw the prisoner, our Tohonga?\"\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n\"Is he living?\"\n\n\"He is dead! The English have shot him.\"\n\nThe fate of Glenarvan and his companions was settled.\n\n\"You shall all die to-morrow at daybreak!\" cried Kai-Koumou.\n\nThe unfortunates were therefore to suffer a common death. Lady Helena\nand Mary Grant raised towards heaven a look of thankfulness.\n\nThe captives were not taken back to the temple. They were to attend\nthat day the funeral of the dead chief, and the bloody ceremonies\nconnected therewith. A party of natives conducted them to the foot of\nan enormous koudi, where these guardians remained without losing sight\nof their prisoners. The rest of the tribe, absorbed in their official\nmourning, seemed to have forgotten them.\n\nThe customary three days had elapsed since the death of Kara-Tété. The\nsoul of the deceased had therefore forever abandoned its mortal abode.\nThe sacred rites began.\n\nThe body was carried to a small mound in the centre of the\nfortification, clothed in splendid costume, and enveloped in a\nmagnificent flaxen mat. The head was adorned with plumes, and wore a\ncrown of green leaves. The face, arms, and breast had been rubbed with\noil, and therefore showed no mortification.\n\nThe parents and friends of the deceased came to the foot of the\nmound, and all at once, as if some director were beating time to a\nfuneral dirge, a great concert of cries, groans, and sobs arose on the\nair. They mourned the dead in plaintive and modulated cadences. His\nrelations struck their heads together; his kinswomen lacerated their\nfaces with their nails, and showed themselves more lavish of blood than\nof tears.

They dug a sort of\ngroove for it down the side of the mountain, that it might slide on an\ninclined plane.\n\nAs their action increased, the trembling of the earth became more\nviolent. Hollow rumblings and hissings sounded under the thin\ncrust. But the bold experimenters, like real Vulcans, governing the\nunderground fires, worked on in silence. Several cracks and a few gusts\nof hot smoke warned them that their position was becoming dangerous.\nBut a final effort detached the block, which glided down the slope of\nthe mountain and disappeared.\n\nThe thin covering at once yielded. An incandescent column poured forth\ntowards the sky with loud explosions, while streams of boiling water\nand lava rolled towards the encampment of the natives and the valleys\nbelow. The whole peak trembled, and you might almost have thought that\nit was disappearing in a general conflagration.\n\nGlenarvan and his companions had scarcely time to escape the shock of\nthe eruption. They fled to the inclosure of the tomb, but not without\nreceiving a few scalding drops of the water, which bubbled and exhaled\na strong sulphureous odor.\n\nThen mud, lava, and volcanic fragments mingled in the scene of\ndevastation. Torrents of flame furrowed the sides of the Maunganamu.\nThe adjoining mountains glowed in the light of the eruption, and the\ndeep valleys were illumined with a vivid brightness.\n\nThe savages were soon aroused, both by the noise and the heat\nof the lava that flowed in a scalding tide through the midst of\ntheir encampment. Those whom the fiery flood had not reached fled,\nand ascended the surrounding hills, turning and gazing back at\nthis terrific phenomenon, with which their god, in his wrath, had\noverwhelmed the desecrators of the sacred mountain; while at certain\nmoments they were heard howling their consecratory cry:\n\n\"Taboo! taboo! taboo!\"\n\n[Illustration: The fugitives made themselves levers out of the stakes\nof the tomb.]\n\n[Illustration: An incandescent column poured forth towards the sky with\nloud explosions, while streams of boiling water and lava rolled towards\nthe encampment of the natives.]\n\nMeantime an enormous quantity of vapor, melted stones, and lava had\nescaped from the crater. It was no longer a simple geyser. All this\nvolcanic effervescence had hitherto been confined beneath the crust of\nthe peak, since the outlets of Tangariro sufficed for its expansion;\nbut as a new opening had been made, it had rushed forth with extreme\nviolence.\n\nAll night long, during the storm that raged above and below, the peak\nwas shaken with a commotion that could not but alarm Glenarvan. The\nprisoners, concealed behind the palisade of the tomb, watched the\nfearful progress of the outbreak.\n\nMorning came. The fury of the volcano had not moderated. Thick,\nyellowish vapors mingled with the flames, and torrents of lava poured\nin every direction. Glenarvan, with eye alert and beating heart,\nglanced between the interstices of the inclosure, and surveyed the camp\nof the Maoris.\n\nThe natives had fled to the neighboring plateaus, beyond the reach of\nthe volcano. Several corpses, lying at the foot of the peak, had been\ncharred by the fire. Farther on, towards the pah, the lava had consumed\na number of huts, that were still smoking. The savages, in scattered\ngroups, were gazing at the vapory summit of Maunganamu with religious\nawe.\n\nKai-Koumou came into the midst of his warriors, and Glenarvan\nrecognized him.

The Patagonian took two steps forward;\nGlenarvan took his hand, and pressed it. There was in the latter's\nlook, in his physiognomy, such a feeling, such an expression of\ngratitude, that the native could not mistake it. He inclined his head\ngently, and uttered a few words that neither the major nor his friend\ncould understand.\n\nThe Patagonian, after regarding the strangers attentively, now changed\nthe language; but whatever it was, this new idiom was no better\nunderstood than the first. However, certain expressions which he used\nstruck Glenarvan.

Their arms and ammunition were in the hands of\nthe savages, and their own bullets would have quickly stretched them on\nthe earth had they attempted to escape.\n\nThey were not long in learning, by the aid of a few English words which\nthe natives used, that, being driven back by the British troops, they\nwere returning, vanquished and weakened, to the regions of the upper\nWaikato. Their chief, after an obstinate resistance, in which he lost\nhis principal warriors, was now on his way to rouse again the river\ntribes. He was called Kai-Koumou, a terrible name, which signified\nin the native language \"he who eats the limbs of his enemy.\" He was\nbrave and bold, but his cruelty equaled his bravery. No pity could be\nexpected from him. His name was well known to the English soldiers, and\na price had been set upon his head by the governor of New Zealand.\n\nThis terrible catastrophe had come upon Glenarvan just as he was\nabout reaching the long-desired harbor of Auckland, whence he would\nhave returned to his native country. Yet, looking at his calm and\npassionless countenance, you could not have divined the depth of his\nanguish, for in his present critical situation he did not betray the\nextent of his misfortunes. He felt that he ought to set an example of\nfortitude to his wife and his companions, as being the husband and\nchief. Moreover, he was ready to die first for the common safety, if\ncircumstances should require it.\n\n[Sidenote: CHIEFS, CIVILIZED AND UNCIVILIZED.]\n\nHis companions were worthy of him; they shared his noble thoughts, and\ntheir calm and haughty appearance would scarcely have intimated that\nthey were being carried away to captivity and suffering. By common\nconsent, at Glenarvan's suggestion, they had resolved to feign a proud\nindifference in the presence of the savages. It was the only way of\ninfluencing those fierce natures.\n\n[Illustration: A boat might have been seen ascending the Waikato. It\nwas a canoe seventy feet long and five broad.]\n\nSince leaving the encampment, the natives, taciturn like all savages,\nhad scarcely spoken to each other. However, from a few words exchanged,\nGlenarvan perceived that they were acquainted with the English\nlanguage. He therefore resolved to question the chief in regard to the\nfate that was in store for them. Addressing Kai-Koumou, he said, in a\nfearless tone:\n\n\"Where are you taking us, chief?\"\n\nKai-Koumou gazed at him coldly without answering.\n\n\"Say, what do you expect to do with us?\" continued Glenarvan.\n\nThe chief's eyes blazed with a sudden light, and in a stern voice he\nreplied:\n\n\"To exchange you, if your friends will ransom you; to kill you, if they\nrefuse.\"\n\nGlenarvan asked no more, but hope returned to his heart. Doubtless,\nsome chiefs of the Maori tribe had fallen into the hands of the\nEnglish, and the natives would attempt to recover them by way of\nexchange; their situation, therefore, was not one for despair.\n\nMeantime the canoe rapidly ascended the river. Paganel, whose\nchangeable disposition carried him from one extreme to another, had\nregained his hopefulness. He believed that the Maoris were sparing them\nthe fatigue of their journey to the English settlements, a"}, {"chunk_id": 172, "text": "captain seized the sailor's hand.\n\n\"The surf!\" said he.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Wilson. \"The sea is breaking on the reefs.\"\n\n\"Not more than two cable-lengths distant.\"\n\n\"Not more! The shore is here!\"\n\nCaptain Mangles leaned over the railing, gazed at the dark waves, and\ncried:\n\n\"The sounding-lead, Wilson!\"\n\nThe skipper, who was in the forecastle, did not seem to suspect his\nsituation. Wilson grasped the sounding-line, which lay coiled in its\npail, and rushed into the port-shrouds. He cast the lead; the rope\nslipped between his fingers; at the third knot it stopped.\n\n\"Three fathoms!\" cried Wilson.\n\n\"We are on the breakers!\" shouted the sober captain to the stupefied\none.\n\nWhether the former saw Halley shrug his shoulders or not is of little\nconsequence. At all events, he rushed towards the wheel and crowded\nthe helm hard alee, while Wilson, letting go the line, hauled upon the\ntop-sail yard-arms to luff the ship. The sailor who was steering, and\nhad been forcibly pushed aside, did not at all understand this sudden\nattack.\n\n\"To the port-yards! let loose the sails!\" cried the young captain,\nmanaging so as to escape the reefs.\n\nFor half a minute, the starboard side of the brig grazed the rocks,\nand, in spite of the darkness, John perceived a roaring line of\nbreakers that foamed a few yards from the ship.\n\n[Sidenote: VERY CRITICAL CIRCUMSTANCES.]\n\nAt this moment Will Halley, becoming conscious of the imminent danger,\nlost his presence of mind. His sailors, who were scarcely sober,\ncould not comprehend his orders. Moreover, his incoherent words and\ncontradictory commands showed that this stupid drunkard's coolness\nhad failed. He was surprised by the nearness of the land, which was\nonly eight miles off, when he thought it thirty or forty. The currents\nhad taken him unawares, and thrown him out of his ordinary course.\n\n[Illustration: The sailor who was steering, and had been forcibly\npushed aside, did not at all understand this sudden attack.]\n\nHowever, Captain Mangles's prompt management had rescued the brig from\nher peril; but he did not know his position. Perhaps he was inclosed by\na chain of reefs. The wind blew fresh from the east, and at every pitch\nthey might strike bottom.\n\nThe roar of the surf was soon redoubled, and it was necessary to luff\nstill more. John crowded the helm down and braced farther to leeward.\nThe breakers multiplied beneath the prow of the ship, and they were\nobliged to tack so as to put to sea. Would this manoeuvre succeed with\nsuch an unsteady vessel, and under such reduced sail? It was uncertain,\nbut as their only chance they must venture it.\n\n\"Hard alee!\" cried Captain Mangles to Wilson.\n\nThe Macquarie began to approach the new line of reefs. Soon the\nwater foamed above the submerged rocks. It was a moment of torturing\nsuspense. The spray glittered on the crests of the waves. You would\nhave thought a phosphorescent glow had suddenly illumined the water.\nWilson and Mulready forced down the wheel with their whole weight.\n\nSuddenly a shock was felt. The vessel had struck upon a rock. The\nbob-stays broke, and nearly overthrew the mainmast. Could they come\nabout without any other injury? No; for all at once there was a calm,\nand the ship veered to windward again, and her movements suddenly\nceased. A lofty wave seized and bore her forward towards the reefs,\nwhile she rolled heavily. The mainmast went by the board with all its\nrigging, the brig heaved twice and was motionless, leaning over to\nstarboard. The pump-lights were shattered in pieces, and the passengers\nrushed to the deck; but the waves were sweeping it from one end to\nthe other, and they could not remain without danger. Captain Mangles,\nknowing that the ship was firmly imbedded in the sand, besought them\nfor their own sakes to go below again.\n\n\"The truth, John?\" asked Glenarvan, faintly.\n\n\"The truth, my lord, is that we shall not founder. As for being\ndestroyed by the sea, that is another question; but we have time to\ntake counsel.\"\n\n\"Is it midnight?\"\n\n\"Yes,"}, {"chunk_id": 71, "text": "lighted! Welcome, welcome! I am almost a Frenchman,\"\ncried the commander, shaking the geographer's arm with rather painful\nviolence.\n\n\"One of your friends?\" asked the major of Paganel.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied he, with national pride; \"we have friends in all parts\nof the world!\"\n\n[Illustration: \"Ah, I am delighted! Welcome, welcome! I am almost a\nFrenchman,\" cried the commander, shaking the geographer's arm with\nrather painful violence.]\n\n[Sidenote: RAISING A REGIMENT.]\n\nHe then entered into conversation with the commander. Glenarvan would\ngladly have put in a word in regard to his affairs, but the soldier\nwas telling his story, and was not in the mood to be interrupted.\nThis honest man had left France a long time before; and the native\nlanguage was no longer perfectly familiar to him: he had forgotten,\nif not words, at least the manner of combining them. As his visitors\nsoon learned, he had been a sergeant in the French army. Since the\nfoundation of the fort he had not left it, and commanded it by\nappointment from the Argentine government. He was by parentage a\nBasque, and his name was Manuel Ipharaguerre. A year after his arrival\nin the country, Sergeant Manuel was naturalized, joined the Argentine\narmy, and married an honest Indian woman, who had twins,--boys, to be\nsure, for the sergeant's worthy consort would never present him with\ndaughters. Manuel did not think of any other calling than that of the\nsoldier, and hoped, in time, with the help of God, to offer to the\nrepublic a whole battalion of young soldiers.\n\n\"You have seen them?\" said he. \"Charming fellows! Good soldiers! José!\nJuan! Miguel! Pepe! Pepe is only seven years old, and is already biting\nhis cartridge!\"\n\nPepe, hearing himself complimented, joined his two little feet, and\npresented arms with perfect precision.\n\n\"He will do!\" added the sergeant. \"He will be a major--or\nbrigadier-general one day!\"\n\nThis story lasted a quarter of an hour, to Thalcave's great\nastonishment. The Indian could not understand how so many words could\ncome from a single throat. No one interrupted the commander; and even\na French sergeant had to conclude at last, though not without forcing\nhis guests to accompany him to his dwelling. Here they were introduced\nto Madame Ipharaguerre, who appeared to be \"a good-looking person,\" if\nthis expression may be employed in regard to an Indian.\n\nWhen he had exhausted himself, the sergeant asked his guests to what he\nowed the honor of their visit. And now it was their turn to explain.\n\nPaganel, opening the conversation in French, told him of their journey\nacross the Pampas, and ended by asking why the Indians had abandoned\nthe country.\n\n\"War!\" replied the sergeant.\n\n\"War?\"\n\n\"Yes, civil war.\"\n\n\"Civil war?\" rejoined Paganel.\n\n\"Yes, war between Paraguay and Buenos Ayres,\" answered the sergeant.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Why, all the Indians of the north are in the rear of General Flores,\nand those of the plains are plundering.\"\n\n\"But the caziques?\"\n\n\"The caziques with them.\"\n\nThis answer was reported to Thalcave, who shook his head. Indeed,\nhe either did not know, or had forgotten, that a civil war, which\nwas afterwards to involve Brazil, was decimating two-thirds of the\nrepublic. The Indians had everything to gain in these internal\nstruggles, and could not neglect such fine opportunities for plunder.\nThe sergeant, therefore, was not mistaken in attributing this desertion\nof the Pampas to the civil war that was being waged in the northern\npart of the Argentine Provinces.\n\nBut this event disconcerted Glenarvan's hopes. If Captain Grant was\na prisoner of the caziques, he must have been carried by them to the\nnorthern frontiers. Yet how and where to find him? Must they attempt\na perilous and almost useless search to the northern limits of the\nPampas? It was a serious matter, which was to be earnestly considered.\n\nHowever, one important question was still to be asked of the sergeant,\nand the major thought of this, while his companions were looking at\neach other in silence.\n\n\"Hav"}, {"chunk_id": 236, "text": "he plan of founding a Scottish\ncolony on the shores washed by the Pacific Ocean.\n\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK 46597 ***\n"}]}

No one, however, thought of reproaching him for so\nexcusable an error.\n\nThey returned to the encampment, saddened indeed. Still, not one of\nthe courageous and devoted men regretted so many hardships uselessly\nendured, so many dangers vainly incurred. But each saw all hope of\nsuccess annihilated in an instant. Could they find Captain Grant\nbetween Tandil and the sea? No. If any prisoner had fallen into the\nhands of the Indians on the Atlantic coast, Sergeant Manuel would\ncertainly have been informed. An event of such a nature could not\nhave escaped the natives who trade from Tandil to Carmen. Among the\ntraders of the Argentine Plains everything is known and reported. There\nwas therefore but one course now to take,--to join, without delay, the\nDuncan at Cape Medano, the appointed rendezvous.\n\n[Illustration: More than once during the journey, the attention and\ninterest of all, but especially of Paganel, were arrested by the\ncurious illusion of the mirage.]\n\nIn the meantime, Paganel had asked Glenarvan for the document, by\nrelying on which their search had resulted so unfortunately. He\nread it again with unconcealed vexation, seeking to discover a new\ninterpretation.\n\n\"This document is, at all events, clear,\" said Glenarvan. \"It explains\nin the most definite manner the shipwreck of the captain and the place\nof his captivity.\"\n\n\"No,\" replied the geographer, stamping with his foot, \"a hundred times\nno! Since Captain Grant is not on the Pampas, he is not in America.\nThis document ought to tell where he is; and it shall, my friends, or I\nam no longer Jacques Paganel.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII.\n\nTHE FLOOD.\n\n\n[Sidenote: OMENS AND MIRAGES.]\n\nFort Independence is one hundred and fifty miles from the shores of\nthe Atlantic. But for unforeseen and unexpected delays, Glenarvan\ncould have rejoined the Duncan in four days. He could not, however,\nreconcile himself to the idea of returning on board without Captain\nGrant, and failing so completely in his search; and did not therefore,\nas usual, give the orders for departure. But the major assumed the\ntask of saddling the horses, renewing the provisions, and making his\narrangements for the journey. Thanks to his activity, the little party,\nat eight o'clock in the morning, was on its way down the grassy slopes\nof the Tandil Sierra.\n\nGlenarvan, with Robert at his side, galloped on in silence. His\nlordship's bold and resolute character did not permit him to accept\nthis disappointment calmly. His heart beat violently, and his brain was\non fire. Paganel, tormented by the mystery of the document, arranged\nthe words in every way, as if to draw from them a new meaning. Thalcave\nsilently resigned himself to Thaouka's sagacity. The major, always\nconfident, performed his duties like a man upon whom discouragement can\nhave no effect. Tom Austin and his two sailors shared their master's\nannoyance. Once, when a timid hare crossed the path in front of them,\nthe superstitious Scotchmen gazed at one another.\n\n\"A bad omen,\" said Wilson.\n\n\"Yes, in the Highlands,\" replied Mulready.\n\n\"What is bad in the Highlands is no better here,\" added Wilson,\nsententiously.\n\nAbout noon the travelers had descended the mountains and gained the\nundulating plains that extend to the sea; the boundless prairie spread\nits broad carpet of verdure before them.\n\nMore than once during the journey the attention and interest of all,\nbut especially of Paganel, were arrested by the curious illusion of\nthe mirage, by which was presented in the sky, at the limits of the\nhorizon, a semblance of the estancias, the poplars and willows near\nthem, and other objects; the images being so much like the reality that\nit required a strong effort to realize their deceptive character.\n\nThe weather hitherto had been fine, but now the sky assumed a less\npleasing aspect.

Paganel,\nexcited and scarcely finding his words, resumed these interesting\ninterrogatories, while his eyes, fixed upon the grave Indian, strove\nto anticipate his reply before it issued from his lips. Every word the\nPatagonian said he repeated in English, so that his companions heard\nthe Indian speak, as it were, in their own language.\n\n\"And this prisoner?\" inquired Paganel.\n\n\"He was a stranger,\" replied Thalcave slowly; \"a European.\"\n\n\"You have seen him?\"\n\n\"No, but he is mentioned in the accounts of the Indians. He was a brave\nman.\"\n\n\"You understand, my friends,\" said Paganel; \"a courageous man!\"\n\n\"My father!\" cried Robert Grant.\n\nThen, addressing Paganel:\n\n\"How do you say 'It is my father,' in Spanish?\" he asked.\n\n\"_Es mio padre_,\" answered the geographer.\n\nImmediately Robert, taking Thalcave's hands, said in a sweet voice,--\n\n\"_Es mio padre!_\"\n\n\"_Suo padre!_\" replied the Patagonian, whose look brightened.\n\nHe took the boy in his arms, lifted him from his horse, and gazed at\nhim with the most curious sympathy. His intelligent countenance became\nsuffused with a peaceful emotion.\n\nBut Paganel had not finished his inquiries. Where was this prisoner?\nWhat was he doing? When had Thalcave heard of him? All these questions\nthronged his mind at once. He did not have to wait long for answers,\nbut learnt that the European was a slave of one of the Indian tribes\nthat scour the plains.\n\n\"But where was he last?\" asked Paganel.\n\n\"With the cazique Calfoucoura,\" answered Thalcave.\n\n\"On the line we have been following?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And who is this cazique?\"\n\n\"The chief of the Poyuches Indians; a man with two tongues and two\nhearts.\"\n\n[Sidenote: A SCIENTIFIC BATH.]\n\n\"That is to say, false in word and in deed,\" said Paganel, after\ntranslating to his companions this beautiful metaphor of the Indian\nlanguage. \"And can we rescue our friend?\" he added.\n\n\"Perhaps so, if your friend is still in the hands of the Indians.\"\n\n\"And when did you hear of him?\"\n\n\"A long time ago, and, since then, the sun has brought back two summers\nto the sky.\"\n\nGlenarvan's joy could not be described. This answer coincided exactly\nwith the date of the document. But one question remained to be asked.\n\n\"You speak of a prisoner,\" said Paganel; \"but were there not three?\"\n\n\"I do not know,\" replied Thalcave.\n\n\"And you know nothing of their actual situation?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\nThis last word ended the conversation. It was possible that the three\nprisoners had been separated a long time. But the substance of the\nPatagonian's information was that the Indians spoke of a European who\nhad fallen into their power. The date of his captivity, the place where\nhe must have been, everything, even to the Patagonian phrase used to\nexpress his courage, related evidently to Captain Harry Grant.\n\nTheir progress was now somewhat slow and difficult; their next object\nbeing to reach and cross the river Colorado, to w"}, {"chunk_id": 57, "text": "s meeting elicited different opinions. Glenarvan thought\nof the information that these natives might furnish concerning the\nshipwrecked seamen of the Britannia. Thalcave, for his part, scarcely\nenjoyed meeting in his journey the wandering Indians of the plains.\nHe considered them plunderers and robbers, and only sought to avoid\nthem. According to his orders, the little party collected together, and\nmade ready their fire-arms. It was necessary to be prepared for any\nemergency.\n\nThe Indian detachment was soon perceived. It consisted of only ten\nmen, which fact reassured the Patagonian. They approached within a\nhundred paces, so that they could be easily distinguished. Their high\nforeheads, prominent rather than receding, their tall forms, and their\nolive color, showed them to be magnificent types of the Indian race.\nThey were clad in the skins of guanacos, and carried various weapons of\nwar and the chase, while their dexterity in horsemanship was remarkable.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nHaving halted, they appeared to hold a conference, crying and\ngesticulating. Glenarvan advanced toward them; but he had not proceeded\ntwo yards, when the detachment wheeled about and disappeared with\nincredible swiftness. The tired horses of the travelers could never\nhave overtaken them.\n\n\"The cowards!\" cried Paganel.\n\n\"They fly too fast for honest men,\" said MacNabb.\n\n\"What are these Indians?\" inquired Paganel of Thalcave.\n\n\"Gauchos!\" replied the Patagonian.\n\n\"Gauchos!\" repeated Paganel, turning toward his companions, \"Gauchos!\nWe had no need, then, to take such precautions. There was nothing to\nfear!\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked the major.\n\n\"Because the Gauchos are inoffensive peasants.\"\n\n\"Do you think so, Paganel?\"\n\n\"Certainly. They took us for robbers, and fled.\"\n\nGlenarvan was quite disappointed in not speaking with them, as he\nexpected to obtain additional tidings of the lost sailors; but it\nwas necessary to push on, if they would reach their destination that\nevening.\n\nAt eight o'clock Thalcave, who had gone a little in advance, announced\nthat the lake so long desired was in sight. A quarter of an hour\nafterward the little party descended the high banks. But here a serious\ndisappointment awaited them,--the lake was dry!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\nIN SEARCH OF WATER.\n\n\nLake Salinas terminates the cluster of lagoons that adjoin the Ventana\nand Guamini mountains. Numerous expeditions are made to this place\nto obtain supplies of salt, with which these waters are strongly\nimpregnated. But now the water had evaporated under the heat of the\nsun, and the lake was only a vast glittering basin.\n\nWhen Thalcave announced the presence of a drinkable liquid at Lake\nSalinas, he meant the streams of fresh water that flow from it in\nmany places. But at this time its affluents were as dry as itself.\nThe burning sun had absorbed everything. Hence, the consternation was\ngeneral when the thirsty party arrived at the parched shores of Lake\nSalinas.\n\nIt was necessary to take counsel. The little water in the leathern\nbottles was half spoiled, and could not quench their thirst, which\nbegan to make itself acutely felt. Hunger and fatigue gave place to\nthis imperative want. A \"roukah,\" a kind of upright tent, of leather,\nwhich stood in a hollow, and had been abandoned by the natives, served\nas a refuge for the travelers, while their horses, stretched on the\nmuddy shores of the lake, ate the saline plants and dry reeds, although\nreluctantly.\n\nWhen each had sat down in the roukah, Paganel asked Thalcave's advice\nas to what was best to be done. A rapid conversation, of which\nGlenarvan caught a few words, ensued between the geographer and the\nIndian. Thalcave spoke calmly, while Paganel gesticulated for both.\nThis consultation lasted a few minutes, and then the Patagonian folded\nhis arms.\n\n\"What did he say?\" inquired Glenarvan. \"I thought I understood him to\nadvise us to separate.\"\n\n\"Yes, into two parties,\" replied Paganel. \"Those of us whose horses are\nso overcome with fatigue and thirst that they can "}, {"chunk_id": 77, "text": "fled away in the track of Thaouka.\n\nIt was time. Five miles to the south a high and broad wall of water\nwas rushing over the plain, which was fast becoming an ocean. The tall\ngrass disappeared as before the scythe, and the tufts of mimosas, torn\nup by the current, separated and formed floating islands. The mass of\nwaters spread itself in broad waves of irresistible power. The dikes of\nthe great rivers had evidently given way, and perhaps the waters of the\nColorado and Rio Negro were now mingling in a common stream.\n\nThe wall of water descried by Thalcave advanced with the speed of a\nrace-horse. The travelers fled before it like a cloud driven by the\nstorm. Their eyes sought in vain a place of refuge. Sky and water\nmingled together on the horizon. The horses, excited by the danger,\ndashed along in a mad gallop, so that their riders could scarcely keep\ntheir seats. Glenarvan frequently glanced behind him.\n\n\"The water is overtaking us,\" he thought.\n\n\"Quick! quick!\" cried Thalcave.\n\n[Sidenote: THE ARK.]\n\nThe unfortunate beasts were urged to a swifter pace. From their flanks,\nlacerated with the spur, flowed bright red streams, which marked\ntheir course on the water by long, crimson lines. They stumbled in\nthe hollows of the ground; they were entangled in the hidden grass;\nthey fell and rose again continually. The depth of the water sensibly\nincreased. Long surges announced the on-rush of the mass of water that\ntossed its foaming crests less than two miles distant.\n\nFor a quarter of an hour this final struggle against the most terrible\nof elements was prolonged. The fugitives could keep no account of the\ndistance they had traversed; but, judging by the rapidity of their\nflight, it must have been considerable.\n\nMeantime the horses, immersed to their breasts, could no longer\nadvance without extreme difficulty. Glenarvan, Paganel, Austin, all\nbelieved themselves lost, victims of the horrible death of unfortunates\nabandoned at sea. Their animals began to lose their footing; six feet\nof water was sufficient to drown them.\n\nWe must forbear to picture the acute anguish of these eight men\novertaken by a rising inundation. They felt their powerlessness to\nstruggle against these convulsions of nature, superior to human\nstrength. Their safety was no longer in their own hands.\n\nFive minutes after, the horses were swimming, while the current alone\ncarried them along with irresistible force and furious swiftness. All\nsafety seemed impossible, when the voice of the major was heard.\n\n\"A tree!\" said he.\n\n\"A tree!\" cried Glenarvan.\n\n\"Yes, yonder!\" replied Thalcave, and he pointed northward to a kind of\ngigantic walnut-tree, which rose solitary from the midst of the waters.\n\nHis companions had no need to be urged. This tree that was opportunely\npresented to them they must reach at all hazards. The horses probably\ncould not accomplish the distance; but the men, at least, could be\nsaved,--the current would carry them.\n\nAt that moment Tom Austin's horse gave a stifled neigh and disappeared.\nHis rider, extricating himself from the stirrups, began to swim\nvigorously.\n\n\"Cling to my saddle!\" cried Glenarvan to him.\n\n\"Thanks, my lord,\" replied he, \"my arms are strong.\"\n\n\"Your horse, Robert?\" continued Glenarvan, turning towards the boy.\n\n\"All right, my lord, all right! He swims like a fish.\"\n\n\"Attention!\" cried the major, in a loud voice.\n\nThis word was scarcely pronounced, when the enormous wall of water\nreached them. A huge wave, forty feet high, overwhelmed the fugitives\nwith a terrible roar. Men and beasts, everything, disappeared in a\nwhirlpool of foam. A ponderous liquid mass engulfed them in its furious\ntide. When the deluge had passed, the men regained the surface, and\nrapidly counted their numbers; but the horses, except Thaouka, had\ndisappeared forever.\n\n\"Courage! courage!\" cried Glenarvan, who supported Paganel with one arm\nand swam with the other.\n\n\"All right! all right!\" replied the worthy geographer; \"indeed I am not\nsorry----\"\n\nWhat was he not "}, {"chunk_id": 95, "text": "el, the major, Tom Austin, and the two sailors\nbade an affectionate adieu to the noble Patagonian, who clasped each\none in succession to his broad breast. All were sincerely sorry at\nparting with so courageous and devoted a friend. Paganel forced him\nto accept a map of South America and the two oceans, which the\nIndian had frequently examined with interest. It was the geographer's\nmost precious possession. As for Robert, he had nothing to give but\ncaresses, which he freely lavished upon his deliverer and upon Thaouka.\n\n[Illustration: They pushed off, and the boat was rapidly borne from the\nshore by the ebbing tide. For a long time the motionless outline of the\nIndian was seen through the foam of the waves.]\n\nAt that instant the Duncan's boat approached, and, gliding into the\nnarrow channel between the sand-banks, grounded on the beach.\n\n\"My wife?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"My sister?\" cried Robert.\n\n\"Lady Helena and Miss Grant await you on board,\" replied the cockswain.\n\"But we have not a moment to lose, my lord, for the tide is beginning\nto ebb.\"\n\nThe last acknowledgments were given, and Thalcave accompanied his\nfriends to the boat. Just as Robert was about to embark, the Indian\ntook him in his arms and gazed at him tenderly.\n\n\"Now go,\" said he; \"you are a man!\"\n\n\"Adieu, my friend, adieu!\" cried Glenarvan.\n\n\"Shall we ever see each other again?\" asked Paganel.\n\n\"Who knows?\" replied Thalcave, raising his arms towards heaven.\n\nThey pushed off, and the boat was rapidly borne from the shore by the\nebbing tide. For a long time the motionless outline of the Indian was\nseen through the foam of the waves. Then his tall form grew indistinct,\nand soon became invisible. An hour afterwards they reached the Duncan.\nRobert was the first to spring upon the deck, where he threw himself\nupon his sister's neck, while the crew of the yacht filled the air with\ntheir joyous shouts.\n\nThus had our travelers accomplished the journey across South America\non a rigorously straight line. Neither mountains nor rivers had turned\nthem aside from their course; and, although they were not forced to\nstruggle against the evil designs of men, the relentless fury of the\nelements had often tested their generous intrepidity to its utmost\npowers of endurance.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII.\n\nA NEW DESTINATION.\n\n\nThe first moments were consecrated to the happiness of meeting.\nLord Glenarvan did not wish the joy in the hearts of his friends to\nbe chilled by tidings of their want of success. His first words,\ntherefore, were,--\n\n\"Courage, my friends, courage! Captain Grant is not with us, but we are\nsure to find him.\"\n\nIt needed only such an assurance to restore hope to the passengers of\nthe Duncan. Lady Helena and Mary Grant, while the boat was approaching\nthe ship, had experienced all the anguish of suspense. From the deck\nthey endeavored to count those who were returning. At one time the\nyoung girl would despair; at another she would think she saw her\nfather. Her heart beat quickly; she could not speak; she could scarcely\nstand. Lady Helena supported her, while Captain Mangles stood beside\nher in silence. His keen eyes, accustomed to distinguish distant\nobjects, could not discern the captain.\n\n\"He is there! he is coming! my father!\" murmured the young girl.\n\nBut as the boat gradually drew near, the illusion vanished. Not only\nLady Helena and the captain, but Mary Grant, had now lost all hope. It\nwas, therefore, time for Glenarvan to utter his assuring words.\n\n[Sidenote: \"BREAKFAST!\"]\n\nAfter the first embraces, all were informed of the principal incidents\nof the journey; and, first of all, Glenarvan made known the new\ninterpretation of the document, due to the sagacity of Jacques Paganel.\nHe also praised Robert, of whom his sister had a right to be proud.\nHis courage, his devotion, and the dangers that he had overcome, were\nconspicuously set forth by his noble friend, so that the boy would not\nhave known where to hide himself, if his sister's arms had not afforded\nhim a sure refuge.\n\n[Il"}]}

The\ndanger was increasing every moment. Already the broken stakes were\nyielding to the teeth and claws of the wolves. But neither Glenarvan\nnor Thalcave appeared willing to yield. The Indian had drawn Glenarvan\ntowards the entrance of the inclosure. He pointed to the plain, now\nfree from wolves. In his animated language, he explained that not a\nmoment was to be lost; that the danger, if this plan failed, would be\ngreater for those who remained; in short, that he alone knew Thaouka\nwell enough to employ his marvelous agility and speed for the common\nsafety. Glenarvan blindly persisted in his resolve to sacrifice\nhimself, when suddenly he was pushed violently back. Thaouka pranced,\nreared on his hind legs, and all at once, with a spring, cleared the\nbarrier of fire and the rampart of bodies, while a boyish voice cried,--\n\n\"God save you, my lord!\"\n\nGlenarvan and Thalcave had scarcely time to perceive Robert, who,\nclinging to the horse's mane, disappeared in the darkness.\n\n\"Robert, unfortunate!\" cried Glenarvan.\n\nBut these words the Indian himself could not hear. Frightful howls\nresounded. The wolves, starting on the track of the horse, fled into\nthe darkness with a terrible speed.\n\nThalcave and Glenarvan rushed out of the ramada. Already the plain had\nresumed its tranquillity, and they could scarcely distinguish a moving\nline which undulated afar in the shadows of the night.\n\nGlenarvan sank upon the ground, overcome, in despair, clasping his\nhands. He gazed at Thalcave, who smiled with his accustomed calmness.\n\n\"Thaouka--good horse--brave child--he will be saved!\" he repeated,\nnodding his head.\n\n\"But if he falls?\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\"He will not fall!\"\n\nIn spite of Thalcave's confidence, his companion passed the night in\nterrible anguish. He was no longer even mindful of the danger still to\nbe feared from the wolves. He would have gone in search of Robert, but\nthe Indian restrained him, and explained that their horses could not\novertake the boy, that Thaouka must have distanced his enemies, and\ncould not be found in the darkness. They must wait for day to start in\nsearch of Robert.\n\nAt four o'clock in the morning day began to break. The mists of the\nhorizon were soon tinged with pale rays. A sparkling dew covered the\nplain, and the tall grass began to wave under the first breezes of the\ndawn.\n\nThe moment of departure had arrived.\n\n\"Forward!\" said the Indian.\n\nGlenarvan did not reply, but sprang upon Robert's horse, and the two\nwere soon galloping towards the west in the direction from which their\ncompanions were to come.\n\nFor an hour they traveled thus with great speed, gazing around for\nRobert, and dreading at each step to behold his mangled body. Glenarvan\ntortured the flanks of his horse with his spurs. Suddenly shots were\nheard, and reports at regular intervals, like signals for recognition.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"It is they!\" cried Glenarvan.\n\nThalcave and he urged their horses to a more rapid pace, and a few\nmoments afterwards they joined the party led by Paganel.\n\n[Sidenote: LIVELY GRATITUDE.]\n\nTo Glenarvan's joy, Robert was there, alive, borne by the noble\nThaouka, who neighed with pleasure at seeing his master.\n\n\"Ah, my boy! my boy!\" cried Glenarvan, with unspeakable tenderness; and\nRobert and he, dismounting, rushed into each other's arms.\n\nThen it was the Indian's turn to clasp to his breast the courageous son\nof Captain Grant.\n\n\"He lives! he lives!\" exclaimed Glenarvan.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Robert, \"thanks to Thaouka.\"\n\nThe Indian had not waited for these words of gratitude to embrace his\nhorse, but at that very moment he spoke to him and embraced him, as\nif human blood flowed in the veins of the noble animal. Then, turning\ntowards Paganel, he pointed to young Robert.\n\n\"A brave boy!\" said he.\n\nGlenarvan, however, asked, even while he admired the lad,--\n\n\"Why, my son, did you no"}, {"chunk_id": 51, "text": " Paganel, he did not leave the Indian. He became Thalcave's\nshadow, and could not remain quiet in the presence of a real\nPatagonian, in comparison with whom he would have passed for a dwarf.\nHe overwhelmed the grave Indian with Spanish phrases, to which the\nlatter quietly listened. The geographer studied this time without a\nbook, and was often heard repeating words aloud.\n\n\"If I do not get the accent,\" said he to the major, \"you must not be\nangry with me. Who would have thought that one day a Patagonian would\nteach me Spanish!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\nNEWS OF THE LOST CAPTAIN.\n\n\nAt eight o'clock the next morning Thalcave gave the signal for\ndeparture. The slope was gradual, and the travelers had only to descend\na gentle declivity to the sea.\n\nWhen the Patagonian declined the horse that Glenarvan offered him, the\nlatter thought that he preferred to go on foot, according to the custom\nof certain guides; and indeed, his long legs ought to have made walking\neasy. But he was mistaken.\n\nAt the moment of departure Thalcave whistled in a peculiar manner.\nImmediately a magnificent Argentine horse, of superb form, issued from\na small wood near by, and approached at the call of his master. The\nanimal was perfectly beautiful. His brown color indicated a sound,\nspirited and courageous beast. He had a small and elegantly poised\nhead, widely opening nostrils, a fiery eye, large hams, swelling\nwithers, broad breast, long pasterns, in short, all the qualities that\nconstitute strength and suppleness. The major, like a perfect horseman,\nadmired unreservedly this specimen of the horses of the plains. This\nbeautiful creature was called Thaouka, which means \"bird\" in the\nPatagonian language, and he justly merited this appellation.\n\n[Sidenote: A FRESH START.]\n\nWhen Thalcave was in the saddle, the horse pranced with spirited grace,\nand the Patagonian, a skillful rider, was magnificent to behold. His\noutfit comprised two weapons of the chase, the \"bolas\" and the lasso.\nThe bolas consists of three balls tied together by a leathern string,\nwhich are fastened to the front of the saddle. The Indians frequently\nthrow them the distance of a hundred paces at the animal or enemy that\nthey are pursuing, and with such precision that they twist about their\nlegs and bring them to the ground. It is, therefore, in their hands a\nformidable instrument, and they handle it with surprising dexterity.\nThe lasso, on the contrary, does not leave the hand that wields it. It\nconsists simply of a leathern thong thirty feet in length, terminating\nin a slip-noose which works upon an iron ring. The right hand throws\nthe slip-noose, while the left hand holds the remainder of the lasso,\nthe end of which is firmly tied to the saddle. A long carbine in a\nsling completed the Patagonian's armament.\n\nThalcave, without observing the admiration caused by his natural\ngrace, ease and courage, took the lead, and the party advanced, now\nat a gallop, and now at a walk, for their horses seemed entirely\nunaccustomed to trotting. Robert mounted with much boldness, and\nspeedily convinced Glenarvan of his ability to keep his seat.\n\nOn issuing from the gorges of the Andes, they encountered a great\nnumber of sand-ridges, called \"medanos,\" real waves incessantly\nagitated by the wind, when the roots of the herbage did not confine\nthem to the earth. This sand is of an extreme fineness; and, at the\nleast breath, they saw it float away in light clouds, or form regular\nsand-columns which rose to a considerable height. This spectacle caused\npleasure as well as annoyance to the eyes. Pleasure, for nothing was\nmore curious than these columns, wandering over the plain, struggling,\nmingling, sinking and rising in inexpressible confusion; and annoyance,\nsince an impalpable dust emanated from these innumerable medanos and\npenetrated the eyelids, however tightly they were closed.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThis phenomenon continued during a great part of the day. Nevertheless,\nthey advanced rapidly, and towards six o'clock the A"}, {"chunk_id": 77, "text": "fled away in the track of Thaouka.\n\nIt was time. Five miles to the south a high and broad wall of water\nwas rushing over the plain, which was fast becoming an ocean. The tall\ngrass disappeared as before the scythe, and the tufts of mimosas, torn\nup by the current, separated and formed floating islands. The mass of\nwaters spread itself in broad waves of irresistible power. The dikes of\nthe great rivers had evidently given way, and perhaps the waters of the\nColorado and Rio Negro were now mingling in a common stream.\n\nThe wall of water descried by Thalcave advanced with the speed of a\nrace-horse. The travelers fled before it like a cloud driven by the\nstorm. Their eyes sought in vain a place of refuge. Sky and water\nmingled together on the horizon. The horses, excited by the danger,\ndashed along in a mad gallop, so that their riders could scarcely keep\ntheir seats. Glenarvan frequently glanced behind him.\n\n\"The water is overtaking us,\" he thought.\n\n\"Quick! quick!\" cried Thalcave.\n\n[Sidenote: THE ARK.]\n\nThe unfortunate beasts were urged to a swifter pace. From their flanks,\nlacerated with the spur, flowed bright red streams, which marked\ntheir course on the water by long, crimson lines. They stumbled in\nthe hollows of the ground; they were entangled in the hidden grass;\nthey fell and rose again continually. The depth of the water sensibly\nincreased. Long surges announced the on-rush of the mass of water that\ntossed its foaming crests less than two miles distant.\n\nFor a quarter of an hour this final struggle against the most terrible\nof elements was prolonged. The fugitives could keep no account of the\ndistance they had traversed; but, judging by the rapidity of their\nflight, it must have been considerable.\n\nMeantime the horses, immersed to their breasts, could no longer\nadvance without extreme difficulty. Glenarvan, Paganel, Austin, all\nbelieved themselves lost, victims of the horrible death of unfortunates\nabandoned at sea. Their animals began to lose their footing; six feet\nof water was sufficient to drown them.\n\nWe must forbear to picture the acute anguish of these eight men\novertaken by a rising inundation. They felt their powerlessness to\nstruggle against these convulsions of nature, superior to human\nstrength. Their safety was no longer in their own hands.\n\nFive minutes after, the horses were swimming, while the current alone\ncarried them along with irresistible force and furious swiftness. All\nsafety seemed impossible, when the voice of the major was heard.\n\n\"A tree!\" said he.\n\n\"A tree!\" cried Glenarvan.\n\n\"Yes, yonder!\" replied Thalcave, and he pointed northward to a kind of\ngigantic walnut-tree, which rose solitary from the midst of the waters.\n\nHis companions had no need to be urged. This tree that was opportunely\npresented to them they must reach at all hazards. The horses probably\ncould not accomplish the distance; but the men, at least, could be\nsaved,--the current would carry them.\n\nAt that moment Tom Austin's horse gave a stifled neigh and disappeared.\nHis rider, extricating himself from the stirrups, began to swim\nvigorously.\n\n\"Cling to my saddle!\" cried Glenarvan to him.\n\n\"Thanks, my lord,\" replied he, \"my arms are strong.\"\n\n\"Your horse, Robert?\" continued Glenarvan, turning towards the boy.\n\n\"All right, my lord, all right! He swims like a fish.\"\n\n\"Attention!\" cried the major, in a loud voice.\n\nThis word was scarcely pronounced, when the enormous wall of water\nreached them. A huge wave, forty feet high, overwhelmed the fugitives\nwith a terrible roar. Men and beasts, everything, disappeared in a\nwhirlpool of foam. A ponderous liquid mass engulfed them in its furious\ntide. When the deluge had passed, the men regained the surface, and\nrapidly counted their numbers; but the horses, except Thaouka, had\ndisappeared forever.\n\n\"Courage! courage!\" cried Glenarvan, who supported Paganel with one arm\nand swam with the other.\n\n\"All right! all right!\" replied the worthy geographer; \"indeed I am not\nsorry----\"\n\nWhat was he not "}, {"chunk_id": 59, "text": "onfided to the\nsagacity of the geographer.\n\n[Sidenote: THE YOUNG SAILOR ON HORSEBACK.]\n\nThalcave was right in first proceeding towards the Guamini, since this\nstream lay on the prescribed course, and was the nearest. The three\nhorses galloped briskly forward. These excellent beasts perceived,\ndoubtless, by instinct, whither their masters were guiding them.\nThaouka, especially, showed a spirit that neither fatigue nor thirst\ncould overcome. The other horses followed, at a slower pace, but\nincited by his example.\n\nThe Patagonian frequently turned his head to look at Robert Grant, and,\nseeing the young boy firm and erect, in an easy and graceful position,\ntestified his satisfaction by a word of encouragement.\n\n\"Bravo, Robert!\" said Glenarvan. \"Thalcave seems to congratulate you.\nHe praises you, my boy!\"\n\n\"And why, my lord?\"\n\n\"Because of the way you ride.\"\n\n\"Oh, I merely keep firm; that is all,\" replied Robert, who blushed with\npleasure at hearing himself complimented.\n\n\"That is the main point, Robert,\" said Glenarvan; \"but you are too\nmodest, and I am sure you cannot fail to become an accomplished\nequestrian.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Robert, \"but what will papa say, who wishes to make a\nsailor of me?\"\n\n\"The one does not interfere with the other. If all horsemen do not make\ngood sailors, all sailors may certainly make good horsemen. To ride on\nthe yards, you must learn to keep yourself firm. As for knowing how to\nmanage your horse, that comes more easily.\"\n\n\"Poor father!\" exclaimed Robert; \"how he will thank you when you have\nfound him!\" And, so saying, he took his lordship's hand and pressed it\nto his lips.\n\n\"You love him well, Robert?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord; he was so kind to sister and me. He thought only of us,\nand every voyage brought us a memento of the countries he visited, and,\nwhat was better, tender caresses and kind words, on his return. Ah!\nyou will love him too, when you know him! Mary resembles him. He has a\nsweet voice like her. It is singular for a sailor, is it not?\"\n\n\"Yes, very singular, Robert,\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\"I see him still,\" replied the boy, as if speaking to himself. \"Good\nand brave papa! He rocked me to sleep on his knees, when I was little,\nand kept humming an old Scottish song which is sung around the lakes of\nour country. I sometimes recall the air, but indistinctly. How we loved\nhim, my lord! Well, I think one must be very young to love his father\nwell.\"\n\n\"And old to reverence him, my child,\" replied Glenarvan, quite moved by\nthe words that came from this young heart.\n\nDuring this conversation, their horses had relaxed their pace and\nfallen behind the other; but Thalcave called them, and they resumed\ntheir former gait. It was soon evident, however, that, with the\nexception of Thaouka, the horses could not long maintain this speed. At\nnoon it was necessary to give them an hour's rest.\n\nGlenarvan grew uneasy. The signs of dryness did not diminish, and the\nwant of water might result in disastrous consequences. Thalcave said\nnothing, but probably thought that if the Guamini was dry it would then\nbe time to despair, if indeed an Indian's heart has ever experienced\nsuch an emotion.\n\nThey therefore kept on, and by use of whip and spur the horses were\ninduced to continue their journey, but they could not quicken their\npace. Thalcave might easily have gone ahead, for in a few hours Thaouka\ncould have carried him to the banks of the stream. He doubtless thought\nof it, but probably did not like to leave his two companions alone in\nthe midst of this desert, and, that he might not outstrip them, he\nforced Thaouka to lessen his speed. It was not, however, without much\nresistance, prancing and neighing, that Thalcave's horse consented to\nkeep pace with the others. It was not so much the strength as the voice\nof his master which restrained him; the Indian actually talked to his\nhorse; and the animal, if he did not answer, at least comprehended\nhim. The Patagonian must have used excellent arguments, for, after\n\"discussing\" some time,"}, {"chunk_id": 78, "text": "tives\nwith a terrible roar.

No one ever knew; for the poor man was\nforced to swallow the end of his sentence in half a pint of muddy water.\n\nThe major calmly advanced, taking a regular stroke of which the most\nskillful swimmer would not have been ashamed. The sailors worked their\nway along like porpoises in their native element. As for Robert, he\nclung to Thaouka's mane, and was thus drawn along. The horse proudly\ncut the waters, and kept himself instinctively on a line with the tree,\ntowards which the current bore him, and which was now not far distant.\n\nIn a few moments the entire party reached it. It was fortunate; for, if\nthis refuge had failed, all chance of safety would have vanished, and\nthey must have perished in the waves. The water was up to the top of\nthe trunk where the main branches grew, so that it was easy to grasp\nthem.\n\nThalcave, leaving his horse, and lifting Robert, seized the first limb,\nand soon his powerful arms had lodged the exhausted swimmers in a place\nof safety. But Thaouka, carried away by the current, was rapidly\ndisappearing. He turned his intelligent head towards his master, and,\nshaking his long mane, neighed for him beseechingly.\n\n[Illustration: A huge wave, forty feet high, overwhelmed the fugitives\nwith a terrible roar.

A few moments after, his arm\nrested upon the neck of Thaouka, and horse and horseman swam away\ntogether towards the misty horizon of the north.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII.\n\nA SINGULAR ABODE.\n\n\nThe tree upon which Glenarvan and his companions had just found refuge\nresembled a walnut-tree. It had the same shining foliage and rounded\nform. It was the \"ombu,\" which is met with only on the Argentine\nPlains. It had an enormous, twisted trunk, and was confined to the\nearth not only by its great roots, but also by strong shoots which held\nit most tenaciously. It had thus resisted the force of the inundation.\n\n[Sidenote: AN ORNITHOLOGICAL OMNIUM-GATHERUM.]\n\nThis ombu measured one hundred feet in height, and might have covered\nwith its shade a circumference of three hundred and sixty feet. All\nthe upper part rested on three great branches, which forked from the\ntop of the trunk, that was six feet in diameter. Two of these branches\nwere nearly perpendicular, and supported the immense canopy of foliage,\nwhose crossed, twisted, and interlaced limbs, as if woven by the hand\nof a basket-maker, formed an impenetrable shelter. The third branch,\non the contrary, extended almost horizontally over the roaring waters;\nits leaves were bathed in them, while it seemed a promontory to this\nisland of verdure surrounded by an ocean. There was abundant space,\nalso, in the interior of this gigantic tree. The foliage, which was\nnot very dense at its outer circumference, left large openings like\nsky-lights, and made it well ventilated and cool. At sight of these\nbranches rising in innumerable ramifications towards the clouds, while\nthe parasitic convolvuli bound them to each other, and the rays of the\nsun shone through the interstices of the leaves, you would really have\nthought that the trunk of this ombu bore upon itself alone an entire\nforest.\n\nOn the arrival of the fugitives, a feathered population flew away to\nthe top branches, protesting by their cries against so flagran"}]}

Soon falls became frequent, and those who fell\ncould only advance by dragging themselves on their knees.\n\nExhaustion was about to put an end to this too prolonged ascent; and\nGlenarvan was considering with terror the extent of the snow, the cold\nwhich in this fatal region was so much to be dreaded, the shadows that\nwere deepening on the solitary peaks, and the absence of a shelter for\nthe night, when the major stopped him, and, in a calm tone, said,--\n\n\"A hut!\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\nA SUDDEN DESCENT.\n\n\nAny one but MacNabb would have passed by, around, or even over this\nhut a hundred times without suspecting its existence. A projection on\nthe surface of the snow scarcely distinguished it from the surrounding\nrocks. It was necessary to uncover it; after half an hour of persistent\nlabor, Wilson and Mulready had cleared away the entrance to the\n\"casucha,\" and the little party stepped in.\n\n[Sidenote: A \"RESTAURANT\" REOPENED.]\n\nThis casucha, constructed by the Indians, was made of adobes, a kind\nof bricks dried in the sun. Ten persons could easily find room inside,\nand, if its walls had not been sufficiently water-tight in the rainy\nseason, at this time, at least, they were some protection against the\nseverity of the cold. There was, besides, a sort of fireplace with a\nflue of bricks very poorly laid, which enabled them to kindle a fire,\nand thus withstand the external temperature.\n\n\"Here is a shelter, at least,\" said Glenarvan, \"even if it is not\ncomfortable. Providence has led us hither, and we cannot do better than\naccept t"}, {"chunk_id": 233, "text": "ctly,\" replied Harry Grant; \"and scarcely a day has passed but\nmemory has recalled those words upon which our only hope hung.\"\n\n\"And what are they, captain?\" inquired Glenarvan. \"Tell us, for our\ncuriosity is great.\"\n\n\"I am ready to satisfy you,\" continued Harry Grant; \"but you know that,\nto increase the chances of success, I inclosed in the bottle three\ndocuments, written in three languages. Which one do you wish to hear?\"\n\n\"They are not identical, then?\" cried Paganel.\n\n\"Yes, almost to a word.\"\n\n\"Well, give us the French document,\" said Glenarvan. \"This one was\nspared the most by the waves, and has served as the principal basis for\nour search.\"\n\n\"This is it, my lord, word for word,\" answered Harry Grant.\n\n\"'On the 27th June, 1862, the brig Britannia, of Glasgow, was lost\n1500 leagues from Patagonia, in the southern hemisphere. Carried by the\nwaves, two sailors and Captain Grant reached Tabor Island----'\"\n\n\"Ha!\" interrupted Paganel.\n\n\"'Here,'\" resumed Harry Grant, \"'continually a prey to a cruel\ndestitution, they cast this document into the sea at longitude 153° and\nlatitude 37° 11'. Come to their aid, or they are lost.'\"\n\nAt the word \"Tabor,\" Paganel had suddenly risen, and then, controlling\nhimself no longer, he cried:\n\n\"How Tabor Island? It is Maria Theresa.\"\n\n\"Certainly, Mr. Paganel,\" replied Harry Grant; \"Maria Theresa on the\nEnglish and German, but Tabor on the French maps.\"\n\nAt this moment a vigorous blow descended upon Paganel's shoulder. Truth\ncompels us to say that it was from the major, who now failed in his\nstrict habits of propriety.\n\n\"A fine geographer you are!\" said MacNabb, in a tone of badinage. \"But\nno matter, since we have succeeded.\"\n\n\"No matter?\" cried Paganel; \"I ought never to have forgotten that\ntwofold appellation! It is an unpardonable mistake, unworthy of the\nsecretary of a Geographical Society. I am disgraced!\"\n\nWhen the meal was finished, Harry Grant put everything in order in his\nhouse. He took nothing away, for he was willing that the guilty convict\nshould inherit his possessions.\n\nThey returned to the vessel; and, as he expected to sail the same day,\nGlenarvan gave orders for the quartermaster's landing. Ayrton was\nbrought on deck, and found himself in the presence of Harry Grant.\n\n\"It is I, Ayrton,\" said he.\n\n\"Yes, captain,\" replied Ayrton, without betraying any astonishment at\nHarry Grant's appearance. \"Well, I am not sorry to see you again in\ngood health.\"\n\n[Illustration: The passengers could see the quartermaster, with folded\narms, standing motionless as a statue, on a rock, and gazing at the\nvessel.]\n\n\"It seems, Ayrton, that I made a mistake in landing you on an inhabited\ncoast.\"\n\n\"It seems so, captain.\"\n\n\"You will take my place on this desert island. May Heaven lead you to\nrepentance!\"\n\n\"May it be so,\" rejoined Ayrton, in a calm tone.\n\nThen Glenarvan, addressing the quartermaster, said:\n\n\"Do you still adhere, Ayrton, to this determination to be abandoned?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord.\"\n\n\"Does Tabor Island suit you?\"\n\n\"Perfectly.\"\n\n\"Now listen to my last words. You will be far removed from every land,\nand deprived of all communication with your fellow-men. Miracles are\nrare, and you will not probably remove from this island, where we leave\nyou. You will be alone, under the eye of God, who reads the uttermost\ndepths of all hearts; but you will not be lost, as was Captain Grant.\nHowever unworthy you may be of the remembrance of men, still they will\nremember you. I know where you are, and will never forget you.\"\n\n\"Thank you, my lord!\" replied Ayrton, simply.\n\nSuch were the last words exchanged between Glenarvan and the\nquartermaster. The boat was ready, and Ayrton embarked. Captain Mangles\nhad previously sent to the island several cases of preserved food, some\nclothes, tools, weapons, and a supply of powder and shot. The abandoned\nman could therefore employ his time to advantage. Nothing was wanting,\nnot even books, foremost among which was a Bible.\n\nThe hour for separation had come.

Besides all this, here was the centre\nof the varied agencies by which the reports were brought in from the\ncompanies established for mining purposes, and also from each isolated\nworker, of the space purchased, the number of feet or yards dug, the\nore extracted, the comparative richness or poverty of the soil here,\nthere, and elsewhere, which in their summarized and aggregate form have\ngreatly helped to a correct knowledge of the comparative and absolute\ngold-bearing value of various spots. Then, in addition to the usual\noperations of a banking establishment, it was here that the ore was\nstored, from hence that it was sent, under government escort and with\ngovernment guarantee, subject to a fixed, though moderate, charge,\nso that the transport to Melbourne, which at first was a dangerous\nand expensive \"middle passage,\" was now as easily and inexpensively\naccomplished as is the transmission of freight from London to Paris.\n\n[Illustration: In the streets, in connection with the strange\nsign-boards and announcements, the novel erections and purposes to\nwhich some of them were adapted, Paganel had a history and commentary\nfor every one.]\n\nOver the whole of this establishment they were conducted by the most\ncourteous and obliging of officials, and the services thus rendered\ncharmed the Frenchman, who was none the less loquacious, and was in\ntruth able even to enlighten his guides.\n\n[Illustration: Here was the mineralogical museum, in which might be\nseen specimens illustrative of all the various ways in which the gold\nhas been found.]\n\n[Sidenote: PLEASING PROGRESS.]\n\nBut his joy culminated when, after some time spent in the hotel, the\nparty left the town, and passed through the \"diggings,\" properly so\ncalled. It was difficult to persuade Paganel and Robert--who kept\ntogether--to come on, in order that they might not leave Ayrton and\nMulready too long in suspense. Now the Frenchman would see just the key\nthat he needed to understand a point not before clear to him; anon you\nmight see him as in the illustration, when he had picked up a pebble\nand was sure that it was in itself so interesting as a mineralogical\nspecimen that he must treasure it up for the Bank of France, so that\nhis own land might have at least one part of Australia. All this was\ndone with such a mingling of childish good-nature and scientific and\nnational pride that it was useless to do anything but laugh, and an\nirrepressible smile came over even the major's features. At length,\nhowever, by drawing him into a lecture, they succeeded in persuading\nhim to follow them; and, as they left the diggings, he told them the\nhistory of the prophecies, the discovery, and the spread of knowledge\nas to the rich auriferous deposits of this part of Australia. He\ncould give them facts and incidents and dates as to the ingress into\nMelbourne, and the exodus therefrom to the diggings, in the year 1852;\nhe told them how the energy and the love of order which characterize\nthe English-speaking peoples had reduced to system, method,\nsubordination, the chaotic surgings and restlessness which marked the\nfirst weeks and months of this new era; and he detailed, as though\nhe had studied the subject to the entire neglect of other matters,\nthe working of the system,--how the land was registered, what was the\nsum paid in the aggregate, how the taxes were collected, wherein the\nsystem had been found faulty. All this occupied much time, and, before\nhe had finished, the cart was in sight, in which Lady Helena and Miss\nGrant reseated themselves, and for the remainder of the day and the\nsucceeding night their progress was in the accustomed order.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\n\nA WARNING.\n\n\nAt sunrise the travelers left the gold regions and crossed the\nfrontiers of the county of Talbot.

I am going to\nchoose an observatory above, and, with the aid of my telescope, will\nkeep you acquainted with what goes on here.\"\n\nThe geographer was allowed to go. He very adroitly swung himself\nfrom branch to branch, and disappeared behind the thick curtain of\nfoliage. His companions at once occupied themselves with making the\nsleeping-room and preparing their beds, which was neither a difficult\nnor a lengthy task. As there were no bedclothes to fix nor furniture to\narrange, each soon resumed his place by the fire.\n\nThey then conversed, but not about their present condition, which they\nmust patiently endure. They returned to the inexhaustible subject of\nCaptain Grant's recovery. If the waters subsided, in three days the\ntravelers would be again on board the Duncan. But the captain and his\ntwo sailors, those unfortunate castaways, would not be with them; and\nit even seemed after this failure, after this vain search in South\nAmerica, as if all hope of finding them were irrevocably lost. Whither\ndirect a new search? What, too, would be the grief of Lady Helena and\nMary Grant on learning that the future had no hope in store for them!\n\n\"Poor sister!\" exclaimed Robert; \"all is over for us!\"\n\n[Illustration: Glenarvan, Paganel, the major, Austin, and Mulready were\nseated astraddle, or dangling in the branches, according to their own\ninclinations.]\n\nGlenarvan, for the first time, had no consoling answer to make.\nWhat hope could he give the child? Had he not followed with rigorous\nexactitude the directions of the document?\n\n\"At all events,\" said he, \"this thirty-seventh degree of latitude is\nno vain indication. Have we not supposed, interpreted, and ascertained\nthat it relates to the shipwreck or the captivity of Captain Grant?\nHave we not read it with our own eyes?\"\n\n\"All that is true, my lord,\" replied Tom Austin; \"nevertheless our\nsearch has not succeeded.\"\n\n\"It is discouraging as well as annoying,\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\"Annoying if you will,\" replied MacNabb, in a calm tone, \"but not\ndiscouraging. Precisely because we thus have a definite item, we must\nthoroughly exhaust all its instructions.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" inquired Glenarvan. \"What do you think ought to be\ndone?\"\n\n\"A very simple and reasonable thing, my dear Edward. Let us turn our\nfaces towards the east, when we are on board the Duncan, and follow\nthe thirty-seventh parallel even around to our starting-point, if\nnecessary.\"\n\n\"Do you think, my dear major, that I have not thought of this?\" replied\nGlenarvan. \"Indeed I have, a hundred times. But what chance have we of\nsucceeding? Is not leaving the American continent departing from the\nplace indicated by Captain Grant himself, from Patagonia, so clearly\nnamed in the document?\"\n\n\"Do you wish to begin your search in the Pampas again,\" replied the\nmajor, \"when you are sure that the shipwreck of the Britannia did not\ntake place on the Pacific or Atlantic coast?\"\n\nGlenarvan did not answer.\n\n\"And however feeble the chance of finding Captain Grant by following\nthis latitude may be, still ought we not to attempt it?\"\n\n\"I do not deny it,\" replied Glenarvan.\n\n[Sidenote: APPLIED GEOGRAPHY.]\n\n\"And you, my friends,\" added the major, addressing the sailors, \"are\nyou not of my opinion?\"\n\n\"Entirely,\" answer"}]}

The night was dark. I saw no one on\nboard.

Everything was\nexplained. But what would the geographer say, when he learned the name\nand destination of the vessel on which he had taken passage?\n\n\"So, Monsieur Paganel,\" said Glenarvan, \"you have chosen Calcutta as\nyour centre of action?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord.

A gold medal is promised to that\ntraveler who shall succeed in supplying this much-needed information on\nIndian geography.\"\n\nPaganel was grandiloquent. He spoke with a lofty animation, and was\ncarried away in the rapid flight of imagination. It would have been\nas impossible to check him as to stay the Rhine at the Falls of\nSchaffhausen.\n\n\"Monsieur Jacques Paganel,\" said Lord Glenarvan, after a moment\nof silence, \"that is certainly a fine voyage, and one for which\nscience would be very grateful; but I will not further prolong your\nignorance. For the present, you must give up the pleasure of seeing\nIndia.\"\n\n\n\"Give it up! And why?\"\n\n\"Because you are turning your back upon the Indian peninsula.\"\n\n\"How? Captain Burton----\"\n\n\"I am not Captain Burton,\" replied John Mangles.\n\n\"But the Scotia?\"\n\n\"This vessel is not the Scotia.\"\n\nPaganel's amazement cannot be depicted. He looked first at Lord\nGlenarvan, always serious; then at Lady Helena and Miss Grant, whose\nfeatures expressed a sympathetic disappointment; and finally at Captain\nMangles, who was smiling, and the imperturbable major. Then, raising\nhis shoulders and drawing down his glasses from his forehead to his\neyes, he exclaimed,--\n\n\"What a joke!\"\n\nBut at that his eyes fell upon the steering wheel, on which were\ninscribed these two words, thus:\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"The Duncan! the Duncan!\" he cried in a tone of real despair; and,\nleaping down the companion-way, he rushed to his cabin.\n\nWhen the unfortunate geographer had disappeared, no one on board,\nexcept the major, could retain gravity, and the laugh was communicated\neven to the sailors. To mistake the railroad was not so bad; to take\nthe train to Dumbarton, instead of Edinburgh, would do. But to mistake\nthe vessel, and be sailing to Chili, when he wished to go to India, was\nthe height of absent-mindedness.\n\n[Sidenote: ABSENT-MINDEDNESS.]\n\n\"On the whole, I am not astonished at this on the part of Jacques\nPaganel,\" said Glenarvan; \"he is noted for such blunders. He once\npublished a celebrated "}, {"chunk_id": 196, "text": "scene of cannibalism, which followed in all\nits horrible details.]\n\n[Illustration: The corpses, folded together, in a sitting posture,\nand tied in their clothes by a girdle of withes, were placed on this\nprimitive bier.]\n\nBut Kai-Koumou had preserved his reason in the midst of the general\nintoxication. He allowed this bloody orgy an hour to reach its utmost\nintensity. The last act of the funeral was played with the usual rites.\n\nThe bodies of Kara-Tété and his wife were taken up, and their limbs\nbent and gathered against the stomach, according to the New Zealand\ncustom. The place for the tomb had been chosen outside of the\nfortification, about two miles distant, on the summit of a small\nmountain, called Maunganamu, situated on the right shore of the lake.\n\nThither the bodies were to be carried. Two very rude palanquins, or\nrather litters, were brought to the foot of the mound. The corpses,\nfolded together, in a sitting posture, and tied in their clothes by a\ngirdle of withes, were placed on this primitive bier. Four warriors\nbore it between them, and the entire tribe, chanting the funeral hymn,\nfollowed them in procession to the place of burial.\n\nThe captives, who were always watched, saw them leave the inner\ninclosure of the pah, and then the songs and cries gradually died away.\nFor about half an hour this funeral escort continued in sight, in the\ndepths of the valley. Finally they perceived it again winding along\nthe mountain paths. The distance gave a fantastic appearance to the\nundulating movements of the long, sinuous column.\n\nThe tribe stopped at the summit of the mountain, which was eight\nhundred feet high, at the place prepared for Kara-Tété's interment.\nA common Maori would have had only a hole and a heap of stones for a\ngrave; but for a powerful and dreaded chief, destined doubtless for a\nspeedy deification, a tomb worthy of his exploits was reserved.\n\n[Sidenote: THE LAST NIGHT.]\n\nThe sepulchre had been surrounded by palisades, while stakes,\nornamented with faces reddened with ochre, stood beside the grave\nwhere the bodies were to lie. The relatives had not forgotten that the\n\"waidoua\" (the spirit of the dead) feeds on substantial nourishment\nlike the body during this perishable life. Food had therefore been\ndeposited in the inclosure, together with the weapons and clothes of\nthe deceased.\n\nNothing was wanting for the comfort of the tomb. Husband and wife were\nlaid side by side, and then covered with earth and grass after a series\nof renewed lamentations. Then the procession silently descended the\nmountain, and now no one could ascend it under penalty of death, for it\nwas tabooed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LI.\n\nSTRANGELY LIBERATED.\n\n\nJust as the sun was disappearing behind Lake Taupo, the captives were\nled back to their prison. They were not to leave it again until the\nsummit of the Wahiti mountains should kindle with the first beams of\nthe day. One night remained to prepare for death. In spite of the\nfaintness, in spite of the horror with which they were seized, they\nshared their repast in common.\n\n\"We shall need all the strength possible to face death,\" said\nGlenarvan. \"We must show these barbarians how Europeans and Christians\ncan die.\"\n\nThe meal being finished, Lady Helena repeated the evening prayer aloud,\nwhile all her companions, with uncovered heads, joined her. Having\nfulfilled this duty, and enjoyed this privilege, the prisoners embraced\neach other. Lady Helena and Mary Grant then retired to one corner of\nthe hut, and stretched themselves upon a mat. Sleep, which soothes all\nwoes, soon closed their eyes, and they slumbered in each other's arms,\novercome by fatigue and long wakefulness.\n\nGlenarvan, taking his friends aside, said:\n\n\"My dear companions, our lives and those of these poor ladies are in\nGod's hands.

Captain Mangles and the major\nrushed towards it. In a few moments they perceived, on the edge of\nthe coppice, a human form that was dragging itself along and groaning\npiteously. It was Mulready, wounded and half dead. When his companions\nraised him, they felt their hands dabbling in blood. The rain now\nincreased, and the wind howled through the branches of the dead trees.\nIn the midst of these terrific gusts, Glenarvan, the major, and the\ncaptain bore the body of Mulready.\n\nOn arriving at the cart, Paganel, Robert, Wilson, and Olbinett came\nout, and Lady Helena gave up her room to the poor sailor. The major\ntook off Mulready's vest, wet with blood and rain. He discovered the\nwound. It was a poniard stab, which the unfortunate had received in his\nright side.\n\nMacNabb dressed it skillfully. Whether the weapon had reached the vital\nparts, he could not say. A stream of bright-red blood spurted forth,\nwhile the paleness and the swoon of the wounded man proved that he had\nbeen seriously injured. The major accordingly placed upon the opening\nof the wound, after first washing it with fresh water, a thick wad of\ntinder, and then a few layers of lint, confined by a bandage, and thus\nsucceeded in stopping the hemorrhage. The patient was then laid on his\nside, his head and breast raised, and Lady Helena gave him a refreshing\ndraught.\n\nAt the end of a quarter of an hour, the wounded man, who had been\nmotionless till then, made a movement. His eyes half opened, his lips\nmurmured disconnected words, and the major, putting down his ear, heard\nhim say:\n\n\"My lord--the letter--Ben Joyce----\"\n\n[Sidenote: A DAY OF DOUBT.]\n\nThe major repeated these words, and glanced at his companions. What did\nMulready mean? Ben Joyce had attacked the sailor, but why? Was it not\nsimply for the purpose of preventing him from reaching the Duncan? This\nletter--Glenarvan examined the sailor's pockets. The letter addressed\nto Tom Austin was gone.\n\nThe night passed in anxiety and anguish. They feared every moment that\nthe wounded man would die. A burning fever consumed him. Lady Helena\nand Mary Grant, as though his sisters, did not leave him; never was\npatient better nursed, or by more tender hands.\n\nDay appeared. The rain had ceased. Heavy clouds still rolled along\nthe vault of the sky, and the earth was strewn with the fragments of\nbranches. The clay, soaked by floods of water, had yielded; and the\nsides of the cart became unsteady, but sank no deeper.\n\nCaptain Mangles, Paganel, and Glenarvan took a tour of exploration\naround the camp. They traversed the path still marked with blood, but\nfound no trace of Ben Joyce or his band. They went to the place where\nthe attack had been made. Here two corpses lay on the ground, shot\nby Mulready. One was the farrier of Black Point. His face, which had\nmortified, was a horrible sight.\n\nGlenarvan did not pursue his investigations farther, prudence\nforbidding. He therefore returned to the cart, much alarmed by the\nseriousness of the situation.\n\n\"We cannot think of sending another messenger to Melbourne,\" said he.\n\n\"But we must,\" replied Captain Mangles; \"and I will make the attempt,\nsince my sailor has failed.\"\n\n\"No, John. You have not even a horse to carry you these two hundred\nmiles.\"\n\nIndeed, Mulready's horse, the only one that remained, had not\nreappeared. Had he fallen beneath the shots of the murderers? Was he\nrunning wild over the desert? Had the convicts captured him?\n\n[Illustration: In the midst of these terrific gusts, Glenarvan, the\nmajor, and the captain bore the body of Mulready.]\n\n[Sidenote: RESOLUTION, AND RECOVERY.]\n\n\"Whatever happens,\" continued Glenarvan, \"we will separate no more.\nLet us wait eight or fifteen days, till the waters of the river resume\ntheir natural level.

The silence of sleeping nature was broken only\nby the sound of the horses' chains as they rattled against their feet.\nPaganel was becoming fully absorbed in his astronomical meditations,\nand occupying himself more with the things of heaven than those of\nearth, when a distant sound startled him from his reverie.\n\nHe listened attentively, and, to his great astonishment, thought he\ndistinguished the tones of a piano. A few boldly-struck chords wafted\nto his ears their harmonious vibrations. He could not be mistaken.\n\n\"A piano in the desert!\" said he to himself. \"It cannot be!\"\n\nIt was indeed very surprising, and Paganel began to think that some\nstrange Australian bird was imitating the sound of the instrument.\n\n[Sidenote: A TWOFOLD SURPRISE.]\n\nBut at that moment a voice, harmoniously pitched, was heard. The\npianist was accompanied by a vocalist. The geographer listened\nincredulously, but in a few moments was forced to recognize the\nsublime air that struck upon his ear. It was \"_Il mio tesoro tanto_\"\nfrom Don Juan.\n\n[Illustration: Paganel did not lie down, but, rifle on shoulder,\nguarded the encampment, walking to and fro that he might the better\nresist sleep.]\n\n\"Parbleu!\" thought the geographer, \"however strange the Australian\nbirds may be, or even though the parrots were the most musical in the\nworld, they could not sing Mozart.\"\n\nHe listened to the end of this grand inspiration of the master. The\neffect of this sweet melody, in the stillness of the starlit night,\nwas indescribable. He remained a long time under the influences of its\nenchantment. At last the voice ceased, and all was silent.\n\nWhen Wilson came to relieve the geographer, he found him wrapt in a\nprofound reverie. Paganel said nothing to the sailor, but, reserving\nhis account of the incident for Glenarvan the next day, he crept into\nthe tent.\n\nIn the morning the whole party were awakened by unexpected bayings.\nGlenarvan at once arose. Two magnificent pointers were gamboling along\nthe edge of a small wood; but at the approach of the travelers they\ndisappeared among the trees, barking loudly.\n\n\"There must be a station in this desert,\" said Glenarvan, \"and hunters,\nsince those are hunting-dogs.\"\n\nPaganel was just about to relate his experiences of the past night,\nwhen two men appeared, in hunting costume, mounted on fine horses.

The young men bowed, and one of them,\nthe elder, said:\n\n\"My lord, will your ladies, your companions, and yourself do us the\nhonor to accompany us to our house?\"\n\n\"May I ask, gentlemen, whom I have the honor of addressing?\" inquired\nGlenarvan.\n\n\"Michael and Alexander Patterson, proprietors of Hottam Station.

Welcome, welcome! I am almost a\nFrenchman,\" cried the commander, shaking the geographer's arm with\nrather painful violence.]\n\n[Sidenote: RAISING A REGIMENT.]\n\nHe then entered into conversation with the commander. Glenarvan would\ngladly have put in a word in regard to his affairs, but the soldier\nwas telling his story, and was not in the mood to be interrupted.\nThis honest man had left France a long time before; and the native\nlanguage was no longer perfectly familiar to him: he had forgotten,\nif not words, at least the manner of combining them. As his visitors\nsoon learned, he had been a sergeant in the French army. Since the\nfoundation of the fort he had not left it, and commanded it by\nappointment from the Argentine government. He was by parentage a\nBasque, and his name was Manuel Ipharaguerre. A year after his arrival\nin the country, Sergeant Manuel was naturalized, joined the Argentine\narmy, and married an honest Indian woman, who had twins,--boys, to be\nsure, for the sergeant's worthy consort would never present him with\ndaughters. Manuel did not think of any other calling than that of the\nsoldier, and hoped, in time, with the help of God, to offer to the\nrepublic a whole battalion of young soldiers.\n\n\"You have seen them?\" said he. \"Charming fellows! Good soldiers! José!\nJuan! Miguel! Pepe! Pepe is only seven years old, and is already biting\nhis cartridge!\"\n\nPepe, hearing himself complimented, joined his two little feet, and\npresented arms with perfect precision.\n\n\"He will do!\" added the sergeant. \"He will be a major--or\nbrigadier-general one day!\"\n\nThis story lasted a quarter of an hour, to Thalcave's great\nastonishment. The Indian could not understand how so many words could\ncome from a single throat. No one interrupted the commander; and even\na French sergeant had to conclude at last, though not without forcing\nhis guests to accompany him to his dwelling. Here they were introduced\nto Madame Ipharaguerre, who appeared to be \"a good-looking person,\" if\nthis expression may be employed in regard to an Indian.\n\nWhen he had exhausted himself, the sergeant asked his guests to what he\nowed the honor of their visit. And now it was their turn to explain.\n\nPaganel, opening the conversation in French, told him of their journey\nacross the Pampas, and ended by asking why the Indians had abandoned\nthe country.\n\n\"War!\" replied the sergeant.\n\n\"War?\"\n\n\"Yes, civil war.\"\n\n\"Civil war?\" rejoined Paganel.\n\n\"Yes, war between Paraguay and Buenos Ayres,\" answered the sergeant.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Why, all the Indians of the north are in the rear of General Flores,\nand those of the plains are plundering.\"\n\n\"But the caziques?\"\n\n\"The caziques with them.\"\n\nThis answer was reported to Thalcave, who shook his head. Indeed,\nhe either did not know, or had forgotten, that a civil war, which\nwas afterwards to involve Brazil, was decimating two-thirds of the\nrepublic. The Indians had everything to gain in these internal\nstruggles, and could not neglect such fine opportunities for plunder.\nThe sergeant, therefore, was not mistaken in attributing this desertion\nof the Pampas to the civil war that was being waged in the northern\npart of the Argentine Provinces.\n\nBut this event disconcerted Glenarvan's hopes. If Captain Grant was\na prisoner of the caziques, he must have been carried by them to the\nnorthern frontiers. Yet how and where to find him? Must they attempt\na perilous and almost useless search to the northern limits of the\nPampas? It was a serious matter, which was to be earnestly considered.\n\nHowever, one important question was still to be asked of the sergeant,\nand the major thought of this, while his companions were looking at\neach other in silence.\n\n\"Hav"}]}

People seemed as though they could not show him enough\nattention.\n\nJust at this time an amiable lady of thirty, none other than the\nmajor's cousin, a little eccentric herself, but still agreeable and\ncharming, fell in love with the geographer's peculiarities. Paganel was\nfar from being insensible to Miss Arabella's attractions, yet did not\ndare to declare his sentiments. The major accordingly undertook the\npart of Cupid's messenger between these two congenial hearts, and even\ntold Paganel that marriage was \"the last blunder\" that he could commit.\nBut the geographer was very much embarrassed, and, strangely enough,\ncould not summon courage to speak for himself.\n\n[Illustration: Early in the afternoon the travelers reached Malcolm\nCastle, amidst the hurrahs of their tenantry and friends.]\n\n\"Does not Miss Arabella please you?\" MacNabb would say to him.\n\n\"Oh, major, she is charming!\" cried Paganel,--\"a thousand times too\ncharming for me; and, if I must tell you, would please me better if she\nwere less so. I should like to find a defect.\"\n\n\"Be easy,\" answered the major; \"she has more than one. The most perfect\nwoman always has her share. Well, then, Paganel, are you decided?\"\n\n\"I do not dare.\"\n\n\"But, my learned friend, why do you hesitate?\"\n\n\"I am unworthy of her!\" was the geographer's invariable reply.\n\nAt last, one day, driven desperate by the irrepressible major, Paganel\nconfessed to him, under the pledge of secrecy, a peculiarity that would\nfacilitate his identification, if the police should ever be on his\ntrack!\n\n\"Bah!\" exclaimed the major.\n\n\"It is as I tell you,\" persisted Paganel.\n\n\"What matter, my worthy friend?\"\n\n\"Is that your opinion?\"\n\n\"On the contrary, you are only more remarkable. This adds to your\npersonal advantages. It makes you the inimitable individual of whom\nArabella has dreamed.\"\n\nAnd the major, preserving an imperturbable gravity, left Paganel a prey\nto the most acute anxiety.\n\nA short interview took place between MacNabb and the lady, and fifteen\nweeks after a marriage was celebrated with great pomp in the chapel of\nMalcolm Castle.\n\n[Illustration: Fifteen weeks after a marriage was celebrated with great\npomp in the chapel of Malcolm Castle.]\n\nThe geographer's secret would doubtless have remained forever\nburied in the abysses of the unknown if the major had not told it to\nGlenarvan, who did not conceal it from Lady Helena, who communicated\nit to Mrs. Mangles.

It was possible that the three\nprisoners had been separated a long time. But the substance of the\nPatagonian's information was that the Indians spoke of a European who\nhad fallen into their power. The date of his captivity, the place where\nhe must have been, everything, even to the Patagonian phrase used to\nexpress his courage, related evidently to Captain Harry Grant.\n\nTheir progress was now somewhat slow and difficult; their next object\nbeing to reach and cross the river Colorado, to which at length\ntheir horses brought them. Here Paganel's first care was to bathe\n\"geographically\" in its waters, which are colored by a reddish clay. He\nwas surprised to find the depth so great as it really was, this being\nthe result of the snow having melted rapidly under the first heat of\nsummer. The width likewise of this stream was so considerable that it\nwas almost impossible for their horses to swim across; but they happily\ndiscovered a sort of weir-bridge, of wattles looped and fastened\ntogether, which the Indians were in the habit of using; and by its aid\nthe little troop was enabled to pass over to the left bank, where they\nrested for the night.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\nA SERIOUS NECESSITY.\n\n\nThey set out at daybreak. The horses advanced at a brisk pace among\nthe tufts of \"paja-brava,\" a kind of grass that serves the Indians\nas a shelter during the storms. At certain distances, but less and\nless frequent, pools of shallow water contributed to the growth of\nwillows and a certain plant which is found in the neighborhood of\nfresh water. Here the horses drank their fill, to fortify themselves\nfor the journey. Thalcave, who rode in advance, beat the bushes, and\nthus frightened away the \"cholinas\" (vipers), while the agile Thaouka\nbounded over all obstacles, and aided his master in clearing a passage\nfor the horses that followed.\n\n[Illustration: They set out at daybreak. The horses advanced at a brisk\npace among the tufts of \"paja-brava,\" a kind of grass that serves the\nIndians as a shelter during the storms.]\n\nEarly in the afternoon, the first traces of animals were\nencountered--the bones of an innumerable drove of cattle, in whitened\nheaps. These fragments did not extend in a winding line, such as\nanimals exhausted and falling one by one would leave behind them. Thus\nno one, not even Paganel, knew how to explain this chain of skeletons\nin a space comparatively circumscribed. He therefore questioned\nThalcave, who was not at a loss for a reply.\n\n\"What is this?\" they asked, after Paganel had inquired of the Indian.\n\n\"The fire of heaven,\" replied the geographer.\n\n\"What! the lightning could not have produced such a disaster,\" said Tom\nAustin, \"and stretched five hundred head of cattle on the earth!\"\n\nBut Thalcave reaffirmed it, and he was not mistaken; for the storms of\nthe Pampas are noted for their violence.\n\nAt evening they stopped at an abandoned rancho, made of interlaced\nbranches plastered with mud and covered with thatch. This structure\nstood within an inclosure of half-rotten stakes which, however,\nsufficed to protect the horses during the night against the attacks of\nthe foxes. Not that they had anything to fear personally from these\nanimals, but the malicious beasts gnawed the halters, so that the\nhorses could escape.\n\nA few paces from the rancho, a hole was dug which served as a kitchen\nand contained half-cooled embers. Within, there was a bench, a bed of\nox-hide, a saucepan, a spit, and a pot for boiling maté. The maté is\na drink very much in use in South America. It is the Indian's tea,\nconsisting of a decoction of leaves dried in the fire, and is imbibed\nthrough a straw. At Paganel's request, Thalcave prepared several\ncups of this beverage, which very agreeably accompanied the ordinary\neatables, and was declared excellent.\n\n[Sidenote: A CHANGE FOR THE WORSE.]\n\nThe next day they resumed their journey towards the east. About noon\na change took place in the appearance of the Pampas, which could\nnot escape eyes weari"}, {"chunk_id": 129, "text": "onda\nfor its wealth and attractions. Besides all this, here was the centre\nof the varied agencies by which the reports were brought in from the\ncompanies established for mining purposes, and also from each isolated\nworker, of the space purchased, the number of feet or yards dug, the\nore extracted, the comparative richness or poverty of the soil here,\nthere, and elsewhere, which in their summarized and aggregate form have\ngreatly helped to a correct knowledge of the comparative and absolute\ngold-bearing value of various spots. Then, in addition to the usual\noperations of a banking establishment, it was here that the ore was\nstored, from hence that it was sent, under government escort and with\ngovernment guarantee, subject to a fixed, though moderate, charge,\nso that the transport to Melbourne, which at first was a dangerous\nand expensive \"middle passage,\" was now as easily and inexpensively\naccomplished as is the transmission of freight from London to Paris.\n\n[Illustration: In the streets, in connection with the strange\nsign-boards and announcements, the novel erections and purposes to\nwhich some of them were adapted, Paganel had a history and commentary\nfor every one.]\n\nOver the whole of this establishment they were conducted by the most\ncourteous and obliging of officials, and the services thus rendered\ncharmed the Frenchman, who was none the less loquacious, and was in\ntruth able even to enlighten his guides.\n\n[Illustration: Here was the mineralogical museum, in which might be\nseen specimens illustrative of all the various ways in which the gold\nhas been found.]\n\n[Sidenote: PLEASING PROGRESS.]\n\nBut his joy culminated when, after some time spent in the hotel, the\nparty left the town, and passed through the \"diggings,\" properly so\ncalled. It was difficult to persuade Paganel and Robert--who kept\ntogether--to come on, in order that they might not leave Ayrton and\nMulready too long in suspense. Now the Frenchman would see just the key\nthat he needed to understand a point not before clear to him; anon you\nmight see him as in the illustration, when he had picked up a pebble\nand was sure that it was in itself so interesting as a mineralogical\nspecimen that he must treasure it up for the Bank of France, so that\nhis own land might have at least one part of Australia. All this was\ndone with such a mingling of childish good-nature and scientific and\nnational pride that it was useless to do anything but laugh, and an\nirrepressible smile came over even the major's features. At length,\nhowever, by drawing him into a lecture, they succeeded in persuading\nhim to follow them; and, as they left the diggings, he told them the\nhistory of the prophecies, the discovery, and the spread of knowledge\nas to the rich auriferous deposits of this part of Australia. He\ncould give them facts and incidents and dates as to the ingress into\nMelbourne, and the exodus therefrom to the diggings, in the year 1852;\nhe told them how the energy and the love of order which characterize\nthe English-speaking peoples had reduced to system, method,\nsubordination, the chaotic surgings and restlessness which marked the\nfirst weeks and months of this new era; and he detailed, as though\nhe had studied the subject to the entire neglect of other matters,\nthe working of the system,--how the land was registered, what was the\nsum paid in the aggregate, how the taxes were collected, wherein the\nsystem had been found faulty. All this occupied much time, and, before\nhe had finished, the cart was in sight, in which Lady Helena and Miss\nGrant reseated themselves, and for the remainder of the day and the\nsucceeding night their progress was in the accustomed order.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\n\nA WARNING.\n\n\nAt sunrise the travelers left the gold regions and crossed the\nfrontiers of the county of Talbot.

The night was dark. I saw no one on\nboard. Feeling fatigued by thirty hours of travel, and knowing that\na good way to avoid sea-sickness is to go to bed on embarking, and\nnot stir from your bunk for the first days of the voyage, I retired\nimmediately, and have conscientiously slept thirty-six hours, I assure\nyou.\"\n\nJacques Paganel's hearers now knew the reason of his presence on board.\nThe Frenchman, mistaking the vessel, had embarked while the crew of\nthe Duncan were engaged in the ceremony at Saint Mungo. Everything was\nexplained. But what would the geographer say, when he learned the name\nand destination of the vessel on which he had taken passage?\n\n\"So, Monsieur Paganel,\" said Glenarvan, \"you have chosen Calcutta as\nyour centre of action?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord.

A gold medal is promised to that\ntraveler who shall succeed in supplying this much-needed information on\nIndian geography.\"\n\nPaganel was grandiloquent. He spoke with a lofty animation, and was\ncarried away in the rapid flight of imagination. It would have been\nas impossible to check him as to stay the Rhine at the Falls of\nSchaffhausen.\n\n\"Monsieur Jacques Paganel,\" said Lord Glenarvan, after a moment\nof silence, \"that is certainly a fine voyage, and one for which\nscience would be very grateful; but I will not further prolong your\nignorance. For the present, you must give up the pleasure of seeing\nIndia.\"\n\n\n\"Give it up! And why?\"\n\n\"Because you are turning your back upon the Indian peninsula.\"\n\n\"How? Captain Burton----\"\n\n\"I am not Captain Burton,\" replied John Mangles.\n\n\"But the Scotia?\"\n\n\"This vessel is not the Scotia.\"\n\nPaganel's amazement cannot be depicted. He looked first at Lord\nGlenarvan, always serious; then at Lady Helena and Miss Grant, whose\nfeatures expressed a sympathetic disappointment; and finally at Captain\nMangles, who was smiling, and the imperturbable major. Then, raising\nhis shoulders and drawing down his glasses from his forehead to his\neyes, he exclaimed,--\n\n\"What a joke!\"\n\nBut at that his eyes fell upon the steering wheel, on which were\ninscribed these two words, thus:\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"The Duncan! the Duncan!\" he cried in a tone of real despair; and,\nleaping down the companion-way, he rushed to his cabin.\n\nWhen the unfortunate geographer had disappeared, no one on board,\nexcept the major, could retain gravity, and the laugh was communicated\neven to the sailors. To mistake the railroad was not so bad; to take\nthe train to Dumbarton, instead of Edinburgh, would do. But to mistake\nthe vessel, and be sailing to Chili, when he wished to go to India, was\nthe height of absent-mindedness.\n\n[Sidenote: ABSENT-MINDEDNESS.]\n\n\"On the whole, I am not astonished at this on the part of Jacques\nPaganel,\" said Glenarvan; \"he is noted for such blunders. He once\npublished a celebrated "}, {"chunk_id": 86, "text": "ers,\nfamilies, genera, sub-genera, species----\"\n\n\"Very fine!\" said MacNabb. \"I should not have thought of that!

Paganel could not hope to encounter any in\nthis aerial forest.\"\n\n\"No,\" replied the geographer, \"although we beat the bush. It is a pity,\nfor it would have been a glorious hunt. A ferocious man-eater like the\njaguar! With one blow of his paw he can twist the neck of a horse. When\nhe has tasted human flesh, however, he returns to it ravenously. What\nhe likes best is the Indian, then the negro, then the mulatto, and then\nthe white man.\"\n\n\"However that may be, my good Paganel,\" said Glenarvan, \"so long as\nthere are no Indians, mulattoes, or negroes among us, I rejoice in\nthe absence of your dear jaguars.

We lead the life of\nbirds; we sing and flutter about. I almost think that men were destined\nto live in the trees.\"\n\n\"They only want wings,\" said the major.\n\n\"They will make them some day.\"\n\n\"In the meantime,\" replied Glenarvan, \"permit me, my dear friend, to\nprefer the sand of a park, the floor of a house, or the deck of a\nvessel to this aerial abode.\"\n\n\"Glenarvan,\" said Paganel, \"we must take things as they come. If\nfavorable, so much the better; if unfavorable, we must not mind it. I\nsee you long for the comforts of Malcolm Castle.\"\n\n\"No, but----\"\n\n\"I am certain that Robert is perfectly happy,\" interrupted Paganel, to\nsecure one advocate, at least, of his theories.\n\n\"Yes, Monsieur Paganel!\" cried the boy, in a joyful tone.\n\n\"It is natural at his age,\" replied Glenarvan.\n\n\"And at mine,\" added the geographer. \"The less ease we have, the fewer\nwants; the fewer wants, the happier we are.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the major, \"here is Paganel going to make an attack upon\nriches and gilded splendor.\"\n\n\"No, my dear major,\" continued Paganel; \"but, if you wish, I will tell\nyou, in this connection, a little Arab story that occurs to me.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, Monsieur Paganel,\" cried Robert.\n\n\"And what will your story prove?\" asked the major.\n\n\"What all stories prove, my brave companion.\"\n\n\"Not much, then,\" replied MacNabb. \"But go on, Scheherezade, and tell\none of those stories that you relate so well.\"\n\n\"There was once upon a time,\" said Paganel, \"a son of the great\nHaroun-al-Raschid who was not happy.

For his father’s death he was\nin some manner prepared; but he knew not how to account for the\nmysterious disappearance of Mercédès.\n\nWithout divulging his secret, Dantès could not give sufficiently clear\ninstructions to an agent. There were, besides, other particulars he was\ndesirous of ascertaining, and those were of a nature he alone could\ninvestigate in a manner satisfactory to himself. His looking-glass had\nassured him, during his stay at Leghorn, that he ran no risk of\nrecognition; moreover, he had now the means of adopting any disguise he\nthought proper. One fine morning, then, his yacht, followed by the\nlittle fishing-boat, boldly entered the port of Marseilles, and\nanchored exactly opposite the spot from whence, on the\nnever-to-be-forgotten night of his departure for the Château d’If, he\nhad been put on board the boat destined to convey him thither.\n\n0315m\n\n\n\nStill Dantès could not view without a shudder the approach of a\ngendarme who accompanied the officers deputed to demand his bill of\nhealth ere the yacht was permitted to hold communication with the\nshore; but with that perfect self-possession he had acquired during his\nacquaintance with Faria, Dantès coolly presented an English passport he\nhad obtained from Leghorn, and as this gave him a standing which a\nFrench passport would not have afforded, he was informed that there\nexisted no obstacle to his immediate debarkation.\n\nThe first person to attract the attention of Dantès, as he landed on\nthe Canebière, was one of the crew belonging to the _Pharaon_. Edmond\nwelcomed the meeting with this fellow—who had been one of his own\nsailors—as a sure means of testing the extent of the change which time\nhad worked in his own appearance. Going straight towards him, he\npropounded a variety of questions on different subjects, carefully\nwatching the man’s countenance as he did so; but not a word or look\nimplied that he had the slightest idea of ever having seen before the\nperson with whom he was then conversing.\n\nGiving the sailor a piece of money in return for his civility, Dantès\nproceeded onwards; but ere he had gone many steps he heard the man\nloudly calling him to stop.\n\nDantès instantly turned to meet him.\n\n“I beg your pardon, sir,” said the honest fellow, in almost breathless\nhaste, “but I believe you made a mistake; you intended to give me a\ntwo-franc piece, and see, you gave me a double Napoleon.”\n\n“Thank you, my good friend. I see that I have made a trifling mistake,\nas you say; but by way of rewarding your honesty I give you another\ndouble Napoleon, that you may drink to my health, and be able to ask\nyour messmates to join you.”\n\nSo extreme was the surprise of the sailor, that he was unable even to\nthank Edmond, whose receding figure he continued to gaze after in\nspeechless astonishment. “Some nabob from India,” was his comment.\n\nDantès, meanwhile, went on his way. Each step he trod oppressed his\nheart with fresh emotion; his first and most indelible recollections\nwere there; not a tree, not a street, that he passed but seemed filled\nwith dear and cherished memories. And thus he proceeded onwards till he\narrived at the end of the Rue de Noailles, from whence a full view of\nthe Allées de Meilhan was obtained. At this spot, so pregnant with fond\nand filial remembrances, his heart beat almost to bursting, his knees\ntottered under him, a mist floated over his sight, and had he not clung\nfor support to one of the trees, he would inevitably have fallen to the\nground and been crushed beneath the many vehicles continually passing\nthere. Recovering himself, however, he wiped the perspiration from his\nbrows, and stopped not again till he found himself at the door of the\nhouse in which his father had lived.\n\nThe nasturtiums and other plants, which his father had delighted to\ntrain before his window, had all disappeared from the upper part of the\nhouse.\n\nLeaning against the tree, he gazed thoughtfully for a time at the upper\nstories of the shabby little house.

So life went on for\nthem as it does for those who are not victims of misfortune and whose\nactivities glide along mechanically and tranquilly beneath the eye of\nProvidence.\n\nBut beneath this superficial calm there were in the heart of the young\nman, and perhaps in that of the old man, many repressed desires, many\nstifled sighs, which found vent when Faria was left alone, and when\nEdmond returned to his cell.\n\nOne night Edmond awoke suddenly, believing that he heard someone\ncalling him. He opened his eyes upon utter darkness. His name, or\nrather a plaintive voice which essayed to pronounce his name, reached\nhim. He sat up in bed and a cold sweat broke out upon his brow.\nUndoubtedly the call came from Faria’s dungeon.\n\n“Alas,” murmured Edmond; “can it be?”\n\nHe moved his bed, drew up the stone, rushed into the passage, and\nreached the opposite extremity; the secret entrance was open. By the\nlight of the wretched and wavering lamp, of which we have spoken,\nDantès saw the old man, pale, but yet erect, clinging to the bedstead.\nHis features were writhing with those horrible symptoms which he\nalready knew, and which had so seriously alarmed him when he saw them\nfor the first time.\n\n“Alas, my dear friend,” said Faria in a resigned tone, “you understand,\ndo you not, and I need not attempt to explain to you?”\n\nEdmond uttered a cry of agony, and, quite out of his senses, rushed\ntowards the door, exclaiming, “Help, help!”\n\nFaria had just sufficient strength to restrain him.\n\n“Silence,” he said, “or you are lost. We must now only think of you, my\ndear friend, and so act as to render your captivity supportable or your\nflight possible. It would require years to do again what I have done\nhere, and the results would be instantly destroyed if our jailers knew\nwe had communicated with each other. Besides, be assured, my dear\nEdmond, the dungeon I am about to leave will not long remain empty;\nsome other unfortunate being will soon take my place, and to him you\nwill appear like an angel of salvation. Perhaps he will be young,\nstrong, and enduring, like yourself, and will aid you in your escape,\nwhile I have been but a hindrance. You will no longer have half a dead\nbody tied to you as a drag to all your movements. At length Providence\nhas done something for you; he restores to you more than he takes away,\nand it was time I should die.”\n\nEdmond could only clasp his hands and exclaim, “Oh, my friend, my\nfriend, speak not thus!” and then resuming all his presence of mind,\nwhich had for a moment staggered under this blow, and his strength,\nwhich had failed at the words of the old man, he said, “Oh, I have\nsaved you once, and I will save you a second time!” And raising the\nfoot of the bed, he drew out the phial, still a third filled with the\nred liquor.\n\n“See,” he exclaimed, “there remains still some of the magic draught.\nQuick, quick! tell me what I must do this time; are there any fresh\ninstructions? Speak, my friend; I listen.”\n\n“There is not a hope,” replied Faria, shaking his head, “but no matter;\nGod wills it that man whom he has created, and in whose heart he has so\nprofoundly rooted the love of life, should do all in his power to\npreserve that existence, which, however painful it may be, is yet\nalways so dear.”\n\n“Oh, yes, yes!” exclaimed Dantès; “and I tell you that I will save you\nyet.”\n\n“Well, then, try. The cold gains upon me. I feel the blood flowing\ntowards my brain.

His fear was lest the governor, touched with\npity, might order him to be removed to better quarters, and thus\nseparate him from his young companion. But fortunately this was not the\ncase, and the governor left him, convinced that the poor madman, for\nwhom in his heart he felt a kind of affection, was only troubled with a\nslight indisposition.\n\nDuring this time, Edmond, seated on his bed with his head in his hands,\ntried to collect his scattered thoughts. Faria, since their first\nacquaintance, had been on all points so rational and logical, so\nwonderfully sagacious, in fact, that he could not understand how so\nmuch wisdom on all points could be allied with madness. Was Faria\ndeceived as to his treasure, or was all the world deceived as to Faria?\n\nDantès remained in his cell all day, not daring to return to his\nfriend, thinking thus to defer the moment when he should be convinced,\nonce for all, that the abbé was mad—such a conviction would be so\nterrible!\n\nBut, towards the evening after the hour for the customary visit had\ngone by, Faria, not seeing the young man appear, tried to move and get\nover the distance which separated them. Edmond shuddered when he heard\nthe painful efforts which the old man made to drag himself along; his\nleg was inert, and he could no longer make use of one arm. Edmond was\nobliged to assist him, for otherwise he would not have been able to\nenter by the small aperture which led to Dantès’ chamber.\n\n“Here I am, pursuing you remorselessly,” he said with a benignant\nsmile. “You thought to escape my munificence, but it is in vain. Listen\nto me.”\n\nEdmond saw there was no escape, and placing the old man on his bed, he\nseated himself on the stool beside him.\n\n“You know,” said the abbé, “that I was the secretary and intimate\nfriend of Cardinal Spada, the last of the princes of that name. I owe\nto this worthy lord all the happiness I ever knew. He was not rich,\nalthough the wealth of his family had passed into a proverb, and I\nheard the phrase very often, ‘As rich as a Spada.’ But he, like public\nrumor, lived on this reputation for wealth; his palace was my paradise.\nI was tutor to his nephews, who are dead; and when he was alone in the\nworld, I tried by absolute devotion to his will, to make up to him all\nhe had done for me during ten years of unremitting kindness. The\ncardinal’s house had no secrets for me. I had often seen my noble\npatron annotating ancient volumes, and eagerly searching amongst dusty\nfamily manuscripts. One day when I was reproaching him for his\nunavailing searches, and deploring the prostration of mind that\nfollowed them, he looked at me, and, smiling bitterly, opened a volume\nrelating to the History of the City "}, {"chunk_id": 107, "text": "e oldest and most powerful families of the fifteenth century; and in\nthose times, when other opportunities for investment were wanting, such\naccumulations of gold and jewels were by no means rare; there are at\nthis day Roman families perishing of hunger, though possessed of nearly\na million in diamonds and jewels, handed down by entail, and which they\ncannot touch.”\n\nEdmond thought he was in a dream—he wavered between incredulity and\njoy.\n\n“I have only kept this secret so long from you,” continued Faria, “that\nI might test your character, and then surprise you. Had we escaped\nbefore my attack of catalepsy, I should have conducted you to Monte\nCristo; now,” he added, with a sigh, “it is you who will conduct me\nthither. Well, Dantès, you do not thank me?”\n\n“This treasure belongs to you, my dear friend,” replied Dantès, “and to\nyou only. I have no right to it. I am no relation of yours.”\n\n“You are my son, Dantès,” exclaimed the old man. “You are the child of\nmy captivity. My profession condemns me to celibacy. God has sent you\nto me to console, at one and the same time, the man who could not be a\nfather, and the prisoner who could not get free.”\n\nAnd Faria extended the arm of which alone the use remained to him to\nthe young man, who threw himself upon his neck and wept.\n\n\n\n Chapter 19. The Third Attack\n\nNow that this treasure, which had so long been the object of the abbé’s\nmeditations, could insure the future happiness of him whom Faria really\nloved as a son, it had doubled its value in his eyes, and every day he\nexpatiated on the amount, explaining to Dantès all the good which, with\nthirteen or fourteen millions of francs, a man could do in these days\nto his friends; and then Dantès’ countenance became gloomy, for the\noath of vengeance he had taken recurred to his memory, and he reflected\nhow much ill, in these times, a man with thirteen or fourteen millions\ncould do to his enemies.\n\nThe abbé did not know the Island of Monte Cristo; but Dantès knew it,\nand had often passed it, situated twenty-five miles from Pianosa,\nbetween Corsica and the Island of Elba, and had once touched there.\nThis island was, always had been, and still is, completely deserted. It\nis a rock of almost conical form, which looks as though it had been\nthrust up by volcanic force from the depth to the surface of the ocean.\nDantès drew a plan of the island for Faria, and Faria gave Dantès\nadvice as to the means he should employ to recover the treasure. But\nDantès was far from being as enthusiastic and confident as the old man.\nIt was past a question now that Faria was not a lunatic, and the way in\nwhich he had achieved the discovery, which had given rise to the\nsuspicion of his madness, increased Edmond’s admiration of him; but at\nthe same time Dantès could not believe that the deposit, supposing it\nhad ever existed, still existed; and though he considered the treasure\nas by no means chimerical, he yet believed it was no longer there.\n\nHowever, as if fate resolved on depriving the prisoners of their last\nchance, and making them understand that they were condemned to\nperpetual imprisonment, a new misfortune befell them; the gallery on\nthe sea side, which had long been in ruins, was rebuilt. They had\nrepaired it completely, and stopped up with vast masses of stone the\nhole Dantès had partly filled in. But for this precaution, which, it\nwill be remembered, the abbé had made to Edmond, the misfortune would\nhave been still greater, for their attempt to escape would have been\ndetected, and they would undoubtedly have been separated. Thus a new, a\nstronger, and more inexorable barrier was interposed to cut off the\nrealization of their hopes.\n\n“You see,” said the young man, with an air of sorrowful resignation, to\nFaria, “that God deems it right to take from me any claim to merit for\nwhat you call my devotion to you. I have promised to remain forever\nwith you, and now I could not break my promise if I would. The treasure\nwill be no more mine than yours, and neither of"}, {"chunk_id": 97, "text": "ious moment should arrive; their greatest dread\nnow was lest the stone through which the sentry was doomed to fall\nshould give way before its right time, and this they had in some\nmeasure provided against by propping it up with a small beam which they\nhad discovered in the walls through which they had worked their way.\nDantès was occupied in arranging this piece of wood when he heard\nFaria, who had remained in Edmond’s cell for the purpose of cutting a\npeg to secure their rope-ladder, call to him in a tone indicative of\ngreat suffering. Dantès hastened to his dungeon, where he found him\nstanding in the middle of the room, pale as death, his forehead\nstreaming with perspiration, and his hands clenched tightly together.\n\n“Gracious heavens!” exclaimed Dantès, “what is the matter? what has\nhappened?”\n\n“Quick! quick!” returned the abbé, “listen to what I have to say.”\n\nDantès looked in fear and wonder at the livid countenance of Faria,\nwhose eyes, already dull and sunken, were surrounded by purple circles,\nwhile his lips were white as those of a corpse, and his very hair\nseemed to stand on end.\n\n“Tell me, I beseech you, what ails you?” cried Dantès, letting his\nchisel fall to the floor.\n\n“Alas,” faltered out the abbé, “all is over with me. I am seized with a\nterrible, perhaps mortal illness; I can feel that the paroxysm is fast\napproaching. I had a similar attack the year previous to my\nimprisonment. This malady admits but of one remedy; I will tell you\nwhat that is. Go into my cell as quickly as you can; draw out one of\nthe feet that support the bed; you will find it has been hollowed out\nfor the purpose of containing a small phial you will see there\nhalf-filled with a red-looking fluid. Bring it to me—or rather—no,\nno!—I may be found here, therefore help me back to my room while I have\nthe strength to drag myself along. Who knows what may happen, or how\nlong the attack may last?”\n\nIn spite of the magnitude of the misfortune which thus suddenly\nfrustrated his hopes, Dantès did not lose his presence of mind, but\ndescended into the passage, dragging his unfortunate companion with\nhim; then, half-carrying, half-supporting him, he managed to reach the\nabbé’s chamber, when he immediately laid the sufferer on his bed.\n\n“Thanks,” said the poor abbé, shivering as though his veins were filled\nwith ice. “I am about to be seized with a fit of catalepsy; when it\ncomes to its height I shall probably lie still and motionless as though\ndead, uttering neither sigh nor groan. On the other hand, the symptoms\nmay be much more violent, and cause me to fall into fearful\nconvulsions, foam at the mouth, and cry out loudly. Take care my cries\nare not heard, for if they are it is more than probable I should be\nremoved to another part of the prison, and we be separated forever.\nWhen I become quite motionless, cold, and rigid as a corpse, then, and\nnot before,—be careful about this,—force open my teeth with the knife,\npour from eight to ten drops of the liquor contained in the phial down\nmy throat, and I may perhaps revive.”\n\n“Perhaps!” exclaimed Dantès in grief-stricken tones.\n\n“Help! help!” cried the abbé, “I—I—die—I——”\n\n0229m\n\n\n\nSo sudden and violent was the fit that the unfortunate prisoner was\nunable to complete the sentence; a violent convulsion shook his whole\nframe, his eyes started from their sockets, his mouth was drawn on one\nside, his cheeks became purple, he struggled, foamed, dashed himself\nabout, and uttered the most dreadful cries, which, however, Dantès\nprevented from being heard by covering his head with the blanket. The\nfit lasted two hours; then, more helpless than an infant, and colder\nand paler than marble, more crushed and broken than a reed trampled\nunder foot, he fell back, doubled up in one last convulsion, and became\nas rigid as a corpse.\n\nEdmond waited till life seemed extinct in the body of his friend, then,\ntaking up the knife, he with difficulty forced open the closely fixed\njaws, carefully administered the appointed number of"}]}

I was generally liked on board,\nand had the sailors possessed the right of selecting a captain\nthemselves, I feel convinced their choice would have fallen on me.\nThere was only one person among the crew who had any feeling of\nill-will towards me. I had quarelled with him some time previously, and\nhad even challenged him to fight me; but he refused.”\n\n“Now we are getting on. And what was this man’s name?”\n\n“Danglars.”\n\n“What rank did he hold on board?”\n\n“He was supercargo.”\n\n“And had you been captain, should you have retained him in his\nemployment?”\n\n“Not if the choice had remained with me, for I had frequently observed\ninaccuracies in his accounts.”\n\n“Good again!

This proof of\nhis guilt may be procured by his immediate arrest, as the letter will\nbe found either about his person, at his father’s residence, or in his\ncabin on board the _Pharaon_.’”\n\nThe abbé shrugged his shoulders. “The thing is clear as day,” said he;\n“and you must have had a very confiding nature, as well as a good\nheart, not to have suspected the origin of the whole affair.”\n\n“Do you really think so? Ah, that would indeed be infamous.”\n\n“How did Danglars usually write?”\n\n“In a handsome, running hand.”\n\n“And how was the anonymous letter written?”\n\n“Backhanded.”\n\nAgain the abbé smiled. “Disguised.”\n\n“It was very boldly written, if disguised.”\n\n“Stop a bit,” said the abbé, taking up what he called his pen, and,\nafter dipping it into the ink, he wrote on a piece of prepared linen,\nwith his left hand, the first two or three words of the accusation.\nDantès drew back, and gazed on the abbé with a sensation almost\namounting to terror.\n\n“How very astonishing!” cried he at length. “Why your writing exactly\nresembles that of the accusation.”\n\n“Simply because that accusation had been written with the left hand;\nand I have noticed that——”\n\n“What?”\n\n“T"}, {"chunk_id": 26, "text": "the other; “he’s too stupid to imagine\nsuch a scheme.

I know she was loaded with\ncotton, and that she took in her freight at Alexandria from Pastret’s\nwarehouse, and at Smyrna from Pascal’s; that is all I was obliged to\nknow, and I beg I may not be asked for any further particulars.”\n\n“Now I recollect,” said the afflicted old father; “my poor boy told me\nyesterday he had got a small case of coffee, and another of tobacco for\nme!”\n\n“There, you see,” exclaimed Danglars. “Now the mischief is out; depend\nupon it the custom-house people went rummaging about the ship in our\nabsence, and discovered poor Dantès’ hidden treasures.”\n\nMercédès, however, paid no heed to this explanation of her lover’s\narrest. Her grief, which she had hitherto tried to restrain, now burst\nout in a violent fit of hysterical sobbing.\n\n“Come, come,” said the old man, “be comforted, my poor child; there is\nstill hope!”\n\n“Hope!” repeated Danglars.\n\n“Hope!” faintly murmured Fernand, but the word seemed to die away on\nhis pale agitated lips, and a convulsive spasm passed over his\ncountenance.\n\n“Good news! good news!” shouted forth one of the party stationed in the\nbalcony on the lookout. “Here comes M. Morrel back. No doubt, now, we\nshall hear that our friend is released!”\n\nMercédès and the old man rushed to meet the shipowner and greeted him\nat the door. He was very pale.\n\n“What news?” exclaimed a general burst of voices.\n\n“Alas, my friends,” replied M. Morrel, with a mournful shake of his\nhead, “the thing has assumed a more serious aspect than I expected.”\n\n“Oh, indeed—indeed, sir, he is innocent!” sobbed forth Mercédès.\n\n“That I believe!” answered M. Morrel; “but still he is charged——”\n\n“With what?” inquired the elder Dantès.\n\n“With being an agent of the Bonapartist faction!” Many of our readers\nmay be able to recollect how formidable such an accusation became in\nthe period at which our story is dated.\n\nA despairing cry escaped the pale lips of Mercédès; the old man sank\ninto a chair.\n\n“Ah, Danglars!” whispered Caderousse, “you have deceived me—the trick\nyou spoke of last night has been played; but I cannot suffer a poor old\nman or an innocent girl to die of grief through your fault. I am\ndetermined to tell them all about it.”\n\n“Be silent, you simpleton!” cried Danglars, grasping him by the arm,\n“or I will not answer even for your own safety. Who can tell whether\nDantès be innocent or guilty? The vessel did touch at Elba, where he\nquitted it, and passed a whole day in the island. Now, should any\nletters or other documents of a compromising character be found upon\nhim, will it not be taken for granted that all who uphold him are his\naccomplices?”\n\nWith the rapid instinct of selfishness, Caderousse readily perceived\nthe solidity of this mode of reasoning; he gazed, doubtfully,\nwistfully, on Danglars, and then caution supplanted generosity.\n\n“Suppose we wait a while, and see what comes of it,” said he, casting a\nbewildered look on his companion.\n\n“To be sure!” answered Danglars. “Let us wait, by all means.

As\nfor the count, he had fallen on his chair; it was evident that his legs\nrefused to support him.\n\n“‘Madame,’ said the president, ‘you have engaged to furnish the\ncommittee with some important particulars respecting the affair at\nYanina, and you have stated that you were an eyewitness of the\nevent.’—‘I was, indeed,’ said the stranger, with a tone of sweet\nmelancholy, and with the sonorous voice peculiar to the East.\n\n“‘But allow me to say that you must have been very young then.’—‘I was\nfour years old; but as those events deeply concerned me, not a single\ndetail has escaped my memory.’—‘In what manner could these events\nconcern you? and who are you, that they should have made so deep an\nimpression on you?’—‘On them depended my father’s life,’ replied she.\n‘I am Haydée, the daughter of Ali Tepelini, pasha of Yanina, and of\nVasiliki, his beloved wife.’\n\n40202m\n\n\n\n“The blush of mingled pride and modesty which suddenly suffused the\ncheeks of the young woman, the brilliancy of her eye, and her highly\nimportant communication, produced an indescribable effect on the\nassembly. As for the count, he could not have been more overwhelmed if\na thunderbolt had fallen at his feet and opened an immense gulf before\nhim.\n\n“‘Madame,’ replied the president, bowing with profound respect, ‘allow\nme to ask one question; it shall be the last: Can you prove the\nauthenticity of what you have now stated?’\n\n“‘I can, sir,’ said Haydée, drawing from under her veil a satin satchel\nhighly perfumed; ‘for here is the register of my birth, signed by my\nfather and his principal officers, and that of my baptism, my father\nhaving consented to my being brought up in my mother’s faith,—this\nlatter has been sealed by the grand primate of Macedonia and Epirus;\nand lastly (and perhaps the most important), the record of the sale of\nmy person and that of my mother to the Armenian merchant El-Kobbir, by\nthe French officer, who, in his infamous bargain with the Porte, had\nreserved as his part of the booty the wife and daughter of his\nbenefactor, whom he sold for the sum of four hundred thousand francs.’\nA greenish pallor spread over the count’s cheeks, and his eyes became\nbloodshot at these terrible imputations, which were listened to by the\nassembly with ominous silence.\n\n“Haydée, still calm, but with a calmness more dreadful than the anger\nof another would have been, handed to the president the record of her\nsale, written in Arabic. It had been supposed some of the papers might\nbe in the Arabian, Romaic, or Turkish language, and the interpreter of\nthe House was in attendance. One of the noble peers, who was familiar\nwith the Arabic language, having studied it during the famous Egyptian\ncampaign, followed with his eye as the translator read aloud:\n\n“‘I, El-Kobbir, a slave-merchant, and purveyor of the harem of his\nhighness, acknowledge having received for transmission to the sublime\nemperor, from the French lord, the Count of Monte Cristo, an emerald\nvalued at eight hundred thousand francs; as the ransom of a young\nChristian slave of eleven years of age, named Haydée, the acknowledged\ndaughter of the late lord Ali Tepelini, pasha of Yanina, and of\nVasiliki, his favorite; she having been sold to me seven years\npreviously, with her mother, who had died on arriving at\nConstantinople, by a French colonel in the service of the Vizier Ali\nTepelini, named Fernand Mondego. The above-mentioned purchase was made\non his highness’s account, whose mandate I had, for the sum of four\nhundred thousand francs.\n\n“‘Given at Constantinople, by authority of his highness, in the year\n1247 of the Hegira.\n\n“‘Signed, El-Kobbir.’\n\n“‘That this record should have all due authority, it shall bear"}, {"chunk_id": 179, "text": ", and let my gratitude remain in obscurity like your\ngood deeds.”\n\n20064m\n\n\n\nAnd with a smile expressive of supreme content, he left his\nhiding-place, and without being observed, descended one of the flights\nof steps provided for debarkation, and hailing three times, shouted\n“Jacopo, Jacopo, Jacopo!”\n\nThen a launch came to shore, took him on board, and conveyed him to a\nyacht splendidly fitted up, on whose deck he sprung with the activity\nof a sailor; thence he once again looked towards Morrel, who, weeping\nwith joy, was shaking hands most cordially with all the crowd around\nhim, and thanking with a look the unknown benefactor whom he seemed to\nbe seeking in the skies.\n\n“And now,” said the unknown, “farewell kindness, humanity, and\ngratitude! Farewell to all the feelings that expand the heart! I have\nbeen Heaven’s substitute to recompense the good—now the god of\nvengeance yields to me his power to punish the wicked!”\n\nAt these words he gave a signal, and, as if only awaiting this signal,\nthe yacht instantly put out to sea.\n\n\n\n Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor\n\nTowards the beginning of the year 1838, two young men belonging to the\nfirst society of Paris, the Viscount Albert de Morcerf and the Baron\nFranz d’Épinay, were at Florence. They had agreed to see the Carnival\nat Rome that year, and that Franz, who for the last three or four years\nhad inhabited Italy, should act as _cicerone_ to Albert.\n\nAs it is no inconsiderable affair to spend the Carnival at Rome,\nespecially when you have no great desire to sleep on the Piazza del\nPopolo, or the Campo Vaccino, they wrote to Signor Pastrini, the\nproprietor of the Hôtel de Londres, Piazza di Spagna, to reserve\ncomfortable apartments for them. Signor Pastrini replied that he had\nonly two rooms and a parlor on the third floor, which he offered at the\nlow charge of a louis per diem. They accepted his offer; but wishing to\nmake the best use of the time that was left, Albert started for Naples.\nAs for Franz, he remained at Florence, and after having passed a few\ndays in exploring the paradise of the Cascine, and spending two or\nthree evenings at the houses of the Florentine nobility, he took a\nfancy into his head (having already visited Corsica, the cradle of\nBonaparte) to visit Elba, the waiting-place of Napoleon.\n\nOne evening he cast off the painter of a sailboat from the iron ring\nthat secured it to the dock at Leghorn, wrapped himself in his coat and\nlay down, and said to the crew,—“To the Island of Elba!”\n\nThe boat shot out of the harbor like a bird and the next morning Franz\ndisembarked at Porto-Ferrajo. He traversed the island, after having\nfollowed the traces which the footsteps of the giant have left, and\nre-embarked for Marciana.\n\nTwo hours after he again landed at Pianosa, where he was assured that\nred partridges abounded. The sport was bad; Franz only succeeded in\nkilling a few partridges, and, like every unsuccessful sportsman, he\nreturned to the boat very much out of temper.\n\n“Ah, if your excellency chose,” said the captain, “you might have\ncapital sport.”\n\n“Where?”\n\n“Do you see that island?” continued the captain, pointing to a conical\npile rising from the indigo sea.\n\n“Well, what is this island?”\n\n“The Island of Monte Cristo.”\n\n“But I have no permission to shoot over this island.”\n\n“Your excellency does not require a permit, for the island is\nuninhabited.”\n\n“Ah, indeed!” said the young man. “A desert island in the midst of the\nMediterranean must be a curiosity.”\n\n“It is very natural; this island is a mass of rocks, and does not\ncontain an acre of land capable of cultivation.”\n\n“To whom does this island belong?”\n\n“To Tuscany.”\n\n“What game shall I find there!”\n\n“Thousands of wild goats.”\n\n“Who live upon the stones, I suppose,” said Franz with an incredulous\nsmile.\n\n“No, but by browsing the shrubs and trees that grow out of the crevices\nof the rocks.”\n\n“Where can I sleep?”\n\n“On shore in the grottos, or on board in your cloak; besides, if your\nexcellency pleases, we can leav"}]}

At\nthe end of three months he had learned to read. This was not enough—he\nmust now learn to write. The priest had a writing teacher at Rome make\nthree alphabets—one large, one middling, and one small; and pointed out\nto him that by the help of a sharp instrument he could trace the\nletters on a slate, and thus learn to write. The same evening, when the\nflock was safe at the farm, the little Luigi hastened to the smith at\nPalestrina, took a large nail, heated and sharpened it, and formed a\nsort of stylus. The next morning he gathered an armful of pieces of\nslate and began. At the end of three months he had learned to write.\nThe curate, astonished at his quickness and intelligence, made him a\npresent of pens, paper, and a penknife. This demanded new effort, but\nnothing compared to the first; at the end of a week he wrote as well\nwith this pen as with the stylus. The curate related the incident to\nthe Count of San-Felice, who sent for the little shepherd, made him\nread and write before him, ordered his attendant to let him eat with\nthe domestics, and to give him two piastres a month. With this, Luigi\npurchased books and pencils. He applied his imitative powers to\neverything, and, like Giotto, when young, he drew on his slate sheep,\nhouses, and trees. Then, with his knife, he began to carve all sorts of\nobjects in wood; it was thus that Pinelli, the famous sculptor, had\ncommenced.\n\n20105m\n\n\n\n“A girl of six or seven—that is, a little younger than Vampa—tended\nsheep on a farm near Palestrina; she was an orphan, born at Valmontone\nand was named Teresa. The two children met, sat down near each other,\nlet their flocks mingle together, played, laughed, and conversed\ntogether; in the evening they separated the Count of San-Felice’s flock\nfrom those of Baron Cervetri, and the children returned to their\nrespective farms, promising to meet the next morning. The next day they\nkept their word, and thus they grew up together. Vampa was twelve, and\nTeresa eleven. And yet their natural disposition revealed itself.\nBeside his taste for the fine arts, which Luigi had carried as far as\nhe could in his solitude, he was given to alternating fits of sadness\nand enthusiasm, was often angry and capricious, and always sarcastic.\nNone of the lads of Pampinara, Palestrina, or Valmontone had been able\nto gain any influence over him or even to become his companion. His\ndisposition (always inclined to exact concessions rather than to make\nthem) kept him aloof from all friendships. Teresa alone ruled by a\nlook, a word, a gesture, this impetuous character, which yielded\nbeneath the hand of a woman, and which beneath the hand of a man might\nhave broken, but could never have been bended. Teresa was lively and\ngay, but coquettish to excess. The two piastres that Luigi received\nevery month from the Count of San-Felice’s steward, and the price of\nall the little carvings in wood he sold at Rome, were expended in\near-rings, necklaces, and gold hairpins. So that, thanks to her\nfriend’s generosity, Teresa was the most beautiful and the best-attired\npeasant near Rome.\n\n“The two children grew up together, passing all their time with each\nother, and giving themselves up to the wild ideas of their different\ncharacters. Thus, in all their dreams, their wishes, and their\nconversations, Vampa saw himself the captain of a vessel, general of an\narmy, or governor of a province. Teresa saw herself rich, superbly\nattired, and attended by a train of liveried domestics. Then, when they\nhad thus passed the day in building castles in the air, they separated\ntheir flocks, and descended from the elevation of their dreams to the\nreality of their humble position.\n\n“One day the young shepherd told the count’s steward that he had seen a\nwolf come out of the Sabine mountains, and prowl ar"}, {"chunk_id": 473, "text": "\ntalent are they celebrated? You know there are different sorts.”\n\n“That tall, harsh-looking man is very learned, he discovered, in the\nneighborhood of Rome, a kind of lizard with a vertebra more than\nlizards usually have, and he immediately laid his discovery before the\nInstitute. The thing was discussed for a long time, but finally decided\nin his favor. I can assure you the vertebra made a great noise in the\nlearned world, and the gentleman, who was only a knight of the Legion\nof Honor, was made an officer.”\n\n“Come,” said Monte Cristo, “this cross seems to me to be wisely\nawarded. I suppose, had he found another additional vertebra, they\nwould have made him a commander.”\n\n“Very likely,” said Albert.\n\n“And who can that person be who has taken it into his head to wrap\nhimself up in a blue coat embroidered with green?”\n\n“Oh, that coat is not his own idea; it is the Republic’s, which deputed\nDavid12 to devise a uniform for the Academicians.”\n\n“Indeed?” said Monte Cristo; “so this gentleman is an Academician?”\n\n“Within the last week he has been made one of the learned assembly.”\n\n“And what is his especial talent?”\n\n“His talent? I believe he thrusts pins through the heads of rabbits, he\nmakes fowls eat madder, and punches the spinal marrow out of dogs with\nwhalebone.”\n\n“And he is made a member of the Academy of Sciences for this?”\n\n“No; of the French Academy.”\n\n“But what has the French Academy to do with all this?”\n\n“I was going to tell you. It seems——”\n\n“That his experiments have very considerably advanced the cause of\nscience, doubtless?”\n\n“No; that his style of writing is very good.”\n\n“This must be very flattering to the feelings of the rabbits into whose\nheads he has thrust pins, to the fowls whose bones he has dyed red, and\nto the dogs whose spinal marrow he has punched out?”\n\nAlbert laughed.\n\n“And the other one?” demanded the count.\n\n“That one?”\n\n“Yes, the third.”\n\n“The one in the dark blue coat?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“He is a colleague of the count, and one of the most active opponents\nto the idea of providing the Chamber of Peers with a uniform. He was\nvery successful upon that question. He stood badly with the Liberal\npapers, but his noble opposition to the wishes of the court is now\ngetting him into favor with the journalists. They talk of making him an\nambassador.”\n\n30303m\n\n\n\n“And what are his claims to the peerage?”\n\n“He has composed two or three comic operas, written four or five\narticles in the _Siècle_, and voted five or six years on the\nministerial side.”\n\n“Bravo, viscount,” said Monte Cristo, smiling; “you are a delightful\n_cicerone_. And now you will do me a favor, will you not?”\n\n“What is it?”\n\n“Do not introduce me to any of these gentlemen; and should they wish\nit, you will warn me.” Just then the count felt his arm pressed. He\nturned round; it was Danglars.\n\n“Ah! is it you, baron?” said he.\n\n“Why do you call me baron?” said Danglars; “you know that I care\nnothing for my title. I am not like you, viscount; you like your title,\ndo you not?”\n\n“Certainly,” replied Albert, “seeing that without my title I should be\nnothing; while you, sacrificing the baron, would still remain the\nmillionaire.”\n\n“Which seems to me the finest title under the royalty of July,” replied\nDanglars.\n\n“Unfortunately,” said Monte Cristo, “one’s title to a millionaire does\nnot last for life, like that of baron, peer of France, or academician;\nfor example, the millionaires Franck & Poulmann, of Frankfurt, who have\njust become bankrupts.”\n\n“Indeed?” said Danglars, becoming pale.\n\n“Yes; I received the news this evening by a courier. I had about a\nmillion in their hands, but, warned in time, I withdrew it a month\nago.”\n\n“Ah, _mon Dieu!_” exclaimed Danglars, “they have drawn on me for\n200,000 francs!”\n\n“Well, you can throw out the draft; their signature is worth five per\ncent.”\n\n“Yes, but it is too late,” said Danglars, “I have honored their bills.”\n\n“Then,” said Monte Cristo, “here are 200,000 francs gone after——”\n\n“Hush, do not mention these things,” said Da"}, {"chunk_id": 81, "text": "dled and\ninvigorated by his contact with one so warm and ardent. He thanked him\nwith grateful cordiality for his kindly welcome, although he must at\nthat moment have been suffering bitterly to find another dungeon where\nhe had fondly reckoned on discovering a means of regaining his liberty.\n\n“Let us first see,” said he, “whether it is possible to remove the\ntraces of my entrance here—our future tranquillity depends upon our\njailers being entirely ignorant of it.”\n\nAdvancing to the opening, he stooped and raised the stone easily in\nspite of its weight; then, fitting it into its place, he said:\n\n“You removed this stone very carelessly; but I suppose you had no tools\nto aid you.”\n\n“Why,” exclaimed Dantès, with astonishment, “do you possess any?”\n\n“I made myself some; and with the exception of a file, I have all that\nare necessary,—a chisel, pincers, and lever.”\n\n0201m\n\n\n\n“Oh, how I should like to see these products of your industry and\npatience.”\n\n“Well, in the first place, here is my chisel.”\n\nSo saying, he displayed a sharp strong blade, with a handle made of\nbeechwood.\n\n“And with what did you contrive to make that?” inquired Dantès.\n\n“With one of the clamps of my bedstead; and this very tool has sufficed\nme to hollow out the road by which I came hither, a distance of about\nfifty feet.”\n\n“Fifty feet!” responded Dantès, almost terrified.\n\n“Do not speak so loud, young man—don’t speak so loud. It frequently\noccurs in a state prison like this, that persons are stationed outside\nthe doors of the cells purposely to overhear the conversation of the\nprisoners.”\n\n“But they believe I am shut up alone here.”\n\n“That makes no difference.”\n\n“And you say that you dug your way a distance of fifty feet to get\nhere?”\n\n“I do; that is about the distance that separates your chamber from\nmine; only, unfortunately, I did not curve aright; for want of the\nnecessary geometrical instruments to calculate my scale of proportion,\ninstead of taking an ellipsis of forty feet, I made it fifty. I\nexpected, as I told you, to reach the outer wall, pierce through it,\nand throw myself into the sea; I have, however, kept along the corridor\non which your chamber opens, instead of going beneath it. My labor is\nall in vain, for I find that the corridor looks into a courtyard filled\nwith soldiers.”\n\n“That’s true,” said Dantès; “but the corridor you speak of only bounds\n_one_ side of my cell; there are three others—do you know anything of\ntheir situation?”\n\n“This one is built against the solid rock, and it would take ten\nexperienced miners, duly furnished with the requisite tools, as many\nyears to perforate it. This adjoins the lower part of the governor’s\napartments, and were we to work our way through, we should only get\ninto some lock-up cellars, where we must necessarily be recaptured. The\nfourth and last side of your cell faces on—faces on—stop a minute, now\nwhere does it face?”\n\nThe wall of which he spoke was the one in which was fixed the loophole\nby which light was admitted to the chamber. This loophole, which\ngradually diminished in size as it approached the outside, to an\nopening through which a child could not have passed, was, for better\nsecurity, furnished with three iron bars, so as to quiet all\napprehensions even in the mind of the most suspicious jailer as to the\npossibility of a prisoner’s escape. As the stranger asked the question,\nhe dragged the table beneath the window.\n\n“Climb up,” said he to Dantès.\n\nThe young man obeyed, mounted on the table, and, divining the wishes of\nhis companion, placed his back securely against the wall and held out\nboth hands. The stranger, whom as yet Dantès knew only by the number of\nhis cell, sprang up with an agility by no means to be expected in a\nperson of his years, and, light and steady on his feet as a cat or a\nlizard, climbed from the table to the outstretched hands of Dantès, and\nfrom them to his shoulders; then, bending double, for the ceiling of\nthe dungeon prevented him from holding himself erect, he managed t"}, {"chunk_id": 202, "text": "ons, Vampa saw himself the captain of a vessel, general of an\narmy, or governor of a province.

The\nsteward gave him a gun; this was what Vampa longed for. This gun had an\nexcellent barrel, made at Brescia, and carrying a ball with the\nprecision of an English rifle; but one day the count broke the stock,\nand had then cast the gun aside. This, however, was nothing to a\nsculptor like Vampa; he examined the broken stock, calculated what\nchange it would require to adapt the gun to his shoulder, and made a\nfresh stock, so beautifully carved that it would have fetched fifteen\nor twenty piastres, had he chosen to sell it. But nothing could be\nfarther from his thoughts.\n\n“For a long time a gun had been the young man’s greatest ambition. In\nevery country where independence has taken the place of liberty, the\nfirst desire of a manly heart is to possess a weapon, which at once\nrenders him capable of defence or attack, and, by rendering its owner\nterrible, often makes him feared. From this moment Vampa devoted all\nhis leisure time to perfecting himself in the use of his precious\nweapon; he purchased powder and ball, and everything served him for a\nmark—the trunk of some old and moss-grown olive-tree, that grew on the\nSabine mountains; the fox, as he quitted his earth on some marauding\nexcursion; the eagle that soared above their heads: and thus he soon\nbecame so expert, that Teresa overcame the terror she at first felt at\nthe report, and amused herself by watching him direct the ball wherever\nhe pleased, with as much accuracy as if he placed it by hand.\n\n20107m\n\n\n\n“One evening a wolf emerged from a pine-wood near which they were\nusually stationed, but the wolf had scarcely advanced ten yards ere he\nwas dead. Proud of this exploit, Vampa took the dead animal on his\nshoulders, and carried him to the farm. These exploits had gained Luigi\nconsiderable reputation. The man of superior abilities always finds\nadmirers, go where he will. He was spoken of as the most adroit, the\nstrongest, and the most courageous _contadino_ for ten leagues around;\nand although Teresa was universally allowed to be the most beautiful\ngirl of the Sabines, no one had ever spoken to her of love, because it\nwas known that she was beloved by Vampa. And yet the two young people\nhad never declared their affection; they had grown together like two\ntrees whose roots are mingled, whose branches intertwined, and whose\nintermingled perfume rises to the heavens. Only their wish to see each\nother had become a necessity, and they would have preferred death to a\nday’s separation.\n\n“Teresa was sixteen, and Vampa seventeen. About this time, a band of\nbrigands that had established itself in the Lepini mountains began to\nbe much spoken of. The brigands have never been really extirpated from\nthe neighborhood of Rome. Sometimes a chief is wanted, but when a chief\npresents himself he rarely has to wait long for a band of followers.\n\n“The celebrated Cucumetto, pursued in the Abruzzo, driven out of the\nkingdom of Naples, where he had carried on a regular war, had crossed\nthe Garigliano, like Manfred, and had taken refuge on the banks of the\nAmasine between Sonnino and Juperno. He strove to collect a band of\nfollowers, and followed the footsteps of Decesaris and Gasparone, whom\nhe hoped to surpass. Many young men of Palestrina, Frascati, and\nPampinara had disappeared. Their disappearance at first caused much\ndisquietude; but it was soon known that they had joined Cucumetto.\nAfter some time Cucumetto became the object of universal attention; the\nmost extraordinary traits of feroci"}, {"chunk_id": 431, "text": " delicacy that nature alone could produce. The baroness\nwas astonished.\n\n“Why,” said she, “you could plant one of the chestnut-trees in the\nTuileries inside!

It is the work of\nanother age, constructed by the genii of earth and water.”\n\n“How so?—at what period can that have been?”\n\n“I do not know; I have only heard that an emperor of China had an oven\nbuilt expressly, and that in this oven twelve jars like this were\nsuccessively baked. Two broke, from the heat of the fire; the other ten\nwere sunk three hundred fathoms deep into the sea. The sea, knowing\nwhat was required of her, threw over them her weeds, encircled them\nwith coral, and encrusted them with shells; the whole was cemented by\ntwo hundred years beneath these almost impervious depths, for a\nrevolution carried away the emperor who wished to make the trial, and\nonly left the documents proving the manufacture of the jars and their\ndescent into the sea. At the end of two hundred years the documents\nwere found, and they thought of bringing up the jars. Divers descended\nin machines, made expressly on the discovery, into the bay where they\nwere thrown; but of ten three only remained, the rest having been\nbroken by the waves. I am fond of these jars, upon which, perhaps,\nmisshapen, frightful monsters have fixed their cold, dull eyes, and in\nwhich myriads of small fish have slept, seeking a refuge from the\npursuit of their enemies.”\n\nMeanwhile, Danglars, who had cared little for curiosities, was\nmechanically tearing off the blossoms of a splendid orange-tree, one\nafter another. When he had finished with the orange-tree, he began at\nthe cactus; but this, not being so easily plucked as the orange-tree,\npricked him dreadfully. He shuddered, and rubbed his eyes as though\nawaking from a dream.\n\n“Sir,” said Monte Cristo to him, “I do not recommend my pictures to\nyou, who possess such splendid paintings; but, nevertheless, here are\ntwo by Hobbema, a Paul Potter, a Mieris, two by Gerard Douw, a Raphael,\na Van Dyck, a Zurbaran, and two or three by Murillo, worth looking at.”\n\n“Stay,” said Debray; “I recognize this Hobbema.”\n\n“Ah, indeed!”\n\n“Yes; it was proposed for the Museum.”\n\n“Which, I believe, does not contain one?” said Monte Cristo.\n\n“No; and yet they refused to buy it.”\n\n“Why?” said Château-Renaud.\n\n“You pretend not to know,—because government was not rich enough.”\n\n“Ah, pardon me,” said Château-Renaud; “I have heard of these things\nevery day during the last eight years, and I cannot understand them\nyet.”\n\n“You will, by and by,” said Debray.\n\n“I think not,” replied Château-Renaud.\n\n“Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti and Count Andrea Cavalcanti,” announced\nBaptistin.\n\nA black satin stock, fresh from the maker’s hands, gray moustaches, a\nbold eye, a major’s uniform, ornamented with three medals and five\ncrosses—in fact, the thorough bearing of an old soldier—such was the\nappearance of Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti, that tender father with whom\nwe are already acquainted.

Glenarvan gazed at him\nwith a dark foreboding.\n\n\"He is leaving us!\" cried he, seeing Thalcave gather up his reins as\nthough he were about to mount.\n\n\"He? never!\" said Robert.\n\nIn truth the Indian was about to make a venture, not to leave his\nfriends, but to save them by sacrificing himself. Thaouka was ready.\nHe champed his bit; he pranced; his eyes, full of a fiery spirit, shot\nforth lightning flashes; he understood his master.\n\nJust as the Indian was seizing the mane of his horse, Glenarvan caught\nhim by the arm with a convulsive grasp.\n\n\"You are going?\" said he, pointing to the plain, which was now deserted.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the Indian, who comprehended the gesture of his\ncompanion; and, with vehement gesticulations which were however\nperfectly intelligible, he added a few words in Spanish, which\nsignified: \"Thaouka--good horse--swift--will draw the wolves after him.\"\n\n[Illustration: Frightful howls resounded. The wolves, starting on the\ntrack of the horse, fled into the darkness with a terrible speed.]\n\n\"Ha! Thalcave!\" cried Glenarvan.\n\n\"Quick, quick!\" continued the Indian; while Glenarvan said to Robert,\nin a voice broken by emotion,--\n\n\"Robert, my lad, you hear! He will sacrifice himself for us; he will\nrush out over the plain, and turn aside the fury of the wolves upon\nhimself.\"\n\n\"Friend Thalcave,\" replied Robert, looking imploringly at the\nPatagonian, \"friend Thalcave, do not leave us!\"\n\n\"No,\" said Glenarvan, \"he will not leave us.\"\n\nAnd, turning to the Indian, he added, pointing to the terrified horses\ncrowding against the stakes,--\n\n\"Let us go together.\"\n\n\"No,\" said the Indian, who was not mistaken as to the meaning of these\nwords. \"Bad beasts--frightened--Thaouka--good horse.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Glenarvan. \"Thalcave shall not leave, Robert. He\nshows me what I have to do. It is my duty to go, and his to remain with\nyou.\"\n\nThen, seizing Thaouka's bridle, he added,--\n\n\"I will go.\"\n\n\"No,\" replied the Patagonian, calmly.\n\n\"I tell you,\" cried Glenarvan, taking the bridle from the hands of the\nIndian, \"I will go. Save this boy! I trust him to you, Thalcave!\"\n\nGlenarvan, in his excitement, mingled English and Spanish together. But\nwhat matters the language? In such a terrible situation, signs tell\nall, and men quickly understand each other.\n\n[Sidenote: SAFETY FOR TWO.]\n\nHowever, Thalcave resisted, and the discussion was prolonged. The\ndanger was increasing every moment. Already the broken stakes were\nyielding to the teeth and claws of the wolves. But neither Glenarvan\nnor Thalcave appeared willing to yield. The Indian had drawn Glenarvan\ntowards the entrance of the inclosure. He pointed to the plain, now\nfree from wolves. In his animated language, he explained that not "}, {"chunk_id": 51, "text": " Paganel, he did not leave the Indian. He became Thalcave's\nshadow, and could not remain quiet in the presence of a real\nPatagonian, in comparison with whom he would have passed for a dwarf.\nHe overwhelmed the grave Indian with Spanish phrases, to which the\nlatter quietly listened. The geographer studied this time without a\nbook, and was often heard repeating words aloud.\n\n\"If I do not get the accent,\" said he to the major, \"you must not be\nangry with me. Who would have thought that one day a Patagonian would\nteach me Spanish!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\nNEWS OF THE LOST CAPTAIN.\n\n\nAt eight o'clock the next morning Thalcave gave the signal for\ndeparture. The slope was gradual, and the travelers had only to descend\na gentle declivity to the sea.\n\nWhen the Patagonian declined the horse that Glenarvan offered him, the\nlatter thought that he preferred to go on foot, according to the custom\nof certain guides; and indeed, his long legs ought to have made walking\neasy. But he was mistaken.\n\nAt the moment of departure Thalcave whistled in a peculiar manner.\nImmediately a magnificent Argentine horse, of superb form, issued from\na small wood near by, and approached at the call of his master. The\nanimal was perfectly beautiful. His brown color indicated a sound,\nspirited and courageous beast. He had a small and elegantly poised\nhead, widely opening nostrils, a fiery eye, large hams, swelling\nwithers, broad breast, long pasterns, in short, all the qualities that\nconstitute strength and suppleness. The major, like a perfect horseman,\nadmired unreservedly this specimen of the horses of the plains. This\nbeautiful creature was called Thaouka, which means \"bird\" in the\nPatagonian language, and he justly merited this appellation.\n\n[Sidenote: A FRESH START.]\n\nWhen Thalcave was in the saddle, the horse pranced with spirited grace,\nand the Patagonian, a skillful rider, was magnificent to behold. His\noutfit comprised two weapons of the chase, the \"bolas\" and the lasso.\nThe bolas consists of three balls tied together by a leathern string,\nwhich are fastened to the front of the saddle. The Indians frequently\nthrow them the distance of a hundred paces at the animal or enemy that\nthey are pursuing, and with such precision that they twist about their\nlegs and bring them to the ground. It is, therefore, in their hands a\nformidable instrument, and they handle it with surprising dexterity.\nThe lasso, on the contrary, does not leave the hand that wields it. It\nconsists simply of a leathern thong thirty feet in length, terminating\nin a slip-noose which works upon an iron ring. The right hand throws\nthe slip-noose, while the left hand holds the remainder of the lasso,\nthe end of which is firmly tied to the saddle. A long carbine in a\nsling completed the Patagonian's armament.\n\nThalcave, without observing the admiration caused by his natural\ngrace, ease and courage, took the lead, and the party advanced, now\nat a gallop, and now at a walk, for their horses seemed entirely\nunaccustomed to trotting. Robert mounted with much boldness, and\nspeedily convinced Glenarvan of his ability to keep his seat.\n\nOn issuing from the gorges of the Andes, they encountered a great\nnumber of sand-ridges, called \"medanos,\" real waves incessantly\nagitated by the wind, when the roots of the herbage did not confine\nthem to the earth. This sand is of an extreme fineness; and, at the\nleast breath, they saw it float away in light clouds, or form regular\nsand-columns which rose to a considerable height. This spectacle caused\npleasure as well as annoyance to the eyes. Pleasure, for nothing was\nmore curious than these columns, wandering over the plain, struggling,\nmingling, sinking and rising in inexpressible confusion; and annoyance,\nsince an impalpable dust emanated from these innumerable medanos and\npenetrated the eyelids, however tightly they were closed.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThis phenomenon continued during a great part of the day. Nevertheless,\nthey advanced rapidly, and towards six o'clock the A"}, {"chunk_id": 77, "text": "fled away in the track of Thaouka.\n\nIt was time. Five miles to the south a high and broad wall of water\nwas rushing over the plain, which was fast becoming an ocean. The tall\ngrass disappeared as before the scythe, and the tufts of mimosas, torn\nup by the current, separated and formed floating islands. The mass of\nwaters spread itself in broad waves of irresistible power. The dikes of\nthe great rivers had evidently given way, and perhaps the waters of the\nColorado and Rio Negro were now mingling in a common stream.\n\nThe wall of water descried by Thalcave advanced with the speed of a\nrace-horse. The travelers fled before it like a cloud driven by the\nstorm. Their eyes sought in vain a place of refuge. Sky and water\nmingled together on the horizon. The horses, excited by the danger,\ndashed along in a mad gallop, so that their riders could scarcely keep\ntheir seats. Glenarvan frequently glanced behind him.\n\n\"The water is overtaking us,\" he thought.\n\n\"Quick! quick!\" cried Thalcave.\n\n[Sidenote: THE ARK.]\n\nThe unfortunate beasts were urged to a swifter pace. From their flanks,\nlacerated with the spur, flowed bright red streams, which marked\ntheir course on the water by long, crimson lines. They stumbled in\nthe hollows of the ground; they were entangled in the hidden grass;\nthey fell and rose again continually. The depth of the water sensibly\nincreased. Long surges announced the on-rush of the mass of water that\ntossed its foaming crests less than two miles distant.\n\nFor a quarter of an hour this final struggle against the most terrible\nof elements was prolonged. The fugitives could keep no account of the\ndistance they had traversed; but, judging by the rapidity of their\nflight, it must have been considerable.\n\nMeantime the horses, immersed to their breasts, could no longer\nadvance without extreme difficulty. Glenarvan, Paganel, Austin, all\nbelieved themselves lost, victims of the horrible death of unfortunates\nabandoned at sea. Their animals began to lose their footing; six feet\nof water was sufficient to drown them.\n\nWe must forbear to picture the acute anguish of these eight men\novertaken by a rising inundation. They felt their powerlessness to\nstruggle against these convulsions of nature, superior to human\nstrength. Their safety was no longer in their own hands.\n\nFive minutes after, the horses were swimming, while the current alone\ncarried them along with irresistible force and furious swiftness. All\nsafety seemed impossible, when the voice of the major was heard.\n\n\"A tree!\" said he.\n\n\"A tree!\" cried Glenarvan.\n\n\"Yes, yonder!\" replied Thalcave, and he pointed northward to a kind of\ngigantic walnut-tree, which rose solitary from the midst of the waters.\n\nHis companions had no need to be urged. This tree that was opportunely\npresented to them they must reach at all hazards. The horses probably\ncould not accomplish the distance; but the men, at least, could be\nsaved,--the current would carry them.\n\nAt that moment Tom Austin's horse gave a stifled neigh and disappeared.\nHis rider, extricating himself from the stirrups, began to swim\nvigorously.\n\n\"Cling to my saddle!\" cried Glenarvan to him.\n\n\"Thanks, my lord,\" replied he, \"my arms are strong.\"\n\n\"Your horse, Robert?\" continued Glenarvan, turning towards the boy.\n\n\"All right, my lord, all right! He swims like a fish.\"\n\n\"Attention!\" cried the major, in a loud voice.\n\nThis word was scarcely pronounced, when the enormous wall of water\nreached them. A huge wave, forty feet high, overwhelmed the fugitives\nwith a terrible roar. Men and beasts, everything, disappeared in a\nwhirlpool of foam. A ponderous liquid mass engulfed them in its furious\ntide. When the deluge had passed, the men regained the surface, and\nrapidly counted their numbers; but the horses, except Thaouka, had\ndisappeared forever.\n\n\"Courage! courage!\" cried Glenarvan, who supported Paganel with one arm\nand swam with the other.\n\n\"All right! all right!\" replied the worthy geographer; \"indeed I am not\nsorry----\"\n\nWhat was he not "}, {"chunk_id": 152, "text": " the horses are dead.\"\n\n\"The poison is not far away.\"\n\n\"There is enough here to settle an entire troop of cavalry. This\ngastrolobium is a useful plant.\"\n\n\"Then they were silent,\" added MacNabb, \"and departed. I wanted to know\nmore: I followed them. The conversation soon began again. 'A cunning\nman, this Ben Joyce,' said the farrier; 'a famous quartermaster, with\nhis invented shipwreck. If his plan succeeds, it will be a stroke of\nfortune. Devilish Ayrton! Call him Ben Joyce, for he has well earned\nhis name.' These rascals then left the wood of gum-trees. I knew what\nI wished, and returned to the encampment with the certainty that all\nthe convicts in Australia are not reformed, in spite of Paganel's\narguments.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Glenarvan, whose face was pale with anger, \"Ayrton has\nbrought us here to rob and assassinate us?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the major.\n\n\"And, since leaving the Wimerra, his band has followed and watched us,\nwaiting for a favorable opportunity?\"\n\n[Sidenote: FROM DEPTH TO DEPTH.]\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"But this wretch is not, then, a sailor of the Britannia? He has stolen\nhis name and contract?\"\n\nAll eyes were turned towards MacNabb, who must have considered this\nmatter.\n\n\"These,\" replied he, in his calm voice, \"are the proofs that can be\nderived from this obscure state of affairs. In my opinion this man's\nreal name is Ayrton. Ben Joyce is his fighting title. It is certain\nthat he knows Harry Grant, and has been quartermaster on board the\nBritannia. These facts, proved already by the precise details given\nby Ayrton, are still further corroborated by the conversation of the\nconvicts that I have related. Let us not, therefore, be led astray\nby vain conjectures, but only be certain that Ayrton is Ben Joyce, a\nsailor of the Britannia, now chief of a band of convicts.\"\n\nThe major's explanation was accepted as conclusive.\n\n\"Now,\" replied Glenarvan, \"will you tell me how and why Harry Grant's\nquartermaster is in Australia?\"\n\n\"How, I do not know,\" said MacNabb; \"and the police declare they know\nno more than I on the subject. Why, it is also impossible for me to\nsay. Here is a mystery that the future will explain.\"\n\n\"The police do not even know the identity of Ayrton and Ben Joyce,\"\nsaid Captain Mangles.\n\n\"You are right, John,\" replied the major; \"and such information would\nbe likely to facilitate their search.\"\n\n\"This unfortunate, then,\" remarked Lady Helena, \"intruded into\nO'Moore's farm with a criminal intention?\"\n\n\"There is no doubt of it,\" continued MacNabb. \"He was meditating\nsome hostile attack upon the Irishman, when a better opportunity was\noffered. Chance threw us in his way. He heard Glenarvan's story of the\nshipwreck, and, like a bold man, he promptly decided to take part in\nthe expedition. At the Wimerra he communicated with one of his friends,\nthe farrier of Black Point, and thus left distinguishable traces of\nour course. His band followed us. A poisonous plant enabled him to\ngradually kill our oxen and horses. Then, at the proper moment, he\nentangled us in the marshes of the Snowy, and surrendered us to the\nconvicts he commanded.\"\n\nEverything possible had been said concerning Ben Joyce. His past had\njust been reviewed by the major, and the wretch appeared as he was,--a\nbold and formidable criminal. His intentions had been clearly proved,\nand required, on the part of Glenarvan, extreme vigilance. Fortunately,\nthere was less to fear from the detected bandit than the secret traitor.\n\nBut one serious fact appeared from this explanation. No one had yet\nthought of it; only Mary Grant, disregarding the past, looked forward\nto the future. Captain Mangles first saw her pale and disconsolate. He\nunderstood what was passing in her mind.\n\n\"Miss Mary!\" cried he, \"you are weeping!\"\n\n\"What is the matter, my child?\" asked Lady Helena.\n\n\"My father, madam, my father!\" replied the young girl.\n\nShe could not continue. But a sudden revelation dawned on the mind of\neach. They comprehended Mary's grief, why the tears flowed from her\neyes, why the "}, {"chunk_id": 62, "text": "arvan, Robert, and Thalcave had yielded to the common law, and,\nstretched on their thick beds of grass, they enjoyed a refreshing\nsleep. The horses, overcome with fatigue, had lain down on the ground:\nThaouka alone, like a true blooded horse, slept standing, spirited in\nrepose as in action, and ready to start at the least sign from his\nmaster. Perfect tranquillity reigned within the inclosure, and the\nembers of the night-fire, as they gradually died out, cast their last\nrays over the silent obscurity.\n\nAbout ten o'clock, after a short sleep, the Indian awoke. His eyes\nbecame fixed beneath his lowered eyebrows, and his head was turned in a\nlistening attitude towards the plain. He seemed endeavoring to detect\nsome scarcely perceptible sound. A vague uneasiness was soon expressed\non his face, usually so calm. Had he perceived the approach of prowling\nIndians, or the coming of jaguars, water-tigers, and other formidable\nbeasts which are numerous in the neighborhood of rivers? This last\npossibility doubtless appeared plausible to him, for he cast a rapid\nglance over the combustible materials piled in the inclosure, and his\nanxiety increased. In fact, all this dry bedding would quickly be\nconsumed, and could not long intimidate the audacious animals.\n\nAccording to this conjecture, Thalcave had only to await the progress\nof events, which he did, half reclining, his head resting on his hands,\nhis elbows on his knees, his eyes motionless, in the attitude of a man\nwhom a sudden anxiety has awakened from sleep.\n\nAn hour passed. Any other person but Thalcave, reassured by the outward\nsilence, would have lain down again. But where a stranger would have\nsuspected nothing, the highly-trained senses and natural instinct of\nthe Indian foresaw the coming danger.\n\nWhile he was listening and watching, Thaouka gave a low neigh. His\nnose was stretched towards the entrance to the ramada. The Patagonian\nsuddenly started.\n\n\"Thaouka has scented some enemy,\" said he.\n\nHe arose and scanned the plain attentively. Silence still reigned, but\nnot tranquillity. Thalcave discerned shadows moving noiselessly among\nthe tufts of grass. Here and there glittered luminous points, which\nspread on all sides, now fading away, and now gleaming forth again. You\nwould have thought fantastic elves were dancing on the surface of an\nimmense lagoon. A stranger would doubtless have taken these flitting\nsparks for glow-worms, which shine, when night comes, in many parts of\nthe Pampas. But Thalcave was not deceived; he knew with what enemies he\nhad to deal. He loaded his carbine, and took a position near the first\nstakes of the inclosure.\n\nHe did not wait long. A strange cry, a mingling of barks and howls,\nresounded over the plain. The report of the carbine answered it,\nand was followed by a hundred frightful yelps. Glenarvan and Robert\nsuddenly awoke.\n\n[Sidenote: FEARFUL ODDS.]\n\n\"What is the matter?\" asked Robert.\n\n\"Indians?\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\"No,\" replied Thalcave, \"aguaras.\"\n\nRobert looked at Glenarvan.\n\n\"Aguaras?\" said he.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Glenarvan, \"the red wolves of the Pampas.\"\n\nBoth seized their weapons, and joined the Indian. The latter pointed\nto the plain, from which arose a series of formidable howls. Robert\ninvoluntarily took a step backward.\n\n\"You are not afraid of the wolves, my boy?\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\"No, my lord,\" replied Robert, in a firm tone. \"With you I fear\nnothing.\"\n\n\"So much the better. These aguaras are not very formidable beasts; and\nwere it not for their numbers I should not even think of them.\"\n\n\"What does it matter?\" replied Robert. \"We are well armed. Let them\ncome.\"\n\n\"And they shall be well received.\"\n\nSpeaking thus, Glenarvan endeavored to reassure the lad; but he did\nnot think without a secret terror of that dense horde of exasperated\nbeasts. Perhaps there were hundreds of them; and these three, however\nwell armed, could not advantageously contend against so many and such\nantagonists.\n\nBy the howls that resounded over the Pampas, and by the multi"}]}

The\ndanger was increasing every moment. Already the broken stakes were\nyielding to the teeth and claws of the wolves. But neither Glenarvan\nnor Thalcave appeared willing to yield. The Indian had drawn Glenarvan\ntowards the entrance of the inclosure. He pointed to the plain, now\nfree from wolves. In his animated language, he explained that not a\nmoment was to be lost; that the danger, if this plan failed, would be\ngreater for those who remained; in short, that he alone knew Thaouka\nwell enough to employ his marvelous agility and speed for the common\nsafety. Glenarvan blindly persisted in his resolve to sacrifice\nhimself, when suddenly he was pushed violently back. Thaouka pranced,\nreared on his hind legs, and all at once, with a spring, cleared the\nbarrier of fire and the rampart of bodies, while a boyish voice cried,--\n\n\"God save you, my lord!\"\n\nGlenarvan and Thalcave had scarcely time to perceive Robert, who,\nclinging to the horse's mane, disappeared in the darkness.\n\n\"Robert, unfortunate!\" cried Glenarvan.\n\nBut these words the Indian himself could not hear. Frightful howls\nresounded. The wolves, starting on the track of the horse, fled into\nthe darkness with a terrible speed.\n\nThalcave and Glenarvan rushed out of the ramada. Already the plain had\nresumed its tranquillity, and they could scarcely distinguish a moving\nline which undulated afar in the shadows of the night.\n\nGlenarvan sank upon the ground, overcome, in despair, clasping his\nhands. He gazed at Thalcave, who smiled with his accustomed calmness.\n\n\"Thaouka--good horse--brave child--he will be saved!\" he repeated,\nnodding his head.\n\n\"But if he falls?\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\"He will not fall!\"\n\nIn spite of Thalcave's confidence, his companion passed the night in\nterrible anguish. He was no longer even mindful of the danger still to\nbe feared from the wolves. He would have gone in search of Robert, but\nthe Indian restrained him, and explained that their horses could not\novertake the boy, that Thaouka must have distanced his enemies, and\ncould not be found in the darkness. They must wait for day to start in\nsearch of Robert.\n\nAt four o'clock in the morning day began to break. The mists of the\nhorizon were soon tinged with pale rays. A sparkling dew covered the\nplain, and the tall grass began to wave under the first breezes of the\ndawn.\n\nThe moment of departure had arrived.\n\n\"Forward!\" said the Indian.\n\nGlenarvan did not reply, but sprang upon Robert's horse, and the two\nwere soon galloping towards the west in the direction from which their\ncompanions were to come.\n\nFor an hour they traveled thus with great speed, gazing around for\nRobert, and dreading at each step to behold his mangled body. Glenarvan\ntortured the flanks of his horse with his spurs. Suddenly shots were\nheard, and reports at regular intervals, like signals for recognition.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"It is they!\" cried Glenarvan.\n\nThalcave and he urged their horses to a more rapid pace, and a few\nmoments afterwards they joined the party led by Paganel.\n\n[Sidenote: LIVELY GRATITUDE.]\n\nTo Glenarvan's joy, Robert was there, alive, borne by the noble\nThaouka, who neighed with pleasure at seeing his master.\n\n\"Ah, my boy! my boy!\" cried Glenarvan, with unspeakable tenderness; and\nRobert and he, dismounting, rushed into each other's arms.\n\nThen it was the Indian's turn to clasp to his breast the courageous son\nof Captain Grant.\n\n\"He lives! he lives!\" exclaimed Glenarvan.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Robert, \"thanks to Thaouka.\"\n\nThe Indian had not waited for these words of gratitude to embrace his\nhorse, but at that very moment he spoke to him and embraced him, as\nif human blood flowed in the veins of the noble animal. Then, turning\ntowards Paganel, he pointed to young Robert.\n\n\"A brave boy!\" said he.\n\nGlenarvan, however, asked, even while he admired the lad,--\n\n\"Why, my son, did you no"}, {"chunk_id": 140, "text": "ctions, was always ahead, and the first to fire. But\nCaptain Mangles had promised to watch over him, a fact which tended not\na little to allay Miss Grant's apprehension for her brother's safety.\n\nOf all the sports of the day the most interesting was unquestionably\na kangaroo hunt. About four o'clock the dogs started a troop of these\ncurious animals. The little ones took refuge in their mothers' pouches,\nand the whole drove rushed away in single file. Nothing can be more\nastonishing than the enormous bounds of the kangaroo, whose hind legs\nare twice as long as its fore ones, and bend like a spring. At the head\nof the drove was a male five feet high,--\"an old man,\" in the language\nof the bushmen.\n\nFor four or five miles the chase was briskly continued. The kangaroos\ndid not slacken their pace; and the dogs, who feared, with good reason,\nthe powerful blows of their formidable paws, did not venture to\napproach them. But at last the drove stopped in exhaustion, and \"the\nold man\" braced himself against the trunk of a tree, ready to fight\nfor his life. One of the pointers, carried on by the impetus of his\ncourse, rolled within reach of him. A moment after, the unfortunate\ndog was tossed into the air, and fell back lifeless. The entire pack,\ndeterred by the fate of their comrade, kept at a respectful distance.\nIt became necessary to dispatch the kangaroo with the rifle, and\nnothing but bullets could bring down the gigantic quadruped.\n\nAt this juncture Robert narrowly escaped being the victim of his\nrashness. In order to make sure of his aim, he approached so near the\nkangaroo that the animal made a spring at him. Robert fell. A cry of\nalarm resounded. Mary Grant, speechless with apprehension, stretched\nher hands towards her brother. No one dared to fire, for fear of\nhitting the boy.\n\nSuddenly Captain Mangles, with his hunting-knife open, rushed upon the\nkangaroo, at the risk of his life, and stabbed it to the heart. The\nbeast fell dead, and Robert rose unharmed. An instant after, he was in\nthe arms of his sister.\n\n\"Thanks, Captain Mangles! thanks!\" said Mary, extending her hand to the\nyoung captain.\n\n\"I promised to take care of him,\" replied the captain, as he took the\ntrembling hand of the young girl.\n\nThis adventure ended the hunt. The troop of kangaroos had scattered\nafter the death of their leader, whose carcass was brought to the house.\n\nIt was now six o'clock, and dinner was in readiness for the hunters;\ncomprising, among other dishes, a soup of kangaroo's tail, prepared in\nthe native style.\n\nAfter a dessert of ices and sherbet, the party repaired to the parlor,\nwhere the evening was devoted to music. Lady Helena, who was a good\npianiste, presided at the instrument, while Michael and Alexander\nPatterson sang with great taste selections from the latest compositions\nof the modern musical masters.\n\n[Sidenote: A FRESH DEPARTURE.]\n\nAt eleven o'clock tea was served in true English style. Paganel\nhaving desired to taste the Australian tea, a liquid, black as ink,\nwas brought to him. It consisted of a quart of water, in which half\na pound of tea had been boiled four hours. Paganel, with a wry face,\npronounced it excellent. At midnight the guests were conducted to cool\nand comfortable chambers, where they renewed in dreams the pleasures of\nthe day.\n\nThe next morning, at sunrise, they took leave of the two young\nsettlers, with many thanks, and with warmly-expressed hopes to see them\nat Malcolm Castle at no very distant day. The cart then started, and in\na few minutes, as the road wound around the foot of Mount Hottam, the\nhospitable habitation disappeared, like a passing vision, from the eyes\nof the travelers. For five miles farther they traversed the grounds\nof the station, and not till nine o'clock did the little party pass\nthe last palisade and enter upon the almost unknown districts of the\ncountry before them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\n\nSUSPICIOUS OCCURRENCES.\n\n\nA mighty barrier crossed the road on the southeast. It was the chain\nof the Aust"}, {"chunk_id": 183, "text": "y as most of\nPaganel's disquisitions and information concerning these islands, and\nthey were before a late hour exchanged for peaceful though probably\ndreamy slumbers, by his hearers.\n\nEarly the next morning the signal for departure was given. The rain had\nceased during the night, and the sky was covered with grayish clouds,\nwhich intercepted the rays of the sun, so that the temperature thus\nmoderated enabled them to endure the fatigues of the journey.\n\nBy consulting the map, Paganel had calculated that they would have to\ntravel eight days. But, instead of following the windings of the coast,\nhe considered it best to proceed to the village of Ngarnavahia, at the\njunction of the Waikato and Waipa rivers. Here the overland mail-road\npassed, and it would thence be easy to reach Drury, and rest, after\ntheir hardships, in a comfortable hotel.\n\nBut before they left the shore their attention was drawn to the large\nnumber of seals, of a peculiar appearance and genus, which lay on the\nbroad sands daily washed by the tidal water. These seals, with their\nrounded heads, their upturned look, their expressive eyes, presented an\nappearance, almost a physiognomy, that was mild and wellnigh tender,\nand served to recall to the traveler's memory the tales about the\nsirens of the olden and modern times, who served as the enchantresses\nto just such inhospitable shores as that seemed on which they had\nthemselves been cast. These animals, which are very numerous on the\ncoast of New Zealand, are hunted and killed for the sake of their\noil and their skins, and Paganel was of course able to tell how much\nwithin the last few years they had been searched for by the traders and\nnavigators on these seas.\n\n[Illustration: These seals, with rounded heads, upturned look,\nexpressive eyes, presented an appearance, almost a physiognomy, that\nwas mild and wellnigh tender.]\n\n[Illustration: The New Zealand \"kiwi,\" known to naturalists as the\napteryx.]\n\nWhilst speaking of these matters, Robert drew Paganel's attention to\nsome curious amphibious creatures, resembling the seals, but larger,\nwhich were devouring with rapidity the large stones lying on the shore.\n\n\"Look,\" said he, \"here are seals which feed on pebbles.\"\n\nPaganel assured them that these sea-elephants were only weighting\nthemselves preparatory to their descent into the water, and protested\nthat if they would but wait for a time they might see them descend and\nsubsequently return when they had unloaded themselves. The first part\nof this programme they saw accomplished; but, greatly to Paganel's\ngrief, Glenarvan would not longer delay the party, and they soon began\nto see inland beauties and curiosities of another sort.\n\nThe district through which they had to walk this day and the next was\none very thick with brush and under-wood, and there was no possibility\nof horse or vehicle passing or meeting them. They now regretted the\nabsence of their Australian cart, for the height and frequency of\nthe large ferns in the neighborhood prevented their making any rapid\nprogress on foot.\n\n[Sidenote: THE LAST STAGE OF PERIPATETICS.]\n\nHere and there, however, Robert and Paganel would rejoice together\nover some choice bush or bird that they had met with. Notable among\nthe latter was the New Zealand \"kiwi,\" known to naturalists as the\napteryx, and which is becoming very scarce, from the pursuit of its\nmany enemies. Robert discovered in a nest on the ground a couple of\nthese birds without tails or wings, but with four toes on the foot, and\na long beak or bill like that of a woodcock, and small white feathers\nall over its body. Of this bird there was then an entire absence in the\nzoological collections of Europe, and Paganel indulged the hope that he\nmight be able to be the proud contributor of such a valuable specimen\nto the \"Jardin\" of his own city. For the present, at least, the\nrealization of his hopes had to be deferred; and at length, after some\ndays of weariness and continued travel, the party reached the banks\nof the "}, {"chunk_id": 47, "text": "ough his mind.\n\n\"If Robert is still living!\" exclaimed he, with a cry of terror, \"this\nbird! Fire, my friends, fire!\"\n\nBut he was too late. The condor had disappeared behind the lofty\nboulders. A second passed that seemed an eternity. Then the enormous\nbird reappeared, heavily laden, and rising slowly.\n\nA cry of horror was uttered. In the claws of the condor an inanimate\nbody was seen suspended and dangling. It was Robert Grant. The bird had\nraised him by his garments, and was now hovering in mid-air at least\none hundred and fifty feet above the encampment. He had perceived the\ntravelers, and was violently striving to escape with his heavy prey.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"May Robert's body be dashed upon these rocks,\" cried Glenarvan,\n\"rather than serve----\"\n\nHe did not finish, but, seizing Wilson's rifle, attempted to take aim\nat the condor. But his arm trembled; he could not sight the piece. His\neyes were dimmed.\n\n\"Let me try,\" said the major.\n\nWith clear eye, steady hand, and motionless body, he aimed at the bird,\nthat was already three hundred feet above him. But he had not pressed\nthe trigger, when a report resounded in the valley. A light smoke\ncurled up between two rocks, and the condor, shot in the head, fell,\nslowly turning, sustained by his broad outspread wings. He had not\nreleased his prey, and at last reached the ground, ten paces from the\nbanks of the stream.\n\n\"Quick! quick!\" said Glenarvan; and without seeking whence this\nprovidential shot had come, he rushed towards the condor. His\ncompanions closely followed him.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Sidenote: \"THE LOST IS FOUND.\"]\n\nWhen they arrived the bird was dead, and the body of Robert was hidden\nunder its great wings. Glenarvan threw himself upon the child, released\nhim from the talons of the condor, stretched him on the grass, and\npressed his ear to his breast.\n\nNever did a wilder cry of joy issue from human lips than when Glenarvan\nrose, exclaiming:\n\n\"He lives! he lives!\"\n\nIn an instant Robert was stripped of his garments, and his face bathed\nwith fresh water. He made a movement, opened his eyes, looked around,\nand uttered a few words:\n\n\"You, my lord--my father!----\"\n\nGlenarvan could not speak. Emotion stifled him, and, kneeling, he wept\nbeside this child so miraculously saved.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\nTHALCAVE.\n\n\nAfter the great danger that he had just escaped, Robert incurred\nanother, no less great,--that of being overwhelmed with caresses.\nHowever feeble he was still, not one of these good people could refrain\nfrom pressing him to his heart. But it must be confessed that these\nwell-meant embraces are not fatal, for the boy did not die.\n\nWhen his rescue was certain, thought reverted to his rescuer, and the\nmajor very naturally thought of looking around him. Fifty paces from\nthe stream, a man of lofty stature was standing, motionless, on one\nof the first ledges of the mountain. A long gun lay at his feet. This\nindividual, who had so suddenly appeared, had broad shoulders, and\nlong hair tied with leathern thongs. His height exceeded six feet, and\nhis bronzed face was red between his eyes and mouth, black below his\neyelids, and white on his forehead. After the manner of the Patagonians\nof the frontiers, the native wore a splendid cloak, decorated with\nred arabesques, made of the skin of a guanaco, its silky fur turned\noutward, and sewed with ostrich-tendons. Under his cloak a tippet of\nfox-skin encircled his neck and terminated in a point in front. At his\ngirdle hung a little bag containing the colors with which he painted\nhis face. His leggings were of ox-hide, and fastened to the ankle with\nstraps regularly crossed.\n\nThe figure of this Patagonian was fine, and his face denoted real\nintelligence in spite of the colors that adorned (!) it. He waited in\nan attitude full of dignity, and, seeing him so motionless and stern on\nhis pedestal of rocks, you would have taken him for a statue.\n\nThe major, as soon as he perceived him, pointed him out to Glenarvan,\nwho hastened towards him. The Patag"}, {"chunk_id": 51, "text": " Paganel, he did not leave the Indian. He became Thalcave's\nshadow, and could not remain quiet in the presence of a real\nPatagonian, in comparison with whom he would have passed for a dwarf.\nHe overwhelmed the grave Indian with Spanish phrases, to which the\nlatter quietly listened. The geographer studied this time without a\nbook, and was often heard repeating words aloud.\n\n\"If I do not get the accent,\" said he to the major, \"you must not be\nangry with me. Who would have thought that one day a Patagonian would\nteach me Spanish!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\nNEWS OF THE LOST CAPTAIN.\n\n\nAt eight o'clock the next morning Thalcave gave the signal for\ndeparture. The slope was gradual, and the travelers had only to descend\na gentle declivity to the sea.\n\nWhen the Patagonian declined the horse that Glenarvan offered him, the\nlatter thought that he preferred to go on foot, according to the custom\nof certain guides; and indeed, his long legs ought to have made walking\neasy. But he was mistaken.\n\nAt the moment of departure Thalcave whistled in a peculiar manner.\nImmediately a magnificent Argentine horse, of superb form, issued from\na small wood near by, and approached at the call of his master. The\nanimal was perfectly beautiful. His brown color indicated a sound,\nspirited and courageous beast. He had a small and elegantly poised\nhead, widely opening nostrils, a fiery eye, large hams, swelling\nwithers, broad breast, long pasterns, in short, all the qualities that\nconstitute strength and suppleness. The major, like a perfect horseman,\nadmired unreservedly this specimen of the horses of the plains. This\nbeautiful creature was called Thaouka, which means \"bird\" in the\nPatagonian language, and he justly merited this appellation.\n\n[Sidenote: A FRESH START.]\n\nWhen Thalcave was in the saddle, the horse pranced with spirited grace,\nand the Patagonian, a skillful rider, was magnificent to behold. His\noutfit comprised two weapons of the chase, the \"bolas\" and the lasso.\nThe bolas consists of three balls tied together by a leathern string,\nwhich are fastened to the front of the saddle. The Indians frequently\nthrow them the distance of a hundred paces at the animal or enemy that\nthey are pursuing, and with such precision that they twist about their\nlegs and bring them to the ground. It is, therefore, in their hands a\nformidable instrument, and they handle it with surprising dexterity.\nThe lasso, on the contrary, does not leave the hand that wields it. It\nconsists simply of a leathern thong thirty feet in length, terminating\nin a slip-noose which works upon an iron ring. The right hand throws\nthe slip-noose, while the left hand holds the remainder of the lasso,\nthe end of which is firmly tied to the saddle. A long carbine in a\nsling completed the Patagonian's armament.\n\nThalcave, without observing the admiration caused by his natural\ngrace, ease and courage, took the lead, and the party advanced, now\nat a gallop, and now at a walk, for their horses seemed entirely\nunaccustomed to trotting. Robert mounted with much boldness, and\nspeedily convinced Glenarvan of his ability to keep his seat.\n\nOn issuing from the gorges of the Andes, they encountered a great\nnumber of sand-ridges, called \"medanos,\" real waves incessantly\nagitated by the wind, when the roots of the herbage did not confine\nthem to the earth. This sand is of an extreme fineness; and, at the\nleast breath, they saw it float away in light clouds, or form regular\nsand-columns which rose to a considerable height. This spectacle caused\npleasure as well as annoyance to the eyes. Pleasure, for nothing was\nmore curious than these columns, wandering over the plain, struggling,\nmingling, sinking and rising in inexpressible confusion; and annoyance,\nsince an impalpable dust emanated from these innumerable medanos and\npenetrated the eyelids, however tightly they were closed.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThis phenomenon continued during a great part of the day.

The\ndanger was increasing every moment. Already the broken stakes were\nyielding to the teeth and claws of the wolves. But neither Glenarvan\nnor Thalcave appeared willing to yield. The Indian had drawn Glenarvan\ntowards the entrance of the inclosure. He pointed to the plain, now\nfree from wolves. In his animated language, he explained that not a\nmoment was to be lost; that the danger, if this plan failed, would be\ngreater for those who remained; in short, that he alone knew Thaouka\nwell enough to employ his marvelous agility and speed for the common\nsafety. Glenarvan blindly persisted in his resolve to sacrifice\nhimself, when suddenly he was pushed violently back. Thaouka pranced,\nreared on his hind legs, and all at once, with a spring, cleared the\nbarrier of fire and the rampart of bodies, while a boyish voice cried,--\n\n\"God save you, my lord!\"\n\nGlenarvan and Thalcave had scarcely time to perceive Robert, who,\nclinging to the horse's mane, disappeared in the darkness.\n\n\"Robert, unfortunate!\" cried Glenarvan.\n\nBut these words the Indian himself could not hear. Frightful howls\nresounded. The wolves, starting on the track of the horse, fled into\nthe darkness with a terrible speed.\n\nThalcave and Glenarvan rushed out of the ramada. Already the plain had\nresumed its tranquillity, and they could scarcely distinguish a moving\nline which undulated afar in the shadows of the night.\n\nGlenarvan sank upon the ground, overcome, in despair, clasping his\nhands. He gazed at Thalcave, who smiled with his accustomed calmness.\n\n\"Thaouka--good horse--brave child--he will be saved!\" he repeated,\nnodding his head.\n\n\"But if he falls?\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\"He will not fall!\"\n\nIn spite of Thalcave's confidence, his companion passed the night in\nterrible anguish. He was no longer even mindful of the danger still to\nbe feared from the wolves. He would have gone in search of Robert, but\nthe Indian restrained him, and explained that their horses could not\novertake the boy, that Thaouka must have distanced his enemies, and\ncould not be found in the darkness. They must wait for day to start in\nsearch of Robert.\n\nAt four o'clock in the morning day began to break. The mists of the\nhorizon were soon tinged with pale rays. A sparkling dew covered the\nplain, and the tall grass began to wave under the first breezes of the\ndawn.\n\nThe moment of departure had arrived.\n\n\"Forward!\" said the Indian.\n\nGlenarvan did not reply, but sprang upon Robert's horse, and the two\nwere soon galloping towards the west in the direction from which their\ncompanions were to come.\n\nFor an hour they traveled thus with great speed, gazing around for\nRobert, and dreading at each step to behold his mangled body. Glenarvan\ntortured the flanks of his horse with his spurs. Suddenly shots were\nheard, and reports at regular intervals, like signals for recognition.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"It is they!\" cried Glenarvan.\n\nThalcave and he urged their horses to a more rapid pace, and a few\nmoments afterwards they joined the party led by Paganel.\n\n[Sidenote: LIVELY GRATITUDE.]\n\nTo Glenarvan's joy, Robert was there, alive, borne by the noble\nThaouka, who neighed with pleasure at seeing his master.\n\n\"Ah, my boy! my boy!\" cried Glenarvan, with unspeakable tenderness; and\nRobert and he, dismounting, rushed into each other's arms.\n\nThen it was the Indian's turn to clasp to his breast the courageous son\nof Captain Grant.\n\n\"He lives! he lives!\" exclaimed Glenarvan.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Robert, \"thanks to Thaouka.\"\n\nThe Indian had not waited for these words of gratitude to embrace his\nhorse, but at that very moment he spoke to him and embraced him, as\nif human blood flowed in the veins of the noble animal. Then, turning\ntowards Paganel, he pointed to young Robert.\n\n\"A brave boy!\" said he.\n\nGlenarvan, however, asked, even while he admired the lad,--\n\n\"Why, my son, did you no"}, {"chunk_id": 78, "text": "tives\nwith a terrible roar. Men and beasts, everything, disappeared in a\nwhirlpool of foam. A ponderous liquid mass engulfed them in its furious\ntide. When the deluge had passed, the men regained the surface, and\nrapidly counted their numbers; but the horses, except Thaouka, had\ndisappeared forever.\n\n\"Courage! courage!\" cried Glenarvan, who supported Paganel with one arm\nand swam with the other.\n\n\"All right! all right!\" replied the worthy geographer; \"indeed I am not\nsorry----\"\n\nWhat was he not sorry for? No one ever knew; for the poor man was\nforced to swallow the end of his sentence in half a pint of muddy water.\n\nThe major calmly advanced, taking a regular stroke of which the most\nskillful swimmer would not have been ashamed. The sailors worked their\nway along like porpoises in their native element. As for Robert, he\nclung to Thaouka's mane, and was thus drawn along. The horse proudly\ncut the waters, and kept himself instinctively on a line with the tree,\ntowards which the current bore him, and which was now not far distant.\n\nIn a few moments the entire party reached it. It was fortunate; for, if\nthis refuge had failed, all chance of safety would have vanished, and\nthey must have perished in the waves. The water was up to the top of\nthe trunk where the main branches grew, so that it was easy to grasp\nthem.\n\nThalcave, leaving his horse, and lifting Robert, seized the first limb,\nand soon his powerful arms had lodged the exhausted swimmers in a place\nof safety. But Thaouka, carried away by the current, was rapidly\ndisappearing. He turned his intelligent head towards his master, and,\nshaking his long mane, neighed for him beseechingly.\n\n[Illustration: A huge wave, forty feet high, overwhelmed the fugitives\nwith a terrible roar. Men and beasts, everything, disappeared in a\nwhirlpool of foam. A ponderous liquid mass engulfed them in its furious\ntide.]\n\n\"Do you abandon him?\" said Paganel.\n\n\"I?\" cried the Indian, and, plunging into the tempestuous waters, he\nreappeared some distance from the tree. A few moments after, his arm\nrested upon the neck of Thaouka, and horse and horseman swam away\ntogether towards the misty horizon of the north.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII.\n\nA SINGULAR ABODE.\n\n\nThe tree upon which Glenarvan and his companions had just found refuge\nresembled a walnut-tree. It had the same shining foliage and rounded\nform. It was the \"ombu,\" which is met with only on the Argentine\nPlains. It had an enormous, twisted trunk, and was confined to the\nearth not only by its great roots, but also by strong shoots which held\nit most tenaciously. It had thus resisted the force of the inundation.\n\n[Sidenote: AN ORNITHOLOGICAL OMNIUM-GATHERUM.]\n\nThis ombu measured one hundred feet in height, and might have covered\nwith its shade a circumference of three hundred and sixty feet. All\nthe upper part rested on three great branches, which forked from the\ntop of the trunk, that was six feet in diameter. Two of these branches\nwere nearly perpendicular, and supported the immense canopy of foliage,\nwhose crossed, twisted, and interlaced limbs, as if woven by the hand\nof a basket-maker, formed an impenetrable shelter. The third branch,\non the contrary, extended almost horizontally over the roaring waters;\nits leaves were bathed in them, while it seemed a promontory to this\nisland of verdure surrounded by an ocean. There was abundant space,\nalso, in the interior of this gigantic tree. The foliage, which was\nnot very dense at its outer circumference, left large openings like\nsky-lights, and made it well ventilated and cool. At sight of these\nbranches rising in innumerable ramifications towards the clouds, while\nthe parasitic convolvuli bound them to each other, and the rays of the\nsun shone through the interstices of the leaves, you would really have\nthought that the trunk of this ombu bore upon itself alone an entire\nforest.\n\nOn the arrival of the fugitives, a feathered population flew away to\nthe top branches, protesting by their cries against so flagran"}, {"chunk_id": 54, "text": "nd, wishing to save\nhis reputation, had begun with renewed energy his geographical\ndemonstrations, when the Patagonian stopped him with a gesture.\n\n\"You are searching for a prisoner?\" he said.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Paganel.\n\n\"And exactly on the line from the setting to the rising sun?\" said\nThalcave, indicating by a comparison, in the Indian manner, the course\nfrom west to east.\n\n\"Yes, yes, that is it!\"\n\n\"And it is your God,\" said the Patagonian, \"who has confided to the\nwaves of the vast ocean the secrets of the prisoner?\"\n\n\"God himself.\"\n\n\"May his will be accomplished then!\" replied Thalcave, with a certain\nsolemnity. \"We will go to the east, and, if necessary, even to the sun.\"\n\nPaganel, in his exultation over his pupil, immediately translated to\nhis companions the replies of the Indian.\n\nGlenarvan requested Paganel to ask the Patagonian if he had heard\nof any strangers falling into the hands of the Indians, which was\naccordingly done.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" replied the Patagonian.\n\nAs soon as this word was translated, Thalcave was surrounded by the\nseven travelers, who gazed at him with questioning looks. Paganel,\nexcited and scarcely finding his words, resumed these interesting\ninterrogatories, while his eyes, fixed upon the grave Indian, strove\nto anticipate his reply before it issued from his lips. Every word the\nPatagonian said he repeated in English, so that his companions heard\nthe Indian speak, as it were, in their own language.\n\n\"And this prisoner?\" inquired Paganel.\n\n\"He was a stranger,\" replied Thalcave slowly; \"a European.\"\n\n\"You have seen him?\"\n\n\"No, but he is mentioned in the accounts of the Indians. He was a brave\nman.\"\n\n\"You understand, my friends,\" said Paganel; \"a courageous man!\"\n\n\"My father!\" cried Robert Grant.\n\nThen, addressing Paganel:\n\n\"How do you say 'It is my father,' in Spanish?\" he asked.\n\n\"_Es mio padre_,\" answered the geographer.\n\nImmediately Robert, taking Thalcave's hands, said in a sweet voice,--\n\n\"_Es mio padre!_\"\n\n\"_Suo padre!_\" replied the Patagonian, whose look brightened.\n\nHe took the boy in his arms, lifted him from his horse, and gazed at\nhim with the most curious sympathy. His intelligent countenance became\nsuffused with a peaceful emotion.\n\nBut Paganel had not finished his inquiries. Where was this prisoner?\nWhat was he doing? When had Thalcave heard of him? All these questions\nthronged his mind at once. He did not have to wait long for answers,\nbut learnt that the European was a slave of one of the Indian tribes\nthat scour the plains.\n\n\"But where was he last?\" asked Paganel.\n\n\"With the cazique Calfoucoura,\" answered Thalcave.\n\n\"On the line we have been following?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And who is this cazique?\"\n\n\"The chief of the Poyuches Indians; a man with two tongues and two\nhearts.\"\n\n[Sidenote: A SCIENTIFIC BATH.]\n\n\"That is to say, false in word and in deed,\" said Paganel, after\ntranslating to his companions this beautiful metaphor of the Indian\nlanguage. \"And can we rescue our friend?\" he added.\n\n\"Perhaps so, if your friend is still in the hands of the Indians.\"\n\n\"And when did you hear of him?\"\n\n\"A long time ago, and, since then, the sun has brought back two summers\nto the sky.\"\n\nGlenarvan's joy could not be described. This answer coincided exactly\nwith the date of the document. But one question remained to be asked.\n\n\"You speak of a prisoner,\" said Paganel; \"but were there not three?\"\n\n\"I do not know,\" replied Thalcave.\n\n\"And you know nothing of their actual situation?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\nThis last word ended the conversation. It was possible that the three\nprisoners had been separated a long time. But the substance of the\nPatagonian's information was that the Indians spoke of a European who\nhad fallen into their power. The date of his captivity, the place where\nhe must have been, everything, even to the Patagonian phrase used to\nexpress his courage, related evidently to Captain Harry Grant.\n\nTheir progress was now somewhat slow and difficult; their next object\nbeing to reach and cross the river Colorado, to w"}, {"chunk_id": 197, "text": "emselves upon a mat. Sleep, which soothes all\nwoes, soon closed their eyes, and they slumbered in each other's arms,\novercome by fatigue and long wakefulness.\n\nGlenarvan, taking his friends aside, said:\n\n\"My dear companions, our lives and those of these poor ladies are in\nGod's hands. If Heaven has decreed that we shall die to-morrow, we can,\nI am sure, die like brave people, like Christians, ready to appear\nfearlessly before the final Judge. God, who does read the secrets of\nthe soul, knows that we are fulfilling a noble mission. If death awaits\nus instead of success, it is his will. However severe his decree may\nbe, I shall not murmur against it. But this is not death alone; it is\ntorture, disgrace; and here are two women----\"\n\nGlenarvan's voice, hitherto firm, now faltered. He paused to control\nhis emotion. After a moment's silence, he said to the young captain:\n\n\"John, you have promised Mary Grant what I have promised Lady Helena.\nWhat have you resolved?\"\n\n\"This promise,\" replied John Mangles, \"I believe I have the right in\nthe sight of God to fulfill.\"\n\n\"Yes, John; but we have no weapons.\"\n\n\"Here is one,\" answered John, displaying a poniard. \"I snatched it from\nKara-Tété's hands when he fell at your feet. My lord, he of us who\nsurvives the other shall fulfill this vow.\"\n\nAt these words a profound silence reigned in the hut. At last the major\ninterrupted it by saying:\n\n\"My friends, reserve this extreme measure till the last moment. I am no\nadvocate of what is irremediable.\"\n\n\"I do not speak for ourselves,\" replied Glenarvan. \"We can brave\ndeath, whatever it may be. Ah, if we were alone! Twenty times already\nwould I have urged you to make a sally and attack those wretches. But\n_they_----\"\n\n[Sidenote: THE APPROACH OF DAY.]\n\nAt this moment Captain Mangles raised the mat and counted twenty-five\nnatives, who were watching at the door of their prison. A great fire\nhad been kindled, which cast a dismal light over the irregular outlines\nof the pah. Some of these savages were stretched around the fire; and\nothers, standing and motionless, were darkly defined against the bright\ncurtain of flame.\n\nIt is said that, between the jailer who watches and the prisoner who\nwishes to escape, the chances are on the side of the latter. Indeed,\nthe design of one is stronger than that of the other, for the first\nmay forget that he is guarding, but the second cannot forget that he\nis guarded; the captive thinks oftener of escaping than his guardian\nthinks of preventing his escape. But here it was hate and vengeance\nthat watched the prisoners, and not an indifferent jailer. They had not\nbeen bound, for bonds were useless where twenty-five men guarded the\nonly outlet of the prison.\n\nThis hut was built against the rock that terminated the fortification,\nand was only accessible by a narrow passage that connected it with the\nfront of the pah. The other two sides of the building were flanked\nby towering precipices, and stood on the verge of an abyss a hundred\nfeet deep. A descent this way was therefore impossible. There was no\nchance of escaping in the rear, which was guarded by the enormous rock.\nThe only exit was the door of the temple, and the Maoris defended the\nnarrow passage that connected it with the pah. All escape was therefore\nout of the question; and Glenarvan, after examining the walls of his\nprison, was forced to acknowledge this disheartening fact.\n\nMeantime, the hours of this night of anguish were passing away. Dense\ndarkness had covered the mountain. Neither moon nor stars illumined\nthe deep shades. A few gusts of wind swept along the side of the\npah. The stakes of the hut groaned, the fire of the natives suddenly\nrevived at this passing draught, and the flames cast rapid flashes\ninto the temple, illumining for a moment the group of prisoners. These\npoor people were absorbed with their last thoughts; a deathly silence\nreigned in the hut.\n\nIt must have been about four o'clock in the morning, when the major's\nattention was attracted by a s"}, {"chunk_id": 208, "text": "and if it shall itself devour its profaners the\ntaboo will be still more rigorous.\"\n\n\"This plan is really well conceived,\" remarked Glenarvan. \"There is\nonly one chance against it, and that is, that the savages may persist\nin remaining at the foot of the mountain till the provisions fail\nus. But this is scarcely probable, especially if we play our part\nskillfully.\"\n\n\"And when shall we make this last venture?\" asked Lady Helena.\n\n\"This very evening,\" answered Paganel, \"at the hour of the greatest\ndarkness.\"\n\n\"Agreed,\" said MacNabb. \"Paganel, you are a man of genius; and although\nfrom habit I am scarcely ever enthusiastic, I will answer for your\nsuccess. Ha! these rascals! we shall perform a little miracle for them\nthat will delay their conversion a good century. May the missionaries\npardon us!\"\n\nPaganel's plan was therefore adopted, and really, with the\nsuperstitious notions of the Maoris, it might and ought to succeed.\nIt only remained to execute it. The idea was good, but in practice\ndifficult. Might not this volcano consume the audacious ones who should\ndig the crater? Could they control and direct this eruption when the\nvapors, flames, and lava should be let loose? Would it not engulf\nthe entire peak in a flood of fire? They were tampering with those\nphenomena whose absolute control is reserved for forces higher than\ntheirs.\n\nPaganel had foreseen these difficulties, but he expected to act\nprudently, and not to venture to extremes. An illusion was enough to\ndeceive the Maoris, without the awful reality of a large eruption.\n\nHow long that day seemed! Each one counted the interminable hours.\nEverything was prepared for flight. The provisions of the tomb had\nbeen divided, and made into convenient bundles. Several mats, and the\nfire-arms, which had been found in the tomb of the chief, formed light\nbaggage. Of course these preparations were made within the palisaded\ninclosure and unknown to the savages.\n\nAt six o'clock the steward served a farewell feast. Where and when they\nshould eat in the valleys no one could foretell.\n\nTwilight came on. The sun disappeared behind a bank of dense clouds of\nthreatening aspect. A few flashes illumined the horizon, and a distant\npeal of thunder rumbled along the vault of the sky. Paganel welcomed\nthe storm that came to the aid of his design.\n\nAt eight o'clock the summit of the mountain was hidden by a foreboding\ndarkness, while the sky looked terribly black, as if for a background\nto the flaming outbreak that Paganel was about to inaugurate. The\nMaoris could no longer see their prisoners. The time for action had\ncome. Rapidity was necessary, and Glenarvan, Paganel, MacNabb, Robert,\nthe steward, and the two sailors at once set to work vigorously.\n\nThe place for the crater was chosen thirty paces from Kara-Tété's tomb.\nIt was important that this structure should be spared by the eruption,\nfor otherwise the taboo would become ineffective. Paganel had observed\nan enormous block of stone, around which the vapors seemed to pour\nforth with considerable force. This rocky mass covered a small natural\ncrater in the peak, and only by its weight prevented the escape of the\nsubterranean flames. If they could succeed in overturning it, the smoke\nand lava would immediately issue through the unobstructed opening.\n\n[Sidenote: VULCANS AT WORK.]\n\nThe fugitives made themselves levers out of the stakes of the tomb, and\nwith these they vigorously attacked the ponderous mass. Under their\nunited efforts the rock was not long in moving. They dug a sort of\ngroove for it down the side of the mountain, that it might slide on an\ninclined plane.\n\nAs their action increased, the trembling of the earth became more\nviolent. Hollow rumblings and hissings sounded under the thin\ncrust. But the bold experimenters, like real Vulcans, governing the\nunderground fires, worked on in silence. Several cracks and a few gusts\nof hot smoke warned them that their position was becoming dangerous.\nBut a final effort detached the block, which gli"}]}

They were thus perpetually\nemployed,—Faria, that he might not see himself grow old; Dantès, for\nfear of recalling the almost extinct past which now only floated in his\nmemory like a distant light wandering in the night. So life went on for\nthem as it does for those who are not victims of misfortune and whose\nactivities glide along mechanically and tranquilly beneath the eye of\nProvidence.\n\nBut beneath this superficial calm there were in the heart of the young\nman, and perhaps in that of the old man, many repressed desires, many\nstifled sighs, which found vent when Faria was left alone, and when\nEdmond returned to his cell.\n\nOne night Edmond awoke suddenly, believing that he heard someone\ncalling him. He opened his eyes upon utter darkness. His name, or\nrather a plaintive voice which essayed to pronounce his name, reached\nhim. He sat up in bed and a cold sweat broke out upon his brow.\nUndoubtedly the call came from Faria’s dungeon.\n\n“Alas,” murmured Edmond; “can it be?”\n\nHe moved his bed, drew up the stone, rushed into the passage, and\nreached the opposite extremity; the secret entrance was open. By the\nlight of the wretched and wavering lamp, of which we have spoken,\nDantès saw the old man, pale, but yet erect, clinging to the bedstead.\nHis features were writhing with those horrible symptoms which he\nalready knew, and which had so seriously alarmed him when he saw them\nfor the first time.\n\n“Alas, my dear friend,” said Faria in a resigned tone, “you understand,\ndo you not, and I need not attempt to explain to you?”\n\nEdmond uttered a cry of agony, and, quite out of his senses, rushed\ntowards the door, exclaiming, “Help, help!”\n\nFaria had just sufficient strength to restrain him.\n\n“Silence,” he said, “or you are lost. We must now only think of you, my\ndear friend, and so act as to render your captivity supportable or your\nflight possible. It would require years to do again what I have done\nhere, and the results would be instantly destroyed if our jailers knew\nwe had communicated with each other. Besides, be assured, my dear\nEdmond, the dungeon I am about to leave will not long remain empty;\nsome other unfortunate being will soon take my place, and to him you\nwill appear like an angel of salvation. Perhaps he will be young,\nstrong, and enduring, like yourself, and will aid you in your escape,\nwhile I have been but a hindrance. You will no longer have half a dead\nbody tied to you as a drag to all your movements. At length Providence\nhas done something for you; he restores to you more than he takes away,\nand it was time I should die.”\n\nEdmond could only clasp his hands and exclaim, “Oh, my friend, my\nfriend, speak not thus!” and then resuming all his presence of mind,\nwhich had for a moment staggered under this blow, and his strength,\nwhich had failed at the words of the old man, he said, “Oh, I have\nsaved you once, and I will save you a second time!” And raising the\nfoot of the bed, he drew out the phial, still a third filled with the\nred liquor.\n\n“See,” he exclaimed, “there remains still some of the magic draught.\nQuick, quick! tell me what I must do this time; are there any fresh\ninstructions? Speak, my friend; I listen.”\n\n“There is not a hope,” replied Faria, shaking his head, “but no matter;\nGod wills it that man whom he has created, and in whose heart he has so\nprofoundly rooted the love of life, should do all in his power to\npreserve that existence, which, however painful it may be, is yet\nalways so dear.”\n\n“Oh, yes, yes!” exclaimed Dantès; “and I tell you that I will save you\nyet.”\n\n“Well, then, try. The cold gains upon me. I feel the blood flowing\ntowards my brain.

He was accompanied by two of the yacht’s crew.\n\nFranz drew his handkerchief from his pocket, and presented it to the\nman who had spoken to him. Without uttering a word, they bandaged his\neyes with a care that showed their apprehensions of his committing some\nindiscretion. Afterwards he was made to promise that he would not make\nthe least attempt to raise the bandage. He promised.\n\nThen his two guides took his arms, and he went on, guided by them, and\npreceded by the sentinel. After going about thirty paces, he smelt the\nappetizing odor of the kid that was roasting, and knew thus that he was\npassing the bivouac; they then led him on about fifty paces farther,\nevidently advancing towards that part of the shore where they would not\nallow Gaetano to go—a refusal he could now comprehend.\n\nPresently, by a change in the atmosphere, he knew that they were\nentering a cave; after going on for a few seconds more he heard a\ncrackling, and it seemed to him as though the atmosphere again changed,\nand became balmy and perfumed. At length his feet touched on a thick\nand soft carpet, and his guides let go their hold of him. There was a\nmoment’s silence, and then a voice, in excellent French, although, with\na foreign accent, said:\n\n“Welcome, sir. I beg you will remove your bandage.”\n\nIt may be supposed, then, Franz did not wait for a repetition of this\npermission, but took off the handkerchief, and found himself in the\npresence of a man from thirty-eight to forty years of age, dressed in a\nTunisian costume, that is to say, a red cap with a long blue silk\ntassel, a vest of black cloth embroidered with gold, pantaloons of deep\nred, large and full gaiters of the same color, embroidered with gold\nlike the vest, and yellow slippers; he had a splendid cashmere round\nhis waist, and a small sharp and crooked cangiar was passed through his\ngirdle.\n\nAlthough of a paleness that was almost livid, this man had a remarkably\nhandsome face; his eyes were penetrating and sparkling; his nose, quite\nstraight, and projecting direct from the brow, was of the pure Greek\ntype, while his teeth, as white as pearls, were set off to admiration\nby the black moustache that encircled them.\n\nHis pallor was so peculiar, that it seemed to pertain to one who had\nbeen long entombed, and who was incapable of resuming the healthy glow\nand hue of life. He was not particularly tall, but extremely well made,\nand, like the men of the South, had small hands and feet. But what\nastonished Franz, who had treated Gaetano’s description as a fable, was\nthe splendor of the apartment in which he found himself.\n\nThe entire chamber was lined with crimson brocade, worked with flowers\nof gold. In a recess was a kind of divan, surmounted with a stand of\nArabian swords in silver scabbards, and the handles resplendent with\ngems; from the ceiling hung a lamp of Venetian glass, of beautiful\nshape and color, while the feet rested on a Turkey carpet, in which\nthey sunk to the instep; tapestry hung before the door by which Franz\nhad entered, and also in front of "}, {"chunk_id": 71, "text": "inspector; “and the abbé’s plan\nhas not even the merit of originality.”\n\nThen turning to Faria, “I inquired if you are well fed?” said he.\n\n“Swear to me,” replied Faria, “to free me if what I tell you prove\ntrue, and I will stay here while you go to the spot.”\n\n“Are you well fed?” repeated the inspector.\n\n“Monsieur, you run no risk, for, as I told you, I will stay here; so\nthere is no chance of my escaping.”\n\n“You do not reply to my question,” replied the inspector impatiently.\n\n“Nor you to mine,” cried the abbé. “You will not accept my gold; I will\nkeep it for myself. You refuse me my liberty; God will give it me.” And\nthe abbé, casting away his coverlet, resumed his place, and continued\nhis calculations.\n\n0177m\n\n\n\n“What is he doing there?” said the inspector.\n\n“Counting his treasures,” replied the governor.\n\nFaria replied to this sarcasm with a glance of profound contempt. They\nwent out. The turnkey closed the door behind them.\n\n“He was wealthy once, perhaps?” said the inspector.\n\n“Or dreamed he was, and awoke mad.”\n\n“After all,” said the inspector, “if he had been rich, he would not\nhave been here.”\n\nSo the matter ended for the Abbé Faria. He remained in his cell, and\nthis visit only increased the belief in his insanity.\n\nCaligula or Nero, those treasure-seekers, those desirers of the\nimpossible, would have accorded to the poor wretch, in exchange for his\nwealth, the liberty he so earnestly prayed for. But the kings of modern\ntimes, restrained by the limits of mere probability, have neither\ncourage nor desire. They fear the ear that hears their orders, and the\neye that scrutinizes their actions. Formerly they believed themselves\nsprung from Jupiter, and shielded by their birth; but nowadays they are\nnot inviolable.\n\nIt has always been against the policy of despotic governments to suffer\nthe victims of their persecutions to reappear. As the Inquisition\nrarely allowed its victims to be seen with their limbs distorted and\ntheir flesh lacerated by torture, so madness is always concealed in its\ncell, from whence, should it depart, it is conveyed to some gloomy\nhospital, where the doctor has no thought for man or mind in the\nmutilated being the jailer delivers to him. The very madness of the\nAbbé Faria, gone mad in prison, condemned him to perpetual captivity.\n\nThe inspector kept his word with Dantès; he examined the register, and\nfound the following note concerning him:\n\n_Edmond Dantès:_\n\nViolent Bonapartist; took an active part in the return from Elba.\n\nThe greatest watchfulness and care to be exercised.\n\nThis note was in a different hand from the rest, which showed that it\nhad been added since his confinement. The inspector could not contend\nagainst this accusation; he simply wrote, _Nothing to be done._\n\nThis visit had infused new vigor into Dantès; he had, till then,\nforgotten the date; but now, with a fragment of plaster, he wrote the\ndate, 30th July, 1816, and made a mark every day, in order not to lose\nhis reckoning again. Days and weeks passed away, then months—Dantès\nstill waited; he at first expected to be freed in a fortnight. This\nfortnight expired, he decided that the inspector would do nothing until\nhis return to Paris, and that he would not reach there until his\ncircuit was finished, he therefore fixed three months; three months\npassed away, then six more. Finally ten months and a half had gone by\nand no favorable change had taken place, and Dantès began to fancy the\ninspector’s visit but a dream, an illusion of the brain.\n\nAt the expiration of a year the governor was transferred; he had\nobtained charge of the fortress at Ham. He took with him several of his\nsubordinates, and amongst them Dantès’ jailer. A new governor arrived;\nit would have been too tedious to acquire the names of the prisoners;\nhe learned their numbers instead. This horrible place contained fifty\ncells; their inhabitants were designated by the numbers of their cell,\nand the unhappy young man was no longer called Edmond Dantès—he was now\nnumber 3"}, {"chunk_id": 99, "text": "o the walls of a prison.\nNone can fly from a dungeon who cannot walk.”\n\n“Well, we will wait,—a week, a month, two months, if need be,—and\nmeanwhile your strength will return. Everything is in readiness for our\nflight, and we can select any time we choose. As soon as you feel able\nto swim we will go.”\n\n“I shall never swim again,” replied Faria. “This arm is paralyzed; not\nfor a time, but forever. Lift it, and judge if I am mistaken.”\n\nThe young man raised the arm, which fell back by its own weight,\nperfectly inanimate and helpless. A sigh escaped him.\n\n“You are convinced now, Edmond, are you not?” asked the abbé. “Depend\nupon it, I know what I say. Since the first attack I experienced of\nthis malady, I have continually reflected on it. Indeed, I expected it,\nfor it is a family inheritance; both my father and grandfather died of\nit in a third attack. The physician who prepared for me the remedy I\nhave twice successfully taken, was no other than the celebrated\nCabanis, and he predicted a similar end for me.”\n\n0233m\n\n\n\n“The physician may be mistaken!” exclaimed Dantès. “And as for your\npoor arm, what difference will that make? I can take you on my\nshoulders, and swim for both of us.”\n\n“My son,” said the abbé, “you, who are a sailor and a swimmer, must\nknow as well as I do that a man so loaded would sink before he had done\nfifty strokes. Cease, then, to allow yourself to be duped by vain\nhopes, that even your own excellent heart refuses to believe in. Here I\nshall remain till the hour of my deliverance arrives, and that, in all\nhuman probability, will be the hour of my death. As for you, who are\nyoung and active, delay not on my account, but fly—go—I give you back\nyour promise.”\n\n“It is well,” said Dantès. “Then I shall also remain.” Then, rising and\nextending his hand with an air of solemnity over the old man’s head, he\nslowly added, “By the blood of Christ I swear never to leave you while\nyou live.”\n\nFaria gazed fondly on his noble-minded, single-hearted, high-principled\nyoung friend, and read in his countenance ample confirmation of the\nsincerity of his devotion and the loyalty of his purpose.\n\n“Thanks,” murmured the invalid, extending one hand. “I accept. You may\none of these days reap the reward of your disinterested devotion. But\nas I cannot, and you will not, quit this place, it becomes necessary to\nfill up the excavation beneath the soldier’s gallery; he might, by\nchance, hear the hollow sound of his footsteps, and call the attention\nof his officer to the circumstance. That would bring about a discovery\nwhich would inevitably lead to our being separated. Go, then, and set\nabout this work, in which, unhappily, I can offer you no assistance;\nkeep at it all night, if necessary, and do not return here tomorrow\ntill after the jailer has visited me. I shall have something of the\ngreatest importance to communicate to you.”\n\nDantès took the hand of the abbé in his, and affectionately pressed it.\nFaria smiled encouragingly on him, and the young man retired to his\ntask, in the spirit of obedience and respect which he had sworn to show\ntowards his aged friend.\n\n\n\n Chapter 18. The Treasure\n\nWhen Dantès returned next morning to the chamber of his companion in\ncaptivity, he found Faria seated and looking composed. In the ray of\nlight which entered by the narrow window of his cell, he held open in\nhis left hand, of which alone, it will be recollected, he retained the\nuse, a sheet of paper, which, from being constantly rolled into a small\ncompass, had the form of a cylinder, and was not easily kept open. He\ndid not speak, but showed the paper to Dantès.\n\n“What is that?” he inquired.\n\n“Look at it,” said the abbé with a smile.\n\n“I have looked at it with all possible attention,” said Dantès, “and I\nonly see a half-burnt paper, on which are traces of Gothic characters\ninscribed with a peculiar kind of ink.”\n\n“This paper, my friend,” said Faria, “I may now avow to you, since I\nhave the proof of your fidelity—this paper is my treasure, of which,"}, {"chunk_id": 121, "text": "e to find employment.”\n\n“Do you know the Mediterranean?”\n\n“I have sailed over it since my childhood.”\n\n“You know the best harbors?”\n\n“There are few ports that I could not enter or leave with a bandage\nover my eyes.”\n\n“I say, captain,” said the sailor who had cried “Courage!” to Dantès,\n“if what he says is true, what hinders his staying with us?”\n\n“If he says true,” said the captain doubtingly. “But in his present\ncondition he will promise anything, and take his chance of keeping it\nafterwards.”\n\n“I will do more than I promise,” said Dantès.\n\n“We shall see,” returned the other, smiling.\n\n“Where are you going?” asked Dantès.\n\n“To Leghorn.”\n\n“Then why, instead of tacking so frequently, do you not sail nearer the\nwind?”\n\n“Because we should run straight on to the Island of Rion.”\n\n“You shall pass it by twenty fathoms.”\n\n“Take the helm, and let us see what you know.”\n\nThe young man took the helm, felt to see if the vessel answered the\nrudder promptly and seeing that, without being a first-rate sailor, she\nyet was tolerably obedient.\n\n“To the sheets,” said he. The four seamen, who composed the crew,\nobeyed, while the pilot looked on. “Haul taut.”\n\nThey obeyed.\n\n“Belay.” This order was also executed; and the vessel passed, as Dantès\nhad predicted, twenty fathoms to windward.\n\n“Bravo!” said the captain.\n\n“Bravo!” repeated the sailors. And they all looked with astonishment at\nthis man whose eye now disclosed an intelligence and his body a vigor\nthey had not thought him capable of showing.\n\n“You see,” said Dantès, quitting the helm, “I shall be of some use to\nyou, at least during the voyage. If you do not want me at Leghorn, you\ncan leave me there, and I will pay you out of the first wages I get,\nfor my food and the clothes you lend me.”\n\n“Ah,” said the captain, “we can agree very well, if you are\nreasonable.”\n\n“Give me what you give the others, and it will be all right,” returned\nDantès.\n\n“That’s not fair,” said the seaman who had saved Dantès; “for you know\nmore than we do.”\n\n“What is that to you, Jacopo?” returned the Captain. “Everyone is free\nto ask what he pleases.”\n\n“That’s true,” replied Jacopo; “I only make a remark.”\n\n“Well, you would do much better to find him a jacket and a pair of\ntrousers, if you have them.”\n\n“No,” said Jacopo; “but I have a shirt and a pair of trousers.”\n\n“That is all I want,” interrupted Dantès. Jacopo dived into the hold\nand soon returned with what Edmond wanted.\n\n“Now, then, do you wish for anything else?” said the patron.\n\n“A piece of bread and another glass of the capital rum I tasted, for I\nhave not eaten or drunk for a long time.” He had not tasted food for\nforty hours. A piece of bread was brought, and Jacopo offered him the\ngourd.\n\n“Larboard your helm,” cried the captain to the steersman. Dantès\nglanced that way as he lifted the gourd to his mouth; then paused with\nhand in mid-air.\n\n“Hollo! what’s the matter at the Château d’If?” said the captain.\n\nA small white cloud, which had attracted Dantès’ attention, crowned the\nsummit of the bastion of the Château d’If. At the same moment the faint\nreport of a gun was heard. The sailors looked at one another.\n\n“What is this?” asked the captain.\n\n“A prisoner has escaped from the Château d’If, and they are firing the\nalarm gun,” replied Dantès. The captain glanced at him, but he had\nlifted the rum to his lips and was drinking it with so much composure,\nthat suspicions, if the captain had any, died away.\n\n0277m\n\n\n\n“Pretty strong rum!” said Dantès, wiping his brow with his sleeve.\n\n“At any rate,” murmured he, “if it be, so much the better, for I have\nmade a rare acquisition.”\n\n0279m\n\n\n\nUnder pretence of being fatigued, Dantès asked to take the helm; the\nsteersman, glad to be relieved, looked at the captain, and the latter\nby a sign indicated that he might abandon it to his new comrade. Dantès\ncould thus keep his eyes on Marseilles.\n\n“What is the day of the month?” asked he of Jacopo, who sat down beside\nhim.\n\n“The 28th of February.”\n\n“In what year?”\n\n“In what "}]}

I am in a\nhurry to begin. I want to learn.”\n\n“Everything,” said the abbé. And that very evening the prisoners\nsketched a plan of education, to be entered upon the following day.\nDantès possessed a prodigious memory, combined with an astonishing\nquickness and readiness of conception; the mathematical turn of his\nmind rendered him apt at all kinds of calculation, while his naturally\npoetical feelings threw a light and pleasing veil over the dry reality\nof arithmetical computation, or the rigid severity of geometry. He\nalready knew Italian, and had also picked up a little of the Romaic\ndialect during voyages to the East; and by the aid of these two\nlanguages he easily comprehended the construction of all the others, so\nthat at the end of six months he began to speak Spanish, English, and\nGerman.\n\nIn strict accordance with the promise made to the abbé, Dantès spoke no\nmore of escape. Perhaps the delight his studies afforded him left no\nroom for such thoughts; perhaps the recollection that he had pledged\nhis word (on which his sense of honor was keen) kept him from referring\nin any way to the possibilities of flight. Days, even months, passed by\nunheeded in one rapid and instructive course. At the end of a year\nDantès was a new man. Dantès observed, however, that Faria, in spite of\nthe relief his society afforded, daily grew sadder; one thought seemed\nincessantly to harass and distract his mind. Sometimes he would fall\ninto long reveries, sigh heavily and involuntarily, then suddenly rise,\nand, with folded arms, begin pacing the confined space of his dungeon.\nOne day he stopped all at once, and exclaimed:\n\n“Ah, if there were no sentinel!”\n\n“There shall not be one a minute longer than you please,” said Dantès,\nwho had followed the working of his thoughts as accurately as though\nhis brain were enclosed in crystal so clear as to display its minutest\noperations.\n\n“I have already told you,” answered the abbé, “that I loathe the idea\nof shedding blood.”\n\n“And yet the murder, if you choose to call it so, would be simply a\nmeasure of self-preservation.”\n\n“No matter! I could never agree to it.”\n\n“Still, you have thought of it?”\n\n“Incessantly, alas!” cried the abbé.\n\n“And you have discovered a means of regaining our freedom, have you\nnot?” asked Dantès eagerly.\n\n“I have; if it were only possible to place a deaf and blind sentinel in\nthe gallery beyond us.”\n\n“He shall be both blind and deaf,” replied the young man, with an air\nof determination that made his companion shudder.\n\n“No, no,” cried the abbé; “impossible!”\n\nDantès endeavored to renew the subject; the abbé shook his head in\ntoken of disapproval, and refused to make any further response. Three\nmonths passed away.\n\n“Are you strong?” the abbé asked one day of Dantès. The young man, in\nreply, took up the chisel, bent it into the form of a horseshoe, and\nthen as readily straightened it.\n\n“And will you engage not to do any harm to the sentry, except as a last\nresort?”\n\n“I promise on my honor.”\n\n“Then,” said the abbé, “we may hope to put our design into execution.”\n\n“And how long shall we be in accomplishing the necessary work?”\n\n“At least a year.”\n\n“And shall we begin at once?”\n\n“At once.”\n\n“We have lost a year to no purpose!” cried Dantès.\n\n“Do you consider the last twelve months to have been wasted?” asked the\nabbé.\n\n“Forgive me!” cried Edmond, blushing deeply.\n\n“Tut, tut!” answered the abbé, “man is but man after all, and you are\nabout the best specimen of the genus I have ever known. Come, let me\nsh"}, {"chunk_id": 368, "text": "To be a great chemist in the East,\none must direct chance; and this is to be achieved.”\n\nMadame de Villefort was in deep thought, yet listened attentively.\n\n“But,” she exclaimed, suddenly, “arsenic is indelible, indestructible;\nin whatsoever way it is absorbed, it will be found again in the body of\nthe victim from the moment when it has been taken in sufficient\nquantity to cause death.”\n\n“Precisely so,” cried Monte Cristo—“precisely so; and this is what I\nsaid to my worthy Adelmonte. He reflected, smiled, and replied to me by\na Sicilian proverb, which I believe is also a French proverb, ‘My son,\nthe world was not made in a day—but in seven.

Instead of having watered his\ncabbage with arsenic, he had watered it this time with a solution of\nsalts, having their basis in strychnine, _strychnos colubrina_, as the\nlearned term it. Now, the cabbage had not the slightest appearance of\ndisease in the world, and the rabbit had not the smallest distrust;\nyet, five minutes afterwards, the rabbit was dead. The fowl pecked at\nthe rabbit, and the next day was a dead hen.

You will find very few persons who will go and\nbrutally thrust a knife in the heart of a fellow-creature, or will\nadminister to him, in order to remove him from the surface of the globe\non which we move with life and animation, that quantity of arsenic of\nwhich we just now talked. Such a thing is really out of rule—eccentric\nor stupid. To attain such a point, the blood must be heated to\nthirty-six degrees, the pulse be, at least, at ninety, and the feelings\nexcited beyond the ordinary limit. But suppose one pass, as is\npermissible in philology, from the word itself to its softened synonym,\nthen, instead of committing an ignoble assassination you make an\n‘elimination;’ you merely and simply remove from your path the\nindividual who is in your way, and that without shock or violence,\nwithout the display of the sufferings which, in the case of becoming a\npunishment, make a martyr of the victim, and a butcher, in every sense\nof the word, of him who inflicts them. Then there will be no blood, no\ngroans, no convulsions, and above all, no consciousness of that horrid\nand compromising moment of accomplishing the act,—then one escapes the\nclutch of the human law, which says, ‘Do not disturb society!’ This is\nthe mode in which they manage these things, and succeed in Eastern\nclimes, where there are grave and phlegmatic persons who car"}, {"chunk_id": 161, "text": "as educated at Rome by a poor devil of an abbé, who\ndisappeared suddenly. I have since learned that he was confined in the\nChâteau d’If, and I should like to learn some particulars of his\ndeath.”\n\n“What was his name?”\n\n“The Abbé Faria.”\n\n“Oh, I recollect him perfectly,” cried M. de Boville; “he was crazy.”\n\n“So they said.”\n\n“Oh, he was, decidedly.”\n\n“Very possibly; but what sort of madness was it?”\n\n“He pretended to know of an immense treasure, and offered vast sums to\nthe government if they would liberate him.”\n\n“Poor devil!—and he is dead?”\n\n“Yes, sir, five or six months ago, last February.”\n\n“You have a good memory, sir, to recollect dates so well.”\n\n“I recollect this, because the poor devil’s death was accompanied by a\nsingular incident.”\n\n“May I ask what that was?” said the Englishman with an expression of\ncuriosity, which a close observer would have been astonished at\ndiscovering in his phlegmatic countenance.\n\n“Oh dear, yes, sir; the abbé’s dungeon was forty or fifty feet distant\nfrom that of one of Bonaparte’s emissaries,—one of those who had\ncontributed the most to the return of the usurper in 1815, a very\nresolute and very dangerous man.”\n\n“Indeed!” said the Englishman.\n\n“Yes,” replied M. de Boville; “I myself had occasion to see this man in\n1816 or 1817, and we could only go into his dungeon with a file of\nsoldiers. That man made a deep impression on me; I shall never forget\nhis countenance!”\n\n20025m\n\n\n\nThe Englishman smiled imperceptibly.\n\n“And you say, sir,” he interposed, “that the two dungeons——”\n\n“Were separated by a distance of fifty feet; but it appears that this\nEdmond Dantès——”\n\n“This dangerous man’s name was——”\n\n“Edmond Dantès. It appears, sir, that this Edmond Dantès had procured\ntools, or made them, for they found a tunnel through which the\nprisoners held communication with one another.”\n\n“This tunnel was dug, no doubt, with an intention of escape?”\n\n“No doubt; but unfortunately for the prisoners, the Abbé Faria had an\nattack of catalepsy, and died.”\n\n“That must have cut short the projects of escape.”\n\n“For the dead man, yes,” replied M. de Boville, “but not for the\nsurvivor; on the contrary, this Dantès saw a means of accelerating his\nescape. He, no doubt, thought that prisoners who died in the Château\nd’If were interred in an ordinary burial-ground, and he conveyed the\ndead man into his own cell, took his place in the sack in which they\nhad sewed up the corpse, and awaited the moment of interment.”\n\n“It was a bold step, and one that showed some courage,” remarked the\nEnglishman.\n\n“As I have already told you, sir, he was a very dangerous man; and,\nfortunately, by his own act disembarrassed the government of the fears\nit had on his account.”\n\n“How was that?”\n\n“How? Do you not comprehend?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“The Château d’If has no cemetery, and they simply throw the dead into\nthe sea, after fastening a thirty-six-pound cannon-ball to their feet.”\n\n“Well?” observed the Englishman as if he were slow of comprehension.\n\n“Well, they fastened a thirty-six-pound ball to his feet, and threw him\ninto the sea.”\n\n“Really!” exclaimed the Englishman.\n\n“Yes, sir,” continued the inspector of prisons. “You may imagine the\namazement of the fugitive when he found himself flung headlong over the\nrocks! I should like to have seen his face at that moment.”\n\n“That would have been difficult.”\n\n“No matter,” replied De Boville, in supreme good-humor at the certainty\nof recovering his two hundred thousand francs,—“no matter, I can fancy\nit.” And he shouted with laughter.\n\n“So can I,” said the Englishman, and he laughed too; but he laughed as\nthe English do, “at the end of his teeth.”\n\n“And so,” continued the Englishman who first gained his composure, “he\nwas drowned?”\n\n“Unquestionably.”\n\n“So that the governor got rid of the dangerous and the crazy prisoner\nat the same time?”\n\n“Precisely.”\n\n20027m\n\n\n\n“But some official document was drawn up as to this affair, I suppose?”\ninquired the Englishman.\n\n“Yes, yes, the mortuary deposition.

Is it not\ntempting what I offer you, and is it not an easy thing, since it is\nonly to do thus? look!”\n\nAt these words he uncovered the small cup which contained the substance\nso lauded, took a teaspoonful of the magic sweetmeat, raised it to his\nlips, and swallowed it slowly with his eyes half shut and his head bent\nbackwards. Franz did not disturb him whilst he absorbed his favorite\nsweetmeat, but when he had finished, he inquired:\n\n“What, then, is this precious stuff?”\n\n“Did you ever hear,” he replied, “of the Old Man of the Mountain, who\nattempted to assassinate Philippe Auguste?”\n\n“Of course I have.”\n\n“Well, you know he reigned over a rich valley which was overhung by the\nmountain whence he derived his picturesque name. In this valley were\nmagnificent gardens planted by Hassen-ben-Sabah, and in these gardens\nisolated pavilions. Into these pavilions he admitted the elect, and\nthere, says Marco Polo, gave them to eat a certain herb, which\ntransported them to Paradise, in the midst of ever-blooming shrubs,\never-ripe fruit, and ever-lovely virgins. What these happy persons took\nfor reality was but a dream; but it was a dream so soft, so voluptuous,\nso enthralling, that they sold themselves body and soul to him who gave\nit to them, and obedient to his orders as to those of a deity, struck\ndown the designated victim, died in torture without a murmur, believing\nthat the death they underwent was but a quick transition to that life\nof delights of which the holy herb, now before you, had given them a\nslight foretaste.”\n\n“Then,” cried Franz, “it is hashish! I know that—by name at least.”\n\n“That is it precisely, Signor Aladdin; it is hashish—the purest and\nmost unadulterated hashish of Alexandria,—the hashish of Abou-Gor, the\ncelebrated maker, the only man, the man to whom there should be built a\npalace, inscribed with these words, _A grateful world to the dealer in\nhappiness_.”\n\n“Do you know,” said Franz, “I have a very great inclination to judge\nfor myself of the truth or exaggeration of your eulogies.”\n\n“Judge for yourself, Signor Aladdin—judge, but do not confine yourself\nto one trial. Like everything else, we must habituate the senses to a\nfresh impression, gentle or violent, sad or joyous. There is a struggle\nin nature against this divine substance,—in nature which is not made\nfor joy and clings to pain. Nature subdued must yield in the combat,\nthe dream must succeed to reality, and then the dream reigns supreme,\nthen the dream becomes life, and life becomes the dream. But what\nchanges occur! It is only by comparing the pains of actual being with\nthe joys of the assumed existence, that you would desire to live no\nlonger, but to dream thus forever. When you return to this mundane\nsphere from your visionary world, you would seem to leave a Neapolitan\nspring for a Lapland winter—to quit paradise for earth—heaven for hell!\nTaste the hashish, guest of mine—taste the hashish.”\n\nFranz’s only reply was to take a teaspoonful of the marvellous\npreparation, about as much in quantity as his host had eaten, and lift\nit to his mouth.\n\n“_Diable!_” he said, after having swallowed the divine preserve. “I do\nnot know if the result will be as agreeable as you describe, but the\nthing does not appear to me as palatable as you say.”\n\n“Because your palate his not yet been attuned to the sublimity of the\nsubstances it flavors.

The thing was discussed for a long time, but finally decided\nin his favor. I can assure you the vertebra made a great noise in the\nlearned world, and the gentleman, who was only a knight of the Legion\nof Honor, was made an officer.”\n\n“Come,” said Monte Cristo, “this cross seems to me to be wisely\nawarded. I suppose, had he found another additional vertebra, they\nwould have made him a commander.”\n\n“Very likely,” said Albert.\n\n“And who can that person be who has taken it into his head to wrap\nhimself up in a blue coat embroidered with green?”\n\n“Oh, that coat is not his own idea; it is the Republic’s, which deputed\nDavid12 to devise a uniform for the Academicians.”\n\n“Indeed?” said Monte Cristo; “so this gentleman is an Academician?”\n\n“Within the last week he has been made one of the learned assembly.”\n\n“And what is his especial talent?”\n\n“His talent? I believe he thrusts pins through the heads of rabbits, he\nmakes fowls eat madder, and punches the spinal marrow out of dogs with\nwhalebone.”\n\n“And he is made a member of the Academy of Sciences for this?”\n\n“No; of the French Academy.”\n\n“But what has the French Academy to do with all this?”\n\n“I was going to tell you. It seems——”\n\n“That his experiments have very considerably advanced the cause of\nscience, doubtless?”\n\n“No; that his style of writing is very good.”\n\n“This must be very flattering to the feelings of the rabbits into whose\nheads he has thrust pins, to the fowls whose bones he has dyed red, and\nto the dogs whose spinal marrow he has punched out?”\n\nAlbert laughed.\n\n“And the other one?” demanded the count.\n\n“That one?”\n\n“Yes, the third.”\n\n“The one in the dark blue coat?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“He is a colleague of the count, and one of the most active opponents\nto the idea of providing the Chamber of Peers with a uniform. He was\nvery successful upon that question. He stood badly with the Liberal\npapers, but his noble opposition to the wishes of the court is now\ngetting him into favor with the journalists. They talk of making him an\nambassador.”\n\n30303m\n\n\n\n“And what are his claims to the peerage?”\n\n“He has composed two or three comic operas, written four or five\narticles in the _Siècle_, and voted five or six years on the\nministerial side.”\n\n“Bravo, viscount,” said Monte Cristo, smiling; “you are a delightful\n_cicerone_. And now you will do me a favor, will you not?”\n\n“What is it?”\n\n“Do not introduce me to any of these gentlemen; and should they wish\nit, you will warn me.” Just then the count felt his arm pressed. He\nturned round; it was Danglars.\n\n“Ah! is it you, baron?” said he.\n\n“Why do you call me baron?” said Danglars; “you know that I care\nnothing for my title. I am not like you, viscount; you like your title,\ndo you not?”\n\n“Certainly,” replied Albert, “seeing that without my title I should be\nnothing; while you, sacrificing the baron, would still remain the\nmillionaire.”\n\n“Which seems to me the finest title under the royalty of July,” replied\nDanglars.\n\n“Unfortunately,” said Monte Cristo, “one’s title to a millionaire does\nnot last for life, like that of baron, peer of France, or academician;\nfor example, the millionaires Franck & Poulmann, of Frankfurt, who have\njust become bankrupts.”\n\n“Indeed?” said Danglars, becoming pale.\n\n“Yes; I received the news this evening by a courier. I had about a\nmillion in their hands, but, warned in time, I withdrew it a month\nago.”\n\n“Ah, _mon Dieu!_” exclaimed Danglars, “they have drawn on me for\n200,000 francs!”\n\n“Well, you can throw out the draft; their signature is worth five per\ncent.”\n\n“Yes, but it is too late,” said Danglars, “I have honored their bills.”\n\n“Then,” said Monte Cristo, “here are 200,000 francs gone after——”\n\n“Hush, do not mention these things,” said Da"}]}

Thus a new, a\nstronger, and more inexorable barrier was interposed to cut off the\nrealization of their hopes.\n\n“You see,” said the young man, with an air of sorrowful resignation, to\nFaria, “that God deems it right to take from me any claim to merit for\nwhat you call my devotion to you. I have promised to remain forever\nwith you, and now I could not break my promise if I would. The treasure\nwill be no more mine than yours, and neither of us will quit this\nprison. But my real treasure is not that, my dear friend, which awaits\nme beneath the sombre rocks of Monte Cristo, it is your presence, our\nliving together five or six hours a day, in spite of our jailers; it is\nthe rays of intelligence you have elicited from my brain, the languages\nyou have implanted in my memory, and which have taken root there with\nall their philological ramifications. These different sciences that you\nhave made so easy to me by the depth of the knowledge you possess of\nthem, and the clearness of the principles to which you have reduced\nthem—this is my treasure, my beloved friend, and with this you have\nmade me rich and happy. Believe me, and take comfort, this is better\nfor me than tons of gold and cases of diamonds, even were they not as\nproblematical as the clouds we see in the morning floating over the\nsea, which we take for _terra firma_, and which evaporate and vanish as\nwe draw near to them. To have you as long as possible near me, to hear\nyour eloquent speech,—which embellishes my mind, strengthens my soul,\nand makes my whole frame capable of great and terrible things, if I\nshould ever be free,—so fills my whole existence, that the despair to\nwhich I was just on the point of yielding when I knew you, has no\nlonger any hold over me; and this—this is my fortune—not chimerical,\nbut actual. I owe you my real good, my present happiness; and all the\nsovereigns of the earth, even Cæsar Borgia himself, could not deprive\nme of this.”\n\nThus, if not actually happy, yet the days these two unfortunates passed\ntogether went quickly. Faria, who for so long a time had kept silence\nas to the treasure, now perpetually talked of it. As he had prophesied\nwould be the case, he remained paralyzed in the right arm and the left\nleg, and had given up all hope of ever enjoying it himself. But he was\ncontinually thinking over some means of escape for his young companion,\nand anticipating the pleasure he would enjoy. For fear the letter might\nbe some day lost or stolen, he compelled Dantès to learn it by heart;\nand Dantès knew it from the first to the last word. Then he destroyed\nthe second portion, assured that if the first were seized, no one would\nbe able to discover its real meaning. Whole hours sometimes passed\nwhile Faria was giving instructions to Dantès,—instructions which were\nto serve him when he was at liberty. Then, once free, from the day and\nhour and moment when he was so, he could have but one only thought,\nwhich was, to gain Monte Cristo by some means, and remain there alone\nunder some pretext which would arouse no suspicions; and once there, to\nendeavor to find the wonderful caverns, and search in the appointed\nspot,—the appointed spot, be it remembered, being the farthest angle in\nthe second opening.\n\nIn the meanwhile the hours passed, if not rapidly, at least tolerably.\nFaria, as we have said, without having recovered the use of his hand\nand foot, had regained all the clearness of his understanding, and had\ngradually, besides the moral instructions we have detailed, taught his\nyouthful companion the patient and sublime duty of a prisoner, who\nlearns to make something from nothing. They were thus perpetually\nemployed,—Faria, that he might not see himself grow old; Dantès, for\nfear of recalling the almost extinct past which now only floated in his\nmemory like a distant light wandering in the night.

Then, having renewed his\ninjunction not to give Valentine anything, he went down again to\nNoirtier, shut the doors carefully, and after convincing himself that\nno one was listening:\n\n“Do you,” said he, “know anything of this young lady’s illness?”\n\n“Yes,” said the old man.\n\n“We have no time to lose; I will question, and do you answer me.”\nNoirtier made a sign that he was ready to answer. “Did you anticipate\nthe accident which has happened to your granddaughter?”\n\n“Yes.” D’Avrigny reflected a moment; then approaching Noirtier:\n\n“Pardon what I am going to say,” added he, “but no indication should be\nneglected in this terrible situation. Did you see poor Barrois die?”\nNoirtier raised his eyes to heaven.\n\n“Do you know of what he died!” asked d’Avrigny, placing his hand on\nNoirtier’s shoulder.\n\n“Yes,” replied the old man.\n\n“Do you think he died a natural death?” A sort of smile was discernible\non the motionless lips of Noirtier.\n\n“Then you have thought that Barrois was poisoned?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Do you think the poison he fell a victim to was intended for him?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Do you think the same hand which unintentionally struck Barrois has\nnow attacked Valentine?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Then will she die too?” asked d’Avrigny, fixing his penetrating gaze\non Noirtier. He watched the effect of this question on the old man.\n\n“No,” replied he with an air of triumph which would have puzzled the\nmost clever diviner.\n\n“Then you hope?” said d’Avrigny, with surprise.\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“What do you hope?” The old man made him understand with his eyes that\nhe could not answer.\n\n“Ah, yes, it is true,” murmured d’Avrigny. Then, turning to\nNoirtier,—“Do you hope the assassin will be tried?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Then you hope the poison will take no effect on Valentine?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“It is no news to you,” added d’Avrigny, “to tell you that an attempt\nhas been made to poison her?” The old man made a sign that he\nentertained no doubt upon the subject. “Then how do you hope Valentine\nwill escape?”\n\nNoirtier kept his eyes steadfastly fixed on the same spot. D’Avrigny\nfollowed the direction and saw that they were fixed on a bottle\ncontaining the mixture which he took every morning. “Ah, indeed?” said\nd’Avrigny, struck with a sudden thought, “has it occurred to\nyou”—Noirtier did not let him finish.\n\n“Yes,” said he.\n\n“To prepare her system to resist poison?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“By accustoming her by degrees——”\n\n“Yes, yes, yes,” said Noirtier, delighted to be understood.\n\n“Of course. I had told you that there was brucine in the mixture I give\nyou.”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“And by accustoming her to that poison, you have endeavored to\nneutralize the effect of a similar poison?” Noirtier’s joy continued.\n“And you have succeeded,” exclaimed d’Avrigny. “Without that precaution\nValentine would have died before assistance could have been procured.\nThe dose has been excessive, but she has only been shaken by it; and\nthis time, at any rate, Valentine will not die.”\n\nA superhuman joy expanded the old man’s eyes, which were raised towards\nheaven with an expression of infinite gratitude. At this moment\nVillefort returned.\n\n“Here, doctor,” said he, “is what you sent me for.”\n\n“Was this prepared in your presence?”\n\n“Yes,” replied the procureur.\n\n“Have you not let it go out of your hands?”\n\n“No.”\n\nD’Avrigny took the bottle, poured some drops of the mixture it\ncontained in the hollow of his hand, and swallowed them.\n\n“Well,” said he, “let us go to Valentine; I will give instructions to\neveryone, and you, M. de Villefort, will yourself see that no one\ndeviates from them.”\n\n40294m\n\n\n\nAt the moment when d’Avrigny was returning to Valentine’s room,\naccompanied by Villefort, an Italian priest, of serious demeanor and\ncalm an"}, {"chunk_id": 341, "text": " am not an\nItalian, or a Frenchman, or a Hindu, or an American, or a Spaniard—I am\na cosmopolite.

It follows from this, that\nthe king’s attorney, be he who he may, with whom I should have to deal,\nwould assuredly be more embarrassed than I should.”\n\n“That is to say,” replied Villefort with hesitation, “that human nature\nbeing weak, every man, according to your creed, has committed faults.”\n\n“Faults or crimes,” responded Monte Cristo with a negligent air.\n\n“And that you alone, amongst the men whom you do not recognize as your\nbrothers—for you have said so,” observed Villefort in a tone that\nfaltered somewhat—“you alone are perfect.”\n\n“No, not perfect,” was the count’s reply; “only impenetrable, that’s\nall. But let us leave off this strain, sir, if the tone of it is\ndispleasing to you; I am no more disturbed by your justice than are you\nby my second-sight.”\n\n“No, no,—by no means,” said Villefort, who was afraid of seeming to\nabandon his ground. “No; by your brilliant and almost sublime\nconversation you have elevated me above the ordinary level; we no\nlonger talk, we rise to dissertation.

But besides all this, in order that the instrument may not be\ncontested, I am anxious to give it the greatest possible authenticity,\ntherefore, one of my colleagues will help me, and, contrary to custom,\nwill assist in the dictation of the testament. Are you satisfied, sir?”\ncontinued the notary, addressing the old man.\n\n30175m\n\n\n\n“Yes,” looked the invalid, his eye beaming with delight at the ready\ninterpretation of his meaning.\n\n“What is he going to do?” thought Villefort, whose position demanded\nmuch reserve, but who was longing to know what his father’s intentions\nwere. He left the room to give orders for another notary to be sent,\nbut Barrois, who had heard all that passed, had guessed his master’s\nwishes, and had already gone to fetch one. The procureur then told his\nwife to come up. In the course of a quarter of an hour everyone had\nassembled in the chamber of the paralytic; the second notary had also\narrived.\n\nA few words sufficed for a mutual understanding between the two\nofficers of the law. They read to Noirtier the formal copy of a will,\nin order to give him an idea of the terms in which such documents are\ngenerally couched; then, in order to test the capacity of the testator,\nthe first notary said, turning toward"}, {"chunk_id": 114, "text": " die? It is very easy,” he went on\nwith a smile; “I will remain here, rush on the first person that opens\nthe door, strangle him, and then they will guillotine me.”\n\nBut excessive grief is like a storm at sea, where the frail bark is\ntossed from the depths to the top of the wave. Dantès recoiled from the\nidea of so infamous a death, and passed suddenly from despair to an\nardent desire for life and liberty.\n\n“Die? oh, no,” he exclaimed—“not die now, after having lived and\nsuffered so long and so much! Die? yes, had I died years ago; but now\nto die would be, indeed, to give way to the sarcasm of destiny. No, I\nwant to live; I shall struggle to the very last; I will yet win back\nthe happiness of which I have been deprived. Before I die I must not\nforget that I have my executioners to punish, and perhaps, too, who\nknows, some friends to reward. Yet they will forget me here, and I\nshall die in my dungeon like Faria.”\n\nAs he said this, he became silent and gazed straight before him like\none overwhelmed with a strange and amazing thought. Suddenly he arose,\nlifted his hand to his brow as if his brain were giddy, paced twice or\nthrice round the dungeon, and then paused abruptly by the bed.\n\n“Just God!” he muttered, “whence comes this thought? Is it from thee?\nSince none but the dead pass freely from this dungeon, let me take the\nplace of the dead!”\n\nWithout giving himself time to reconsider his decision, and, indeed,\nthat he might not allow his thoughts to be distracted from his\ndesperate resolution, he bent over the appalling shroud, opened it with\nthe knife which Faria had made, drew the corpse from the sack, and bore\nit along the tunnel to his own chamber, laid it on his couch, tied\naround its head the rag he wore at night around his own, covered it\nwith his counterpane, once again kissed the ice-cold brow, and tried\nvainly to close the resisting eyes, which glared horribly, turned the\nhead towards the wall, so that the jailer might, when he brought the\nevening meal, believe that he was asleep, as was his frequent custom;\nentered the tunnel again, drew the bed against the wall, returned to\nthe other cell, took from the hiding-place the needle and thread, flung\noff his rags, that they might feel only naked flesh beneath the coarse\ncanvas, and getting inside the sack, placed himself in the posture in\nwhich the dead body had been laid, and sewed up the mouth of the sack\nfrom the inside.\n\nHe would have been discovered by the beating of his heart, if by any\nmischance the jailers had entered at that moment. Dantès might have\nwaited until the evening visit was over, but he was afraid that the\ngovernor would change his mind, and order the dead body to be removed\nearlier. In that case his last hope would have been destroyed.\n\nNow his plans were fully made, and this is what he intended to do. If\nwhile he was being carried out the grave-diggers should discover that\nthey were bearing a live instead of a dead body, Dantès did not intend\nto give them time to recognize him, but with a sudden cut of the knife,\nhe meant to open the sack from top to bottom, and, profiting by their\nalarm, escape; if they tried to catch him, he would use his knife to\nbetter purpose.\n\n0263m\n\n\n\nIf they took him to the cemetery and laid him in a grave, he would\nallow himself to be covered with earth, and then, as it was night, the\ngrave-diggers could scarcely have turned their backs before he would\nhave worked his way through the yielding soil and escaped. He hoped\nthat the weight of earth would not be so great that he could not\novercome it. If he was detected in this and the earth proved too heavy,\nhe would be stifled, and then—so much the better, all would be over.\n\nDantès had not eaten since the preceding evening, but he had not\nthought of hunger, nor did he think of it now. His situation was too\nprecarious to allow him even time to reflect on any thought but one.\n\nThe first risk that Dantès ran was, that the jailer, when he brought\nhim his supper at seven o’clock, mi"}]}

The slope was gradual, and the travelers had only to descend\na gentle declivity to the sea.\n\nWhen the Patagonian declined the horse that Glenarvan offered him, the\nlatter thought that he preferred to go on foot, according to the custom\nof certain guides; and indeed, his long legs ought to have made walking\neasy. But he was mistaken.\n\nAt the moment of departure Thalcave whistled in a peculiar manner.\nImmediately a magnificent Argentine horse, of superb form, issued from\na small wood near by, and approached at the call of his master. The\nanimal was perfectly beautiful. His brown color indicated a sound,\nspirited and courageous beast. He had a small and elegantly poised\nhead, widely opening nostrils, a fiery eye, large hams, swelling\nwithers, broad breast, long pasterns, in short, all the qualities that\nconstitute strength and suppleness. The major, like a perfect horseman,\nadmired unreservedly this specimen of the horses of the plains. This\nbeautiful creature was called Thaouka, which means \"bird\" in the\nPatagonian language, and he justly merited this appellation.\n\n[Sidenote: A FRESH START.]\n\nWhen Thalcave was in the saddle, the horse pranced with spirited grace,\nand the Patagonian, a skillful rider, was magnificent to behold. His\noutfit comprised two weapons of the chase, the \"bolas\" and the lasso.\nThe bolas consists of three balls tied together by a leathern string,\nwhich are fastened to the front of the saddle. The Indians frequently\nthrow them the distance of a hundred paces at the animal or enemy that\nthey are pursuing, and with such precision that they twist about their\nlegs and bring them to the ground. It is, therefore, in their hands a\nformidable instrument, and they handle it with surprising dexterity.\nThe lasso, on the contrary, does not leave the hand that wields it. It\nconsists simply of a leathern thong thirty feet in length, terminating\nin a slip-noose which works upon an iron ring. The right hand throws\nthe slip-noose, while the left hand holds the remainder of the lasso,\nthe end of which is firmly tied to the saddle. A long carbine in a\nsling completed the Patagonian's armament.\n\nThalcave, without observing the admiration caused by his natural\ngrace, ease and courage, took the lead, and the party advanced, now\nat a gallop, and now at a walk, for their horses seemed entirely\nunaccustomed to trotting. Robert mounted with much boldness, and\nspeedily convinced Glenarvan of his ability to keep his seat.\n\nOn issuing from the gorges of the Andes, they encountered a great\nnumber of sand-ridges, called \"medanos,\" real waves incessantly\nagitated by the wind, when the roots of the herbage did not confine\nthem to the earth. This sand is of an extreme fineness; and, at the\nleast breath, they saw it float away in light clouds, or form regular\nsand-columns which rose to a considerable height. This spectacle caused\npleasure as well as annoyance to the eyes. Pleasure, for nothing was\nmore curious than these columns, wandering over the plain, struggling,\nmingling, sinking and rising in inexpressible confusion; and annoyance,\nsince an impalpable dust emanated from these innumerable medanos and\npenetrated the eyelids, however tightly they were closed.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThis phenomenon continued during a great part of the day. Nevertheless,\nthey advanced rapidly, and towards six o'clock the A"}, {"chunk_id": 65, "text": "van, who was listening with intentness.\n\nBut Thalcave shook his head. He knew well that the animals would not\nabandon a certain prey until at daybreak they returned to their holes\nand dens.\n\nHowever, the tactics of their enemies had evidently changed, they no\nlonger endeavored to force the entrance of the ramada; but their new\nmanoeuvres were already causing a still more imminent danger.\n\nThe wolves, abandoning their design of penetrating the inclosure by\nthis entrance, which was defended by weapon and fire, went to the\nback of the ramada and sought to assail it in the rear. Their claws\nwere soon heard rattling against the half-decayed wood. Already their\npowerful paws and bloody mouths had forced their way between the\nshattered stakes. The horses, bewildered and panic-stricken, broke\ntheir halters and dashed into the inclosure. Glenarvan seized Robert\nin his arms, to defend him to the last extremity; and he would have\nattempted a rash flight, and rushed out of the ramada, had not his eyes\nfallen upon the Indian.\n\nThalcave, turning like a deer, had suddenly approached his horse,\nwhich was neighing with impatience, and was beginning to saddle him\ncarefully, forgetting neither strap nor buckle. He seemed no longer to\ncare for the howls, that were now redoubled. Glenarvan gazed at him\nwith a dark foreboding.\n\n\"He is leaving us!\" cried he, seeing Thalcave gather up his reins as\nthough he were about to mount.\n\n\"He? never!\" said Robert.\n\nIn truth the Indian was about to make a venture, not to leave his\nfriends, but to save them by sacrificing himself. Thaouka was ready.\nHe champed his bit; he pranced; his eyes, full of a fiery spirit, shot\nforth lightning flashes; he understood his master.\n\nJust as the Indian was seizing the mane of his horse, Glenarvan caught\nhim by the arm with a convulsive grasp.\n\n\"You are going?\" said he, pointing to the plain, which was now deserted.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the Indian, who comprehended the gesture of his\ncompanion; and, with vehement gesticulations which were however\nperfectly intelligible, he added a few words in Spanish, which\nsignified: \"Thaouka--good horse--swift--will draw the wolves after him.\"\n\n[Illustration: Frightful howls resounded. The wolves, starting on the\ntrack of the horse, fled into the darkness with a terrible speed.]\n\n\"Ha! Thalcave!\" cried Glenarvan.\n\n\"Quick, quick!\" continued the Indian; while Glenarvan said to Robert,\nin a voice broken by emotion,--\n\n\"Robert, my lad, you hear! He will sacrifice himself for us; he will\nrush out over the plain, and turn aside the fury of the wolves upon\nhimself.\"\n\n\"Friend Thalcave,\" replied Robert, looking imploringly at the\nPatagonian, \"friend Thalcave, do not leave us!\"\n\n\"No,\" said Glenarvan, \"he will not leave us.\"\n\nAnd, turning to the Indian, he added, pointing to the terrified horses\ncrowding against the stakes,--\n\n\"Let us go together.\"\n\n\"No,\" said the Indian, who was not mistaken as to the meaning of these\nwords. \"Bad beasts--frightened--Thaouka--good horse.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Glenarvan. \"Thalcave shall not leave, Robert. He\nshows me what I have to do. It is my duty to go, and his to remain with\nyou.\"\n\nThen, seizing Thaouka's bridle, he added,--\n\n\"I will go.\"\n\n\"No,\" replied the Patagonian, calmly.\n\n\"I tell you,\" cried Glenarvan, taking the bridle from the hands of the\nIndian, \"I will go. Save this boy! I trust him to you, Thalcave!\"\n\nGlenarvan, in his excitement, mingled English and Spanish together. But\nwhat matters the language? In such a terrible situation, signs tell\nall, and men quickly understand each other.\n\n[Sidenote: SAFETY FOR TWO.]\n\nHowever, Thalcave resisted, and the discussion was prolonged. The\ndanger was increasing every moment. Already the broken stakes were\nyielding to the teeth and claws of the wolves. But neither Glenarvan\nnor Thalcave appeared willing to yield. The Indian had drawn Glenarvan\ntowards the entrance of the inclosure. He pointed to the plain, now\nfree from wolves. In his animated language, he explained that not "}, {"chunk_id": 76, "text": "ormy. The sides of the rancho cracked as if they would\nbreak, while the frail structure bent beneath the gusts of wind and\nthreatened to give way at every shock. The unfortunate horses neighed\nin terror without, exposed to the inclemency of the tempest; and their\nmasters did not suffer less in their miserable shelter. However, sleep\ndrowned all their troubles at last. Robert first closed his eyes,\nreclining his head on Lord Glenarvan's shoulder; and soon all the\ninmates of the rancho slept under the protection of God.\n\nThey woke the next morning at the call of Thaouka, who, always ready,\nneighed without, and struck the wall of the hut vigorously with his\nhoof, as though to give the signal for departure. They owed him too\nmuch not to obey him, and they accordingly resumed their journey.\n\nThe rain had ceased, but the hard earth held what had fallen. On the\nimpenetrable clay, pools, marshes, and ponds overflowed and formed\nimmense \"bañados\" of treacherous depth. Paganel, on consulting his map,\njudged rightly that the Grande and Nivarota Rivers, into which the\nwaters of the plain usually flow, must have mingled together in one\nbroad stream.\n\nAn extremely rapid advance, therefore, became necessary. The common\nsafety was at stake. If the inundation increased, where could they find\na refuge? The vast circle of the horizon did not offer a single point,\nand on this level plain the progress of the water must be rapid. The\nhorses were urged to their utmost speed. Thaouka took the lead, and\nmight have borne the name of sea-horse, for he pranced as if he had\nbeen in his native element.\n\nSuddenly, about six o'clock in the evening, he manifested signs of\nextreme agitation. He turned frequently towards the vast expanse to the\nsouth; his neighs were prolonged, his nostrils keenly snuffed the air,\nand he reared violently. Thalcave, whom his antics could not unseat,\nmanaged his steed without difficulty. The froth from the horse's mouth\nwas mingled with blood under the action of the firmly-closed bit, and\nyet the spirited animal could not be calm. If free, his master felt but\ntoo well that he would have fled away at full speed towards the north.\n\n\"What is the matter with Thaouka?\" asked Paganel. \"Has he been bitten\nby those voracious blood-suckers of the Argentine waters?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied the Indian.\n\n\"Is he terrified, then, at some danger?\"\n\n\"Yes, he has scented danger.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"I do not know.\"\n\nAlthough the eye did not yet reveal the peril that Thaouka divined,\nthe ear could already detect it. A low murmur, like the sound of a\nrising tide, was heard as from the limit of the horizon. The wind blew\nin damp gusts laden with spray; the birds, as if fleeing from some\nunknown phenomenon, shot swiftly through the air; and the horses,\nwading to their knees, felt the first impulse of the current. Soon a\nmingled roar, like bellowing, neighing, and bleating, resounded half\na mile to the south, and immense herds appeared, tumbling, rising,\nand rushing, a confused mass of terrified beasts, and fled by with\nfrightful rapidity. It was scarcely possible to distinguish them in the\nmidst of the clouds of spray dashed up by their flight.\n\n[Illustration: \"The flood! the flood!\" replied Thalcave, spurring his\nhorse towards the north.]\n\n\"Quick! quick!\" cried Thalcave, in a piercing voice.\n\n\"What is it?\" said Paganel.\n\n\"The flood! the flood!\" replied Thalcave, spurring his horse towards\nthe north.\n\n\"The inundation!\" cried Paganel; and his companions, with him at their\nhead, fled away in the track of Thaouka.\n\nIt was time. Five miles to the south a high and broad wall of water\nwas rushing over the plain, which was fast becoming an ocean. The tall\ngrass disappeared as before the scythe, and the tufts of mimosas, torn\nup by the current, separated and formed floating islands. The mass of\nwaters spread itself in broad waves of irresistible power. The dikes of\nthe great rivers had evidently given way, and perhaps the waters of the\nColorado and Rio Negro were now mingling"}, {"chunk_id": 50, "text": "lt\nhis wounded limbs. Then, smiling, he went and gathered on the banks\nof the stream a few handfuls of wild celery, with which he rubbed the\nboy's body. Under this treatment, performed with an extreme gentleness,\nthe child felt his strength revive, and it was plain that a few hours\nwould suffice to restore him.\n\nIt was therefore decided that that day and the following night should\nbe passed at the encampment. Besides, two important questions remained\nto be settled--food, and means of conveyance. Provisions and mules were\nboth wanting.\n\nFortunately Thalcave solved the difficulty. This guide, who was\naccustomed to conduct travelers along the Patagonian frontiers, and\nwas one of the most intelligent baqueanos of the country, engaged to\nfurnish Glenarvan all that his little party needed. He offered to take\nhim to a \"tolderia\" (encampment) of Indians, about four miles distant,\nwhere they would find everything necessary for the expedition. This\nproposal was made partly by gestures, partly by Spanish words which\nPaganel succeeded in understanding. It was accepted, and Glenarvan and\nhis learned friend, taking leave of their companions, reascended the\nstream under the guidance of the Patagonian.\n\nThey proceeded at a good pace for an hour and a half, taking long\nstrides to keep up to the giant Thalcave. All the region was charming,\nand of a rich fertility. The grassy pastures succeeded each other,\nand could easily have fed thousands of cattle. Large ponds, united by\na winding chain of streams, gave these plains a verdant moisture.\nBlack-headed swans sported on the mirror-like surface, and disputed the\nempire of the waters with numberless ostriches that gamboled over the\nplains, while the brilliant feathered tribes were in wonderful variety.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nJacques Paganel proceeded from admiration to ecstasy. Exclamations\nof delight continually escaped his lips, to the astonishment of the\nPatagonian, who thought it very natural that there should be birds in\nthe air, swans on the lakes, and grass on the prairies. The geographer\nhad no reason to regret his walk, or complain of its length. He\nscarcely believed himself started, or that the encampment would soon\ncome in sight.\n\nThis tolderia was at the bottom of a narrow valley among the mountains.\nHere in huts of branches lived thirty wandering natives, grazing\nlarge herds of milch cows, sheep, cattle and horses. Thus they roamed\nfrom one pasture to another, always finding a repast ready for their\nfour-footed companions.\n\n[Sidenote: GLENARVAN GOING TO MARKET.]\n\nThalcave took upon himself the negotiation, which was not long. In\nreturn for seven small Argentine horses, all saddled, a hundred pounds\nof dried meat, a few measures of rice, and some leathern bottles for\nwater, the Indians received twenty ounces of gold, the value of which\nthey perfectly understood. Glenarvan would have bought another horse\nfor the Patagonian, but he intimated that it was unnecessary.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe bargain concluded, Glenarvan took leave of his new \"providers,\" as\nPaganel expressed it, and returned to the encampment.

The three\nhorses galloped briskly forward. These excellent beasts perceived,\ndoubtless, by instinct, whither their masters were guiding them.\nThaouka, especially, showed a spirit that neither fatigue nor thirst\ncould overcome. The other horses followed, at a slower pace, but\nincited by his example.\n\nThe Patagonian frequently turned his head to look at Robert Grant, and,\nseeing the young boy firm and erect, in an easy and graceful position,\ntestified his satisfaction by a word of encouragement.\n\n\"Bravo, Robert!\" said Glenarvan. \"Thalcave seems to congratulate you.\nHe praises you, my boy!\"\n\n\"And why, my lord?\"\n\n\"Because of the way you ride.\"\n\n\"Oh, I merely keep firm; that is all,\" replied Robert, who blushed with\npleasure at hearing himself complimented.\n\n\"That is the main point, Robert,\" said Glenarvan; \"but you are too\nmodest, and I am sure you cannot fail to become an accomplished\nequestrian.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Robert, \"but what will papa say, who wishes to make a\nsailor of me?\"\n\n\"The one does not interfere with the other. If all horsemen do not make\ngood sailors, all sailors may certainly make good horsemen. To ride on\nthe yards, you must learn to keep yourself firm. As for knowing how to\nmanage your horse, that comes more easily.\"\n\n\"Poor father!\" exclaimed Robert; \"how he will thank you when you have\nfound him!\" And, so saying, he took his lordship's hand and pressed it\nto his lips.\n\n\"You love him well, Robert?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord; he was so kind to sister and me. He thought only of us,\nand every voyage brought us a memento of the countries he visited, and,\nwhat was better, tender caresses and kind words, on his return. Ah!\nyou will love him too, when you know him! Mary resembles him. He has a\nsweet voice like her. It is singular for a sailor, is it not?\"\n\n\"Yes, very singular, Robert,\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\"I see him still,\" replied the boy, as if speaking to himself. \"Good\nand brave papa! He rocked me to sleep on his knees, when I was little,\nand kept humming an old Scottish song which is sung around the lakes of\nour country. I sometimes recall the air, but indistinctly. How we loved\nhim, my lord! Well, I think one must be very young to love his father\nwell.\"\n\n\"And old to reverence him, my child,\" replied Glenarvan, quite moved by\nthe words that came from this young heart.\n\nDuring this conversation, their horses had relaxed their pace and\nfallen behind the other; but Thalcave called them, and they resumed\ntheir former gait. It was soon evident, however, that, with the\nexception of Thaouka, the horses could not long maintain this speed. At\nnoon it was necessary to give them an hour's rest.\n\nGlenarvan grew uneasy. The signs of dryness did not diminish, and the\nwant of water might result in disastrous consequences. Thalcave said\nnothing, but probably thought that if the Guamini was dry it would then\nbe time to despair, if indeed an Indian's heart has ever experienced\nsuch an emotion.\n\nThey therefore kept on, and by use of whip and spur the horses were\ninduced to continue their journey, but they could not quicken their\npace. Thalcave might easily have gone ahead, for in a few hours Thaouka\ncould have carried him to the banks of the stream. He doubtless thought\nof it, but probably did not like to leave his two companions alone in\nthe midst of this desert, and, that he might not outstrip them, he\nforced Thaouka to lessen his speed. It was not, however, without much\nresistance, prancing and neighing, that Thalcave's horse consented to\nkeep pace with the others. It was not so much the strength as the voice\nof his master which restrained him; the Indian actually talked to his\nhorse; and the animal, if he did not answer, at least comprehended\nhim. The Patagonian must have used excellent arguments, for, after\n\"discussing\" some time,"}]}

But this is scarcely probable, especially if we play our part\nskillfully.\"\n\n\"And when shall we make this last venture?\" asked Lady Helena.\n\n\"This very evening,\" answered Paganel, \"at the hour of the greatest\ndarkness.\"\n\n\"Agreed,\" said MacNabb. \"Paganel, you are a man of genius; and although\nfrom habit I am scarcely ever enthusiastic, I will answer for your\nsuccess. Ha! these rascals! we shall perform a little miracle for them\nthat will delay their conversion a good century. May the missionaries\npardon us!\"\n\nPaganel's plan was therefore adopted, and really, with the\nsuperstitious notions of the Maoris, it might and ought to succeed.\nIt only remained to execute it. The idea was good, but in practice\ndifficult. Might not this volcano consume the audacious ones who should\ndig the crater? Could they control and direct this eruption when the\nvapors, flames, and lava should be let loose? Would it not engulf\nthe entire peak in a flood of fire? They were tampering with those\nphenomena whose absolute control is reserved for forces higher than\ntheirs.\n\nPaganel had foreseen these difficulties, but he expected to act\nprudently, and not to venture to extremes. An illusion was enough to\ndeceive the Maoris, without the awful reality of a large eruption.\n\nHow long that day seemed! Each one counted the interminable hours.\nEverything was prepared for flight. The provisions of the tomb had\nbeen divided, and made into convenient bundles. Several mats, and the\nfire-arms, which had been found in the tomb of the chief, formed light\nbaggage. Of course these preparations were made within the palisaded\ninclosure and unknown to the savages.\n\nAt six o'clock the steward served a farewell feast. Where and when they\nshould eat in the valleys no one could foretell.\n\nTwilight came on. The sun disappeared behind a bank of dense clouds of\nthreatening aspect. A few flashes illumined the horizon, and a distant\npeal of thunder rumbled along the vault of the sky. Paganel welcomed\nthe storm that came to the aid of his design.\n\nAt eight o'clock the summit of the mountain was hidden by a foreboding\ndarkness, while the sky looked terribly black, as if for a background\nto the flaming outbreak that Paganel was about to inaugurate. The\nMaoris could no longer see their prisoners. The time for action had\ncome. Rapidity was necessary, and Glenarvan, Paganel, MacNabb, Robert,\nthe steward, and the two sailors at once set to work vigorously.\n\nThe place for the crater was chosen thirty paces from Kara-Tété's tomb.\nIt was important that this structure should be spared by the eruption,\nfor otherwise the taboo would become ineffective. Paganel had observed\nan enormous block of stone, around which the vapors seemed to pour\nforth with considerable force. This rocky mass covered a small natural\ncrater in the peak, and only by its weight prevented the escape of the\nsubterranean flames. If they could succeed in overturning it, the smoke\nand lava would immediately issue through the unobstructed opening.\n\n[Sidenote: VULCANS AT WORK.]\n\nThe fugitives made themselves levers out of the stakes of the tomb, and\nwith these they vigorously attacked the ponderous mass. Under their\nunited efforts the rock was not long in moving. They dug a sort of\ngroove for it down the side of the mountain, that it might slide on an\ninclined plane.\n\nAs their action increased, the trembling of the earth became more\nviolent. Hollow rumblings and hissings sounded under the thin\ncrust. But the bold experimenters, like real Vulcans, governing the\nunderground fires, worked on in silence. Several cracks and a few gusts\nof hot smoke warned them that their position was becoming dangerous.\nBut a final effort detached the block, which gli"}, {"chunk_id": 62, "text": "arvan, Robert, and Thalcave had yielded to the common law, and,\nstretched on their thick beds of grass, they enjoyed a refreshing\nsleep. The horses, overcome with fatigue, had lain down on the ground:\nThaouka alone, like a true blooded horse, slept standing, spirited in\nrepose as in action, and ready to start at the least sign from his\nmaster. Perfect tranquillity reigned within the inclosure, and the\nembers of the night-fire, as they gradually died out, cast their last\nrays over the silent obscurity.\n\nAbout ten o'clock, after a short sleep, the Indian awoke. His eyes\nbecame fixed beneath his lowered eyebrows, and his head was turned in a\nlistening attitude towards the plain. He seemed endeavoring to detect\nsome scarcely perceptible sound. A vague uneasiness was soon expressed\non his face, usually so calm. Had he perceived the approach of prowling\nIndians, or the coming of jaguars, water-tigers, and other formidable\nbeasts which are numerous in the neighborhood of rivers? This last\npossibility doubtless appeared plausible to him, for he cast a rapid\nglance over the combustible materials piled in the inclosure, and his\nanxiety increased. In fact, all this dry bedding would quickly be\nconsumed, and could not long intimidate the audacious animals.\n\nAccording to this conjecture, Thalcave had only to await the progress\nof events, which he did, half reclining, his head resting on his hands,\nhis elbows on his knees, his eyes motionless, in the attitude of a man\nwhom a sudden anxiety has awakened from sleep.\n\nAn hour passed. Any other person but Thalcave, reassured by the outward\nsilence, would have lain down again. But where a stranger would have\nsuspected nothing, the highly-trained senses and natural instinct of\nthe Indian foresaw the coming danger.\n\nWhile he was listening and watching, Thaouka gave a low neigh. His\nnose was stretched towards the entrance to the ramada. The Patagonian\nsuddenly started.\n\n\"Thaouka has scented some enemy,\" said he.\n\nHe arose and scanned the plain attentively. Silence still reigned, but\nnot tranquillity. Thalcave discerned shadows moving noiselessly among\nthe tufts of grass. Here and there glittered luminous points, which\nspread on all sides, now fading away, and now gleaming forth again. You\nwould have thought fantastic elves were dancing on the surface of an\nimmense lagoon. A stranger would doubtless have taken these flitting\nsparks for glow-worms, which shine, when night comes, in many parts of\nthe Pampas. But Thalcave was not deceived; he knew with what enemies he\nhad to deal. He loaded his carbine, and took a position near the first\nstakes of the inclosure.\n\nHe did not wait long. A strange cry, a mingling of barks and howls,\nresounded over the plain. The report of the carbine answered it,\nand was followed by a hundred frightful yelps. Glenarvan and Robert\nsuddenly awoke.\n\n[Sidenote: FEARFUL ODDS.]\n\n\"What is the matter?\" asked Robert.\n\n\"Indians?\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\"No,\" replied Thalcave, \"aguaras.\"\n\nRobert looked at Glenarvan.\n\n\"Aguaras?\" said he.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Glenarvan, \"the red wolves of the Pampas.\"\n\nBoth seized their weapons, and joined the Indian. The latter pointed\nto the plain, from which arose a series of formidable howls. Robert\ninvoluntarily took a step backward.\n\n\"You are not afraid of the wolves, my boy?\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\"No, my lord,\" replied Robert, in a firm tone. \"With you I fear\nnothing.\"\n\n\"So much the better. These aguaras are not very formidable beasts; and\nwere it not for their numbers I should not even think of them.\"\n\n\"What does it matter?\" replied Robert. \"We are well armed. Let them\ncome.\"\n\n\"And they shall be well received.\"\n\nSpeaking thus, Glenarvan endeavored to reassure the lad; but he did\nnot think without a secret terror of that dense horde of exasperated\nbeasts. Perhaps there were hundreds of them; and these three, however\nwell armed, could not advantageously contend against so many and such\nantagonists.\n\nBy the howls that resounded over the Pampas, and by the multi"}, {"chunk_id": 60, "text": "dst of this desert, and, that he might not outstrip them, he\nforced Thaouka to lessen his speed. It was not, however, without much\nresistance, prancing and neighing, that Thalcave's horse consented to\nkeep pace with the others. It was not so much the strength as the voice\nof his master which restrained him; the Indian actually talked to his\nhorse; and the animal, if he did not answer, at least comprehended\nhim. The Patagonian must have used excellent arguments, for, after\n\"discussing\" some time, Thaouka yielded, and obeyed his master's\ncommands.\n\n[Sidenote: GAINED AT LAST.]\n\nBut, if Thaouka understood Thalcave, Thalcave had none the less\nunderstood Thaouka. The intelligent animal, through his superior\ninstincts, had perceived a moisture in the air. He inhaled it eagerly,\nand kept moving his tongue, as if it were steeped in a grateful liquid.\nThe Patagonian could not be deceived; water was not far distant.\n\nHe therefore encouraged his companions by explaining the impatience of\nhis horse, which the others were not long in understanding. They made a\nfinal effort, and galloped after the Indian.\n\nAbout three o'clock a bright line appeared in a hollow of the plain. It\ntrembled under the rays of the sun.\n\n\"Water!\" cried Glenarvan.\n\n\"Water, yes, water!\" cried Robert.\n\nThey had no more need to urge their horses. The poor beasts, feeling\ntheir strength renewed, rushed forward with an irresistible eagerness.\nIn a few moments they had reached the Guamini River, and, saddled as\nthey were, plunged to their breasts into the cooling stream. Their\nmasters imitated their example, without reluctance, and took an\nafternoon bath which was as healthful as it was pleasant.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Ah, how good it is!\" said Robert, as he quenched his thirst in the\nmiddle of the river.\n\n\"Be moderate, my boy,\" said Glenarvan, who did not set a good example.\n\nNothing was heard but the sound of rapid drinking. As for Thalcave,\nhe drank quietly, without hurrying, long and deeply, till they might\nperhaps fear that the stream would be drained.\n\n\"Well,\" said Glenarvan, \"our friends will not be disappointed in their\nexpectations. They are sure, on arriving at the Guamini, to find an\nabundance of clear water, if Thalcave leaves any!\"\n\n\"But could we not go to meet them?\" asked Robert. \"We could spare them\nseveral hours of anxiety.\"\n\n\"Doubtless, my boy; but how carry the water? Wilson has charge of the\nwater-bottles. No, it is better to wait, as we agreed. Calculating the\nnecessary time, and the slow pace of the horses, our friends will be\nhere at night. Let us, then, prepare them a safe shelter and a good\nrepast.\"\n\nThalcave had not waited for Glenarvan's orders to search for a place\nto encamp. He had very fortunately found on the banks of the river a\n\"ramada,\" a kind of inclosure designed for a cattle-fold and shut in\non three sides. The situation was excellent for the purpose, so long\nas one did not fear to sleep in the open air; and that was the least\nanxiety of Thalcave's companions. Thus they did not seek a better\nretreat, but stretched themselves on the ground in the sun to dry their\nwater-soaked garments.\n\n\"Well, since here is shelter,\" said Glenarvan, \"let us think of supper.\nOur friends must be satisfied with the couriers whom they have sent\nforward; and, if I am not greatly mistaken, they will have no reason\nto complain. I think an hour's hunting will not be time lost. Are you\nready, Robert?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord,\" replied he, with gun in hand.\n\n[Sidenote: AN EVENING'S SPORT.]\n\nGlenarvan had conceived this idea because the banks of the Guamini\nseemed to be the haunt of the game of the surrounding plains.\n\"Tinamous,\" a kind of partridge, plovers called \"teru-teru,\" yellow\nrails, and water-fowl of magnificent green were seen rising in flocks.\nAs for quadrupeds, they did not make their appearance; but Thalcave,\npointing to the tall grass and thick coppice, explained that they\nwere hidden there. The hunters had only to take a few steps to find\nthemselves in one of the "}, {"chunk_id": 190, "text": "des,\nfifteen feet high. A second line of stakes, and then a fence of osiers,\npierced with loop-holes, inclosed the inner space, the court-yard of\nthe pah, in which stood several Maori tents, and forty huts which were\nsymmetrically arranged.\n\nOn their arrival, the captives were terribly impressed at sight of\nthe heads that ornamented the stakes of the second inclosure. Lady\nHelena and Mary Grant turned away their eyes with more of disgust than\nterror. These heads had most of them belonged to hostile chiefs, fallen\nin battle, whose bodies had served as food for the conquerors. The\ngeographer knew them to be such by their hollow and eyeless sockets!\n\nIn Kai-Koumou's pah only the heads of his enemies formed this frightful\nmuseum; and here, doubtless, more than one English skull had served to\nincrease the size of the chief's collection.\n\nHis hut, among those belonging to warriors of lower rank, stood at the\nrear of the pah, in front of a large open terrace. This structure was\nbuilt of stakes, interlaced with branches, and lined inside with flax\nmatting.\n\nOnly one opening gave access to the dwelling. A thick curtain, made\nof a vegetable tissue, served as a door. The roof projected so as to\nform a water-shed. Several faces, carved at the ends of the rafters,\nadorned the hut, and the curtain was covered with various imitations\nof foliage, symbolical figures, monsters, and graceful sculpturing,\na curious piece of work, fashioned by the scissors of the native\ndecorators.\n\n[Sidenote: FEMININE ORATORY.]\n\nInside of the habitation the floor was made of hard-trodden earth,\nand raised six inches above the ground. Several rush screens and some\nmattresses, covered with woven matting of long leaves and twigs,\nserved as beds. In the middle of the room a hole in a stone formed the\nfireplace, and another in the roof answered for a chimney.\n\nThe smoke, when it became sufficiently thick, perforce escaped at this\noutlet, but it of course blackened the walls of the house.\n\nOn one side of the hut were storehouses, containing the chief's\nprovisions, his harvest of flax, potatoes, and edible ferns, and\nthe ovens where the various articles of food were cooked by contact\nwith heated stones. Farther off, in small pens, pigs and goats were\nconfined, and dogs ran about seeking their scanty sustenance. They were\nrather poorly kept, for animals that formed the Maori daily food.\n\nGlenarvan and his companions had taken in the whole at a glance. They\nawaited beside an empty hut the good pleasure of the chief, exposed to\nthe insults of a crowd of old women, who surrounded them like harpies,\nand threatened them with their fists, crying and howling. Several\nEnglish words that passed their lips clearly indicated that they were\ndemanding immediate vengeance.\n\nIn the midst of these cries and threats, Lady Helena affected a\ncalmness that she could not feel in her heart. This courageous woman,\nin order that her husband's coolness might not forsake him, heroically\ncontrolled her emotions. Poor Mary Grant felt herself growing weak, and\nCaptain Mangles supported her, ready to die in her defence. The others\nendured this torrent of invectives in various ways, either indifferent\nlike the major, or increasingly annoyed like Paganel.\n\nGlenarvan, wishing to relieve Lady Helena from the assaults of these\nshrews, boldly approached Kai-Koumou, and, pointing to the hideous\nthrong, said:\n\n\"Drive them away!\"\n\nThe Maori chief gazed steadily at his prisoner without replying. Then\nwith a gesture he silenced the noisy horde. Glenarvan bowed in token of\nthanks, and slowly resumed his place among his friends.\n\nKai-Koumou, fearing an insurrection of the fanatics of his tribe, now\nled his captives to a sacred place, situated at the other end of the\npah, on the edge of a precipice. This hut rested against a rock that\nrose a hundred feet above it and was a steep boundary to this side of\nthe fortification.

I am in a\nhurry to begin. I want to learn.”\n\n“Everything,” said the abbé. And that very evening the prisoners\nsketched a plan of education, to be entered upon the following day.\nDantès possessed a prodigious memory, combined with an astonishing\nquickness and readiness of conception; the mathematical turn of his\nmind rendered him apt at all kinds of calculation, while his naturally\npoetical feelings threw a light and pleasing veil over the dry reality\nof arithmetical computation, or the rigid severity of geometry. He\nalready knew Italian, and had also picked up a little of the Romaic\ndialect during voyages to the East; and by the aid of these two\nlanguages he easily comprehended the construction of all the others, so\nthat at the end of six months he began to speak Spanish, English, and\nGerman.\n\nIn strict accordance with the promise made to the abbé, Dantès spoke no\nmore of escape. Perhaps the delight his studies afforded him left no\nroom for such thoughts; perhaps the recollection that he had pledged\nhis word (on which his sense of honor was keen) kept him from referring\nin any way to the possibilities of flight. Days, even months, passed by\nunheeded in one rapid and instructive course. At the end of a year\nDantès was a new man. Dantès observed, however, that Faria, in spite of\nthe relief his society afforded, daily grew sadder; one thought seemed\nincessantly to harass and distract his mind. Sometimes he would fall\ninto long reveries, sigh heavily and involuntarily, then suddenly rise,\nand, with folded arms, begin pacing the confined space of his dungeon.\nOne day he stopped all at once, and exclaimed:\n\n“Ah, if there were no sentinel!”\n\n“There shall not be one a minute longer than you please,” said Dantès,\nwho had followed the working of his thoughts as accurately as though\nhis brain were enclosed in crystal so clear as to display its minutest\noperations.\n\n“I have already told you,” answered the abbé, “that I loathe the idea\nof shedding blood.”\n\n“And yet the murder, if you choose to call it so, would be simply a\nmeasure of self-preservation.”\n\n“No matter! I could never agree to it.”\n\n“Still, you have thought of it?”\n\n“Incessantly, alas!” cried the abbé.\n\n“And you have discovered a means of regaining our freedom, have you\nnot?” asked Dantès eagerly.\n\n“I have; if it were only possible to place a deaf and blind sentinel in\nthe gallery beyond us.”\n\n“He shall be both blind and deaf,” replied the young man, with an air\nof determination that made his companion shudder.\n\n“No, no,” cried the abbé; “impossible!”\n\nDantès endeavored to renew the subject; the abbé shook his head in\ntoken of disapproval, and refused to make any further response. Three\nmonths passed away.\n\n“Are you strong?” the abbé asked one day of Dantès. The young man, in\nreply, took up the chisel, bent it into the form of a horseshoe, and\nthen as readily straightened it.\n\n“And will you engage not to do any harm to the sentry, except as a last\nresort?”\n\n“I promise on my honor.”\n\n“Then,” said the abbé, “we may hope to put our design into execution.”\n\n“And how long shall we be in accomplishing the necessary work?”\n\n“At least a year.”\n\n“And shall we begin at once?”\n\n“At once.”\n\n“We have lost a year to no purpose!” cried Dantès.\n\n“Do you consider the last twelve months to have been wasted?” asked the\nabbé.\n\n“Forgive me!” cried Edmond, blushing deeply.\n\n“Tut, tut!” answered the abbé, “man is but man after all, and you are\nabout the best specimen of the genus I have ever known.

At\nthe end of three months he had learned to read. This was not enough—he\nmust now learn to write. The priest had a writing teacher at Rome make\nthree alphabets—one large, one middling, and one small; and pointed out\nto him that by the help of a sharp instrument he could trace the\nletters on a slate, and thus learn to write. The same evening, when the\nflock was safe at the farm, the little Luigi hastened to the smith at\nPalestrina, took a large nail, heated and sharpened it, and formed a\nsort of stylus. The next morning he gathered an armful of pieces of\nslate and began. At the end of three months he had learned to write.\nThe curate, astonished at his quickness and intelligence, made him a\npresent of pens, paper, and a penknife. This demanded new effort, but\nnothing compared to the first; at the end of a week he wrote as well\nwith this pen as with the stylus. The curate related the incident to\nthe Count of San-Felice, who sent for the little shepherd, made him\nread and write before him, ordered his attendant to let him eat with\nthe domestics, and to give him two piastres a month. With this, Luigi\npurchased books and pencils. He applied his imitative powers to\neverything, and, like Giotto, when young, he drew on his slate sheep,\nhouses, and trees. Then, with his knife, he began to carve all sorts of\nobjects in wood; it was thus that Pinelli, the famous sculptor, had\ncommenced.\n\n20105m\n\n\n\n“A girl of six or seven—that is, a little younger than Vampa—tended\nsheep on a farm near Palestrina; she was an orphan, born at Valmontone\nand was named Teresa. The two children met, sat down near each other,\nlet their flocks mingle together, played, laughed, and conversed\ntogether; in the evening they separated the Count of San-Felice’s flock\nfrom those of Baron Cervetri, and the children returned to their\nrespective farms, promising to meet the next morning. The next day they\nkept their word, and thus they grew up together. Vampa was twelve, and\nTeresa eleven. And yet their natural disposition revealed itself.\nBeside his taste for the fine arts, which Luigi had carried as far as\nhe could in his solitude, he was given to alternating fits of sadness\nand enthusiasm, was often angry and capricious, and always sarcastic.\nNone of the lads of Pampinara, Palestrina, or Valmontone had been able\nto gain any influence over him or even to become his companion. His\ndisposition (always inclined to exact concessions rather than to make\nthem) kept him aloof from all friendships. Teresa alone ruled by a\nlook, a word, a gesture, this impetuous character, which yielded\nbeneath the hand of a woman, and which beneath the hand of a man might\nhave broken, but could never have been bended. Teresa was lively and\ngay, but coquettish to excess. The two piastres that Luigi received\nevery month from the Count of San-Felice’s steward, and the price of\nall the little carvings in wood he sold at Rome, were expended in\near-rings, necklaces, and gold hairpins. So that, thanks to her\nfriend’s generosity, Teresa was the most beautiful and the best-attired\npeasant near Rome.\n\n“The two children grew up together, passing all their time with each\nother, and giving themselves up to the wild ideas of their different\ncharacters. Thus, in all their dreams, their wishes, and their\nconversations, Vampa saw himself the captain of a vessel, general of an\narmy, or governor of a province. Teresa saw herself rich, superbly\nattired, and attended by a train of liveried domestics. Then, when they\nhad thus passed the day in building castles in the air, they separated\ntheir flocks, and descended from the elevation of their dreams to the\nreality of their humble position.\n\n“One day the young shepherd told the count’s steward that he had seen a\nwolf come out of the Sabine mountains, and prowl ar"}, {"chunk_id": 102, "text": "I tried by absolute devotion to his will, to make up to him all\nhe had done for me during ten years of unremitting kindness. The\ncardinal’s house had no secrets for me. I had often seen my noble\npatron annotating ancient volumes, and eagerly searching amongst dusty\nfamily manuscripts. One day when I was reproaching him for his\nunavailing searches, and deploring the prostration of mind that\nfollowed them, he looked at me, and, smiling bitterly, opened a volume\nrelating to the History of the City of Rome. There, in the twentieth\nchapter of the Life of Pope Alexander VI., were the following lines,\nwhich I can never forget:—\n\n“‘The great wars of Romagna had ended; Cæsar Borgia, who had completed\nhis conquest, had need of money to purchase all Italy. The pope had\nalso need of money to bring matters to an end with Louis XII. King of\nFrance, who was formidable still in spite of his recent reverses; and\nit was necessary, therefore, to have recourse to some profitable\nscheme, which was a matter of great difficulty in the impoverished\ncondition of exhausted Italy. His holiness had an idea. He determined\nto make two cardinals.’\n\n“By choosing two of the greatest personages of Rome, especially rich\nmen—_this_ was the return the Holy Father looked for. In the first\nplace, he could sell the great appointments and splendid offices which\nthe cardinals already held; and then he had the two hats to sell\nbesides. There was a third point in view, which will appear hereafter.\n\n“The pope and Cæsar Borgia first found the two future cardinals; they\nwere Giovanni Rospigliosi, who held four of the highest dignities of\nthe Holy See, and Cæsar Spada, one of the noblest and richest of the\nRoman nobility; both felt the high honor of such a favor from the pope.\nThey were ambitious, and Cæsar Borgia soon found purchasers for their\nappointments. The result was, that Rospigliosi and Spada paid for being\ncardinals, and eight other persons paid for the offices the cardinals\nheld before their elevation, and thus eight hundred thousand crowns\nentered into the coffers of the speculators.\n\n0239m\n\n\n\n“It is time now to proceed to the last part of the speculation. The\npope heaped attentions upon Rospigliosi and Spada, conferred upon them\nthe insignia of the cardinalate, and induced them to arrange their\naffairs and take up their residence at Rome. Then the pope and Cæsar\nBorgia invited the two cardinals to dinner. This was a matter of\ndispute between the Holy Father and his son. Cæsar thought they could\nmake use of one of the means which he always had ready for his friends,\nthat is to say, in the first place, the famous key which was given to\ncertain persons with the request that they go and open a designated\ncupboard. This key was furnished with a small iron point,—a negligence\non the part of the locksmith. When this was pressed to effect the\nopening of the cupboard, of which the lock was difficult, the person\nwas pricked by this small point, and died next day. Then there was the\nring with the lion’s head, which Cæsar wore when he wanted to greet his\nfriends with a clasp of the hand. The lion bit the hand thus favored,\nand at the end of twenty-four hours, the bite was mortal.\n\n“Cæsar proposed to his father, that they should either ask the\ncardinals to open the cupboard, or shake hands with them; but Alexander\nVI. replied: ‘Now as to the worthy cardinals, Spada and Rospigliosi,\nlet us ask both of them to dinner, something tells me that we shall get\nthat money back. Besides, you forget, Cæsar, an indigestion declares\nitself immediately, while a prick or a bite occasions a delay of a day\nor two.’ Cæsar gave way before such cogent reasoning, and the cardinals\nwere consequently invited to dinner.\n\n“The table was laid in a vineyard belonging to the pope, near San\nPierdarena, a charming retreat which the cardinals knew very well by\nreport. Rospigliosi, quite set up with his new dignities, went with a\ngood appetite and his most ingratiating manner.

I\ndevoted three years of my life to reading and studying these one\nhundred and fifty volumes, till I knew them nearly by heart; so that\nsince I have been in prison, a very slight effort of memory has enabled\nme to recall their contents as readily as though the pages were open\nbefore me. I could recite you the whole of Thucydides, Xenophon,\nPlutarch, Titus Livius, Tacitus, Strada, Jornandes, Dante, Montaigne,\nShakespeare, Spinoza, Machiavelli, and Bossuet.

I know nearly one thousand words, which is all that is\nabsolutely necessary, although I believe there are nearly one hundred\nthousand in the dictionaries. I cannot hope to be very fluent, but I\ncertainly should have no difficulty in explaining my wants and wishes;\nand that would be quite as much as I should ever require.”\n\nStronger grew the wonder of Dantès, who almost fancied he had to do\nwith one gifted with supernatural powers; still hoping to find some\nimperfection which might bring him down to a level with human beings,\nhe added, “Then if you were not furnished with pens, how did you manage\nto write the work you speak of?”\n\n“I made myself some excellent ones, which would be universally\npreferred to all others if once known.

Had stolen away this child, in order that your name might\nbecome extinct.”\n\n“That is reasonable, since he is an only son.”\n\n“Well, now that all is arranged, do not let these newly awakened\nremembrances be forgotten. You have, doubtless, already guessed that I\nwas preparing a surprise for you?”\n\n“An agreeable one?” asked the Italian.\n\n“Ah, I see the eye of a father is no more to be deceived than his\nheart.”\n\n“Hum!” said the major.\n\n“Someone has told you the secret; or, perhaps, you guessed that he was\nhere.”\n\n“That who was here?”\n\n“Your child—your son—your Andrea!”\n\n“I did guess it,” replied the major with the greatest possible\ncoolness. “Then he is here?”\n\n“He is,” said Monte Cristo; “when the valet de chambre came in just\nnow, he told me of his arrival.”\n\n“Ah, very well, very well,” said the major, clutching the buttons of\nhis coat at each exclamation.\n\n“My dear sir,” said Monte Cristo, “I understand your emotion; you must\nhave time to recover yourself. I will, in the meantime, go and prepare\nthe young man for this much-desired interview, for I presume that he is\nnot less impatient for it than yourself.”\n\n“I should quite imagine that to be the case,” said Cavalcanti.\n\n“Well, in a quarter of an hour he shall be with you.”\n\n“You will bring him, then? You carry your goodness so far as even to\npresent him to me yourself?”\n\n“No; I do not wish to come between a father and son. Your interview\nwill be private. But do not be uneasy; even if the powerful voice of\nnature should be silent, you cannot well mistake him; he will enter by\nthis door. He is a fine young man, of fair complexion—a little too\nfair, perhaps—pleasing in manners; but you will see and judge for\nyourself.”\n\n“By the way,” said the major, “you know I have only the 2,000 francs\nwhich the Abbé Busoni sent me; this sum I have expended upon travelling\nexpenses, and——”\n\n“And you want money; that is a matter of course, my dear M. Cavalcanti.\nWell, here are 8,000 francs on account.”\n\nThe major’s eyes sparkled brilliantly.\n\n“It is 40,000 francs which I now owe you,” said Monte Cristo.\n\n“Does your excellency wish for a receipt?” said the major, at the same\ntime slipping the money into the inner pocket of his coat.\n\n“For what?” said the count.\n\n“I thought you might want it to show the Abbé Busoni.”\n\n“Well, when you receive the remaining 40,000, you shall give me a\nreceipt in full. Between honest men such excessive precaution is, I\nthink, quite unnecessary.”\n\n“Yes, so it is, between perfectly upright people.”\n\n“One word more,” said Monte Cristo.\n\n“Say on.”\n\n“You will permit me to make one remark?”\n\n“Certainly; pray do so.”\n\n“Then I should advise you to leave off wearing that style of dress.”\n\n“Indeed,” said the major, regarding himself with an air of complete\nsatisfaction.\n\n“Yes. It may be worn at Via Reggio; but that costume, however elegant\nin itself, has long been out of fashion in Paris.”\n\n“That’s unfortunate.”\n\n“Oh, if you really are attached to your old mode of dress; you can\neasily resume it when you leave Paris.”\n\n“But what shall I wear?”\n\n“What you find in your trunks.”\n\n“In my trunks? I have but one portmanteau.”\n\n“I dare say you have nothing else with you. What is the use of boring\none’s self with so many things? Besides an old soldier always likes to\nmarch with as little baggage as possible.”\n\n“That is just the case—precisely so.”\n\n“But you are a man of foresight and prudence, therefore you sent your\nluggage on before you. It has arrived at the Hôtel des Princes, Rue de\nRichelieu.

Still one place where\nthe grass was thin attracted my attention; it evidently was there I had\nturned up the ground. I went to work. The hour, then, for which I had\nbeen waiting during the last year had at length arrived. How I worked,\nhow I hoped, how I struck every piece of turf, thinking to find some\nresistance to my spade! But no, I found nothing, though I had made a\nhole twice as large as the first. I thought I had been deceived—had\nmistaken the spot. I turned around, I looked at the trees, I tried to\nrecall the details which had struck me at the time. A cold, sharp wind\nwhistled through the leafless branches, and yet the drops fell from my\nforehead. I recollected that I was stabbed just as I was trampling the\nground to fill up the hole; while doing so I had leaned against a\nlaburnum; behind me was an artificial rockery, intended to serve as a\nresting-place for persons walking in the garden; in falling, my hand,\nrelaxing its hold of the laburnum, felt the coldness of the stone. On\nmy right I saw the tree, behind me the rock. I stood in the same\nattitude, and threw myself down. I rose, and again began digging and\nenlarging the hole; still I found nothing, nothing—the chest was no\nlonger there!”\n\n30269m\n\n\n\n“The chest no longer there?” murmured Madame Danglars, choking with\nfear.\n\n“Think not I contented myself with this one effort,” continued\nVillefort. “No; I searched the whole thicket. I thought the assassin,\nhaving discovered the chest, and supposing it to be a treasure, had\nintended carrying it off, but, perceiving his error, had dug another\nhole, and deposited it there; but I could find nothing. Then the idea\nstruck me that he had not taken these precautions, and had simply\nthrown it in a corner. In the last case I must wait for daylight to\nrenew my search. I remained in the room and waited.”\n\n“Oh, Heaven!”\n\n30271m\n\n\n\nWhen daylight dawned I went down again. My first visit was to the\nthicket. I hoped to find some traces which had escaped me in the\ndarkness. I had turned up the earth over a surface of more than twenty\nfeet square, and a depth of two feet. A laborer would not have done in\na day what occupied me an hour. But I could find nothing—absolutely\nnothing. Then I renewed the search. Supposing it had been thrown aside,\nit would probably be on the path which led to the little gate; but this\nexamination was as useless as the first, and with a bursting heart I\nreturned to the thicket, which now contained no hope for me.”\n\n“Oh,” cried Madame Danglars, “it was enough to drive you mad!”\n\n“I hoped for a moment that it might,” said Villefort; “but that\nhappiness was denied me. However, recovering my strength and my ideas,\n‘Why,’ said I, ‘should that man have carried away the corpse?’”\n\n“But you said,” replied Madame Danglars, “he would require it as a\nproof.”\n\n“Ah, no, madame, that could not be. Dead bodies are not kept a year;\nthey are shown to a magistrate, and the evidence is taken. Now, nothing\nof the kind has happened.”\n\n“What then?” asked Hermine, trembling violently.\n\n“Something more terrible, more fatal, more alarming for us—the child\nwas, perhaps, alive, and the assassin may have saved it!”\n\nMadame Danglars uttered a piercing cry, and, seizing Villefort’s hands,\nexclaimed, “My child was alive?” said she; “you buried my child alive?\nYou were not certain my child was dead, and you buried it? Ah——”\n\nMadame Danglars had risen, and stood before the procureur, whose hands\nshe wrung in her feeble grasp.\n\n“I know not; I merely suppose so, as I might suppose anything else,”\nreplied Villefort with a look so fixed, it indicated that his powerful\nmind was on the verge of despair and madness.\n\n“Ah, my child, my poor child!” cried the baroness, falling on her\nchair, and stifling her sobs in her handkerchief. Villefort, becoming\nsomewhat reassured, perceived that to avert the maternal storm\ngathering over his head, he must inspire Madame Danglars with th"}, {"chunk_id": 366, "text": "ix times more easily traced;—then, when he has acquired his\nspecific, he administers duly to his enemy, or near kinsman, a dose of\narsenic which would make a mammoth or mastodon burst, and which,\nwithout rhyme or reason, makes his victim utter groans which alarm the\nentire neighborhood. Then arrive a crowd of policemen and constables.\nThey fetch a doctor, who opens the dead body, and collects from the\nentrails and stomach a quantity of arsenic in a spoon. Next day a\nhundred newspapers relate the fact, with the names of the victim and\nthe murderer. The same evening the grocer or grocers, druggist or\ndruggists, come and say, ‘It was I who sold the arsenic to the\ngentleman;’ and rather than not recognize the guilty purchaser, they\nwill recognize twenty. Then the foolish criminal is taken, imprisoned,\ninterrogated, confronted, confounded, condemned, and cut off by hemp or\nsteel; or if she be a woman of any consideration, they lock her up for\nlife. This is the way in which you Northerns understand chemistry,\nmadame. Desrues was, however, I must confess, more skilful.”\n\n“What would you have, sir?” said the lady, laughing; “we do what we\ncan. All the world has not the secret of the Medicis or the Borgias.”\n\n“Now,” replied the count, shrugging his shoulders, “shall I tell you\nthe cause of all these stupidities? It is because, at your theatres, by\nwhat at least I could judge by reading the pieces they play, they see\npersons swallow the contents of a phial, or suck the button of a ring,\nand fall dead instantly. Five minutes afterwards the curtain falls, and\nthe spectators depart. They are ignorant of the consequences of the\nmurder; they see neither the police commissary with his badge of\noffice, nor the corporal with his four men; and so the poor fools\nbelieve that the whole thing is as easy as lying. But go a little way\nfrom France—go either to Aleppo or Cairo, or only to Naples or Rome,\nand you will see people passing by you in the streets—people erect,\nsmiling, and fresh-colored, of whom Asmodeus, if you were holding on by\nthe skirt of his mantle, would say, ‘That man was poisoned three weeks\nago; he will be a dead man in a month.’”\n\n“Then,” remarked Madame de Villefort, “they have again discovered the\nsecret of the famous _aqua Tofana_ that they said was lost at Perugia.”\n\n“Ah, but madame, does mankind ever lose anything? The arts change about\nand make a tour of the world; things take a different name, and the\nvulgar do not follow them—that is all; but there is always the same\nresult. Poisons act particularly on some organ or another—one on the\nstomach, another on the brain, another on the intestines. Well, the\npoison brings on a cough, the cough an inflammation of the lungs, or\nsome other complaint catalogued in the book of science, which, however,\nby no means precludes it from being decidedly mortal; and if it were\nnot, would be sure to become so, thanks to the remedies applied by\nfoolish doctors, who are generally bad chemists, and which will act in\nfavor of or against the malady, as you please; and then there is a\nhuman being killed according to all the rules of art and skill, and of\nwhom justice learns nothing, as was said by a terrible chemist of my\nacquaintance, the worthy Abbé Adelmonte of Taormina, in Sicily, who has\nstudied these national phenomena very profoundly.”\n\n“It is quite frightful, but deeply interesting,” said the young lady,\nmotionless with attention. “I thought, I must confess, that these\ntales, were inventions of the Middle Ages.”\n\n“Yes, no doubt, but improved upon by ours. What is the use of time,\nrewards of merit, medals, crosses, Monthyon prizes, if they do not lead\nsociety towards more complete perfection? Yet man will never be perfect\nuntil he learns to create and destroy; he does know how to destroy, and\nthat is half the battle.”\n\n“So,” added Madame de Villefort, constantly returning to her object,\n“the poisons of the Borgias, the Medicis, the Renées, the Ruggieris,\nand later, probably, that of Baron de "}, {"chunk_id": 71, "text": "inspector; “and the abbé’s plan\nhas not even the merit of originality.”\n\nThen turning to Faria, “I inquired if you are well fed?” said he.\n\n“Swear to me,” replied Faria, “to free me if what I tell you prove\ntrue, and I will stay here while you go to the spot.”\n\n“Are you well fed?” repeated the inspector.\n\n“Monsieur, you run no risk, for, as I told you, I will stay here; so\nthere is no chance of my escaping.”\n\n“You do not reply to my question,” replied the inspector impatiently.\n\n“Nor you to mine,” cried the abbé. “You will not accept my gold; I will\nkeep it for myself. You refuse me my liberty; God will give it me.” And\nthe abbé, casting away his coverlet, resumed his place, and continued\nhis calculations.\n\n0177m\n\n\n\n“What is he doing there?” said the inspector.\n\n“Counting his treasures,” replied the governor.\n\nFaria replied to this sarcasm with a glance of profound contempt. They\nwent out. The turnkey closed the door behind them.\n\n“He was wealthy once, perhaps?” said the inspector.\n\n“Or dreamed he was, and awoke mad.”\n\n“After all,” said the inspector, “if he had been rich, he would not\nhave been here.”\n\nSo the matter ended for the Abbé Faria. He remained in his cell, and\nthis visit only increased the belief in his insanity.\n\nCaligula or Nero, those treasure-seekers, those desirers of the\nimpossible, would have accorded to the poor wretch, in exchange for his\nwealth, the liberty he so earnestly prayed for. But the kings of modern\ntimes, restrained by the limits of mere probability, have neither\ncourage nor desire. They fear the ear that hears their orders, and the\neye that scrutinizes their actions. Formerly they believed themselves\nsprung from Jupiter, and shielded by their birth; but nowadays they are\nnot inviolable.\n\nIt has always been against the policy of despotic governments to suffer\nthe victims of their persecutions to reappear. As the Inquisition\nrarely allowed its victims to be seen with their limbs distorted and\ntheir flesh lacerated by torture, so madness is always concealed in its\ncell, from whence, should it depart, it is conveyed to some gloomy\nhospital, where the doctor has no thought for man or mind in the\nmutilated being the jailer delivers to him. The very madness of the\nAbbé Faria, gone mad in prison, condemned him to perpetual captivity.\n\nThe inspector kept his word with Dantès; he examined the register, and\nfound the following note concerning him:\n\n_Edmond Dantès:_\n\nViolent Bonapartist; took an active part in the return from Elba.\n\nThe greatest watchfulness and care to be exercised.\n\nThis note was in a different hand from the rest, which showed that it\nhad been added since his confinement. The inspector could not contend\nagainst this accusation; he simply wrote, _Nothing to be done._\n\nThis visit had infused new vigor into Dantès; he had, till then,\nforgotten the date; but now, with a fragment of plaster, he wrote the\ndate, 30th July, 1816, and made a mark every day, in order not to lose\nhis reckoning again. Days and weeks passed away, then months—Dantès\nstill waited; he at first expected to be freed in a fortnight. This\nfortnight expired, he decided that the inspector would do nothing until\nhis return to Paris, and that he would not reach there until his\ncircuit was finished, he therefore fixed three months; three months\npassed away, then six more. Finally ten months and a half had gone by\nand no favorable change had taken place, and Dantès began to fancy the\ninspector’s visit but a dream, an illusion of the brain.\n\nAt the expiration of a year the governor was transferred; he had\nobtained charge of the fortress at Ham. He took with him several of his\nsubordinates, and amongst them Dantès’ jailer. A new governor arrived;\nit would have been too tedious to acquire the names of the prisoners;\nhe learned their numbers instead. This horrible place contained fifty\ncells; their inhabitants were designated by the numbers of their cell,\nand the unhappy young man was no longer called Edmond Dantès—he was now\nnumber 3"}, {"chunk_id": 109, "text": "gradually, besides the moral instructions we have detailed, taught his\nyouthful companion the patient and sublime duty of a prisoner, who\nlearns to make something from nothing. They were thus perpetually\nemployed,—Faria, that he might not see himself grow old; Dantès, for\nfear of recalling the almost extinct past which now only floated in his\nmemory like a distant light wandering in the night. So life went on for\nthem as it does for those who are not victims of misfortune and whose\nactivities glide along mechanically and tranquilly beneath the eye of\nProvidence.\n\nBut beneath this superficial calm there were in the heart of the young\nman, and perhaps in that of the old man, many repressed desires, many\nstifled sighs, which found vent when Faria was left alone, and when\nEdmond returned to his cell.\n\nOne night Edmond awoke suddenly, believing that he heard someone\ncalling him. He opened his eyes upon utter darkness. His name, or\nrather a plaintive voice which essayed to pronounce his name, reached\nhim. He sat up in bed and a cold sweat broke out upon his brow.\nUndoubtedly the call came from Faria’s dungeon.\n\n“Alas,” murmured Edmond; “can it be?”\n\nHe moved his bed, drew up the stone, rushed into the passage, and\nreached the opposite extremity; the secret entrance was open. By the\nlight of the wretched and wavering lamp, of which we have spoken,\nDantès saw the old man, pale, but yet erect, clinging to the bedstead.\nHis features were writhing with those horrible symptoms which he\nalready knew, and which had so seriously alarmed him when he saw them\nfor the first time.\n\n“Alas, my dear friend,” said Faria in a resigned tone, “you understand,\ndo you not, and I need not attempt to explain to you?”\n\nEdmond uttered a cry of agony, and, quite out of his senses, rushed\ntowards the door, exclaiming, “Help, help!”\n\nFaria had just sufficient strength to restrain him.\n\n“Silence,” he said, “or you are lost. We must now only think of you, my\ndear friend, and so act as to render your captivity supportable or your\nflight possible. It would require years to do again what I have done\nhere, and the results would be instantly destroyed if our jailers knew\nwe had communicated with each other. Besides, be assured, my dear\nEdmond, the dungeon I am about to leave will not long remain empty;\nsome other unfortunate being will soon take my place, and to him you\nwill appear like an angel of salvation. Perhaps he will be young,\nstrong, and enduring, like yourself, and will aid you in your escape,\nwhile I have been but a hindrance. You will no longer have half a dead\nbody tied to you as a drag to all your movements. At length Providence\nhas done something for you; he restores to you more than he takes away,\nand it was time I should die.”\n\nEdmond could only clasp his hands and exclaim, “Oh, my friend, my\nfriend, speak not thus!” and then resuming all his presence of mind,\nwhich had for a moment staggered under this blow, and his strength,\nwhich had failed at the words of the old man, he said, “Oh, I have\nsaved you once, and I will save you a second time!” And raising the\nfoot of the bed, he drew out the phial, still a third filled with the\nred liquor.\n\n“See,” he exclaimed, “there remains still some of the magic draught.\nQuick, quick! tell me what I must do this time; are there any fresh\ninstructions? Speak, my friend; I listen.”\n\n“There is not a hope,” replied Faria, shaking his head, “but no matter;\nGod wills it that man whom he has created, and in whose heart he has so\nprofoundly rooted the love of life, should do all in his power to\npreserve that existence, which, however painful it may be, is yet\nalways so dear.”\n\n“Oh, yes, yes!” exclaimed Dantès; “and I tell you that I will save you\nyet.”\n\n“Well, then, try. The cold gains upon me. I feel the blood flowing\ntowards my brain.

Is it not\na mere joke? Have I done this? It is the confusion of languages, as at\nBabel.

Besides, he set the example himself.\n\n\"Laugh, my friends,\" said he, \"laugh with a will! you cannot laugh as\nmuch as I do at myself.\"\n\nAnd he uttered the most formidable peal of laughter that ever issued\nfrom the mouth of a geographer.\n\n\"But we are none the less without an interpreter,\" said the major.\n\n\"Oh, do not be troubled,\" replied Paganel. \"The Portuguese and Spanish\nresemble each other so much that I made a mistake. However, this very\nresemblance will soon enable me to rectify my error, and in a short\ntime I will thank this worthy Patagonian in the language he speaks so\nwell.\"\n\nPaganel was right, for he could soon exchange a few words with the\nnative. He even learned that his name was Thalcave, a word which\nsignifies in Araucanian \"the thunderer.\" This surname was doubtless\ngiven to him for his skill in the use of fire-arms.\n\n[Sidenote: BETTER PROSPECTS.]\n\nBut Glenarvan was particularly rejoiced to discover that the Patagonian\nwas a guide, and, moreover, a guide of the Pampas.

Under this treatment, performed with an extreme gentleness,\nthe child felt his strength revive, and it was plain that a few hours\nwould suffice to restore him.\n\nIt was therefore decided that that day and the following night should\nbe passed at the encampment. Besides, two important questions remained\nto be settled--food, and means of conveyance."}, {"chunk_id": 71, "text": "lighted! Welcome, welcome! I am almost a Frenchman,\"\ncried the commander, shaking the geographer's arm with rather painful\nviolence.\n\n\"One of your friends?\" asked the major of Paganel.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied he, with national pride; \"we have friends in all parts\nof the world!\"\n\n[Illustration: \"Ah, I am delighted! Welcome, welcome! I am almost a\nFrenchman,\" cried the commander, shaking the geographer's arm with\nrather painful violence.]\n\n[Sidenote: RAISING A REGIMENT.]\n\nHe then entered into conversation with the commander. Glenarvan would\ngladly have put in a word in regard to his affairs, but the soldier\nwas telling his story, and was not in the mood to be interrupted.\nThis honest man had left France a long time before; and the native\nlanguage was no longer perfectly familiar to him: he had forgotten,\nif not words, at least the manner of combining them. As his visitors\nsoon learned, he had been a sergeant in the French army. Since the\nfoundation of the fort he had not left it, and commanded it by\nappointment from the Argentine government. He was by parentage a\nBasque, and his name was Manuel Ipharaguerre. A year after his arrival\nin the country, Sergeant Manuel was naturalized, joined the Argentine\narmy, and married an honest Indian woman, who had twins,--boys, to be\nsure, for the sergeant's worthy consort would never present him with\ndaughters. Manuel did not think of any other calling than that of the\nsoldier, and hoped, in time, with the help of God, to offer to the\nrepublic a whole battalion of young soldiers.\n\n\"You have seen them?\" said he. \"Charming fellows! Good soldiers! José!\nJuan! Miguel! Pepe! Pepe is only seven years old, and is already biting\nhis cartridge!\"\n\nPepe, hearing himself complimented, joined his two little feet, and\npresented arms with perfect precision.\n\n\"He will do!\" added the sergeant. \"He will be a major--or\nbrigadier-general one day!\"\n\nThis story lasted a quarter of an hour, to Thalcave's great\nastonishment. The Indian could not understand how so many words could\ncome from a single throat. No one interrupted the commander; and even\na French sergeant had to conclude at last, though not without forcing\nhis guests to accompany him to his dwelling. Here they were introduced\nto Madame Ipharaguerre, who appeared to be \"a good-looking person,\" if\nthis expression may be employed in regard to an Indian.\n\nWhen he had exhausted himself, the sergeant asked his guests to what he\nowed the honor of their visit. And now it was their turn to explain.\n\nPaganel, opening the conversation in French, told him of their journey\nacross the Pampas, and ended by asking why the Indians had abandoned\nthe country.\n\n\"War!\" replied the sergeant.\n\n\"War?\"\n\n\"Yes, civil war.\"\n\n\"Civil war?\" rejoined Paganel.\n\n\"Yes, war between Paraguay and Buenos Ayres,\" answered the sergeant.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Why, all the Indians of the north are in the rear of General Flores,\nand those of the plains are plundering.\"\n\n\"But the caziques?\"\n\n\"The caziques with them.\"\n\nThis answer was reported to Thalcave, who shook his head. Indeed,\nhe either did not know, or had forgotten, that a civil war, which\nwas afterwards to involve Brazil, was decimating two-thirds of the\nrepublic. The Indians had everything to gain in these internal\nstruggles, and could not neglect such fine opportunities for plunder.\nThe sergeant, therefore, was not mistaken in attributing this desertion\nof the Pampas to the civil war that was being waged in the northern\npart of the Argentine Provinces.\n\nBut this event disconcerted Glenarvan's hopes. If Captain Grant was\na prisoner of the caziques, he must have been carried by them to the\nnorthern frontiers. Yet how and where to find him? Must they attempt\na perilous and almost useless search to the northern limits of the\nPampas? It was a serious matter, which was to be earnestly considered.\n\nHowever, one important question was still to be asked of the sergeant,\nand the major thought of this, while his companions were looking at\neach other in silence.\n\n\"Hav"}, {"chunk_id": 48, "text": "ors with which he painted\nhis face. His leggings were of ox-hide, and fastened to the ankle with\nstraps regularly crossed.\n\nThe figure of this Patagonian was fine, and his face denoted real\nintelligence in spite of the colors that adorned (!) it. He waited in\nan attitude full of dignity, and, seeing him so motionless and stern on\nhis pedestal of rocks, you would have taken him for a statue.\n\nThe major, as soon as he perceived him, pointed him out to Glenarvan,\nwho hastened towards him. The Patagonian took two steps forward;\nGlenarvan took his hand, and pressed it. There was in the latter's\nlook, in his physiognomy, such a feeling, such an expression of\ngratitude, that the native could not mistake it. He inclined his head\ngently, and uttered a few words that neither the major nor his friend\ncould understand.\n\nThe Patagonian, after regarding the strangers attentively, now changed\nthe language; but whatever it was, this new idiom was no better\nunderstood than the first. However, certain expressions which he used\nstruck Glenarvan. They seemed to belong to the Spanish language, of\nwhich he knew several common words.\n\n\"Spanish?\" said he.\n\nThe Patagonian nodded.\n\n\"Well,\" said the major, \"this is our friend Paganel's business. It is\nfortunate that he thought of learning Spanish.\"\n\nPaganel was called. He came at once and with all the grace of a\nFrenchman saluted the Patagonian, to which the latter paid no\nattention. The geographer was informed of the state of affairs, and was\nonly too glad to use his diligently-acquired knowledge.\n\n[Sidenote: SOMETHING WRONG.]\n\n\"Exactly,\" said he. And opening his mouth widely in order to articulate\nbetter, he said, in his best Spanish,--\n\n\"You--are--a--brave--man.\"\n\nThe native listened, but did not answer.\n\n\"He does not understand,\" said the geographer.\n\n\"Perhaps you do not pronounce well,\" replied the major.\n\n\"Very true! Curse the pronunciation!\"\n\nAnd again Paganel began, but with no better success.\n\n\"I will change the expression,\" said he. And pronouncing with\nmagisterial slowness, he uttered these words,--\n\n\"A--Patagonian,--doubtless?\"\n\nThe native remained mute as before.\n\n\"Answer!\" added Paganel.\n\nThe Patagonian did not reply.\n\n\"Do--you--understand?\" cried Paganel, violently enough to damage his\norgans of speech.\n\nIt was evident that the Indian did not understand, for he answered, but\nin Spanish,--\n\n\"I do not understand.\"\n\nIt was Paganel's turn now to be astonished, and he hastily put on his\nglasses, like one irritated.\n\n\"May I be hanged,\" said he, \"if I understand a word of this infernal\njargon! It is certainly Araucanian.\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Glenarvan; \"this man answered in Spanish.\"\n\nAnd, turning to the Patagonian, he repeated,--\n\n\"Spanish?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the native.\n\nPaganel's surprise became amazement. The major and Glenarvan looked at\nhim quizzingly.\n\n\"Ah, my learned friend!\" said the major, while a half smile played\nabout his lips, \"you have committed one of those blunders peculiar to\nyou.\"\n\n\"What!\" cried the geographer, starting.\n\n\"Yes, it is plain that this Patagonian speaks Spanish.\"\n\n\"He?\"\n\n[Illustration: A man of lofty stature was standing, motionless, on\none of the first ledges of the mountain.

By mistake you have learnt another language, while thinking that\nyou studied----\"\n\nMacNabb did not finish. A loud \"Oh!\" from the geographer, accompanied\nby shrugs of the shoulders, cut him short.\n\n\"Major, you are going a little too far,\" said Paganel in a very dry\ntone.\n\n\"To be sure, since you do not understand.\"\n\n\"I do not understand because this native speaks so badly!\" answered the\ngeographer, who began to be impatient.\n\n\"That is to say, he speaks badly, because you do not understand,\"\nreturned the major, calmly.\n\n\"MacNabb,\" said Glenarvan, \"that is not a probable supposition.

Paganel,\nexcited and scarcely finding his words, resumed these interesting\ninterrogatories, while his eyes, fixed upon the grave Indian, strove\nto anticipate his reply before it issued from his lips. Every word the\nPatagonian said he repeated in English, so that his companions heard\nthe Indian speak, as it were, in their own language.\n\n\"And this prisoner?\" inquired Paganel.\n\n\"He was a stranger,\" replied Thalcave slowly; \"a European.\"\n\n\"You have seen him?\"\n\n\"No, but he is mentioned in the accounts of the Indians. He was a brave\nman.\"\n\n\"You understand, my friends,\" said Paganel; \"a courageous man!\"\n\n\"My father!\" cried Robert Grant.\n\nThen, addressing Paganel:\n\n\"How do you say 'It is my father,' in Spanish?\" he asked.\n\n\"_Es mio padre_,\" answered the geographer.\n\nImmediately Robert, taking Thalcave's hands, said in a sweet voice,--\n\n\"_Es mio padre!_\"\n\n\"_Suo padre!_\" replied the Patagonian, whose look brightened.\n\nHe took the boy in his arms, lifted him from his horse, and gazed at\nhim with the most curious sympathy. His intelligent countenance became\nsuffused with a peaceful emotion.\n\nBut Paganel had not finished his inquiries. Where was this prisoner?\nWhat was he doing? When had Thalcave heard of him? All these questions\nthronged his mind at once. He did not have to wait long for answers,\nbut learnt that the European was a slave of one of the Indian tribes\nthat scour the plains.\n\n\"But where was he last?\" asked Paganel.\n\n\"With the cazique Calfoucoura,\" answered Thalcave.\n\n\"On the line we have been following?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And who is this cazique?\"\n\n\"The chief of the Poyuches Indians; a man with two tongues and two\nhearts.\"\n\n[Sidenote: A SCIENTIFIC BATH.]\n\n\"That is to say, false in word and in deed,\" said Paganel, after\ntranslating to his companions this beautiful metaphor of the Indian\nlanguage. \"And can we rescue our friend?\" he added.\n\n\"Perhaps so, if your friend is still in the hands of the Indians.\"\n\n\"And when did you hear of him?\"\n\n\"A long time ago, and, since then, the sun has brought back two summers\nto the sky.\"\n\nGlenarvan's joy could not be described. This answer coincided exactly\nwith the date of the document. But one question remained to be asked.\n\n\"You speak of a prisoner,\" said Paganel; \"but were there not three?\"\n\n\"I do not know,\" replied Thalcave.\n\n\"And you know nothing of their actual situation?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\nThis last word ended the conversation. It was possible that the three\nprisoners had been separated a long time. But the substance of the\nPatagonian's information was that the Indians spoke of a European who\nhad fallen into their power. The date of his captivity, the place where\nhe must have been, everything, even to the Patagonian phrase used to\nexpress his courage, related evidently to Captain Harry Grant.\n\nTheir progress was now somewhat slow and difficult; their next object\nbeing to reach and cross the river Colorado, to w"}, {"chunk_id": 136, "text": "ie down, but, rifle on\nshoulder, guarded the encampment, walking to and fro that he might the\nbetter resist sleep. In spite of the absence of the moon, the night was\nalmost bright with the splendor of the southern constellations; and the\ngeographer amused himself in reading the great book of the firmament,\nwhich is always open. The silence of sleeping nature was broken only\nby the sound of the horses' chains as they rattled against their feet.\nPaganel was becoming fully absorbed in his astronomical meditations,\nand occupying himself more with the things of heaven than those of\nearth, when a distant sound startled him from his reverie.\n\nHe listened attentively, and, to his great astonishment, thought he\ndistinguished the tones of a piano. A few boldly-struck chords wafted\nto his ears their harmonious vibrations. He could not be mistaken.\n\n\"A piano in the desert!\" said he to himself. \"It cannot be!\"\n\nIt was indeed very surprising, and Paganel began to think that some\nstrange Australian bird was imitating the sound of the instrument.\n\n[Sidenote: A TWOFOLD SURPRISE.]\n\nBut at that moment a voice, harmoniously pitched, was heard. The\npianist was accompanied by a vocalist. The geographer listened\nincredulously, but in a few moments was forced to recognize the\nsublime air that struck upon his ear. It was \"_Il mio tesoro tanto_\"\nfrom Don Juan.\n\n[Illustration: Paganel did not lie down, but, rifle on shoulder,\nguarded the encampment, walking to and fro that he might the better\nresist sleep.]\n\n\"Parbleu!\" thought the geographer, \"however strange the Australian\nbirds may be, or even though the parrots were the most musical in the\nworld, they could not sing Mozart.\"\n\nHe listened to the end of this grand inspiration of the master. The\neffect of this sweet melody, in the stillness of the starlit night,\nwas indescribable. He remained a long time under the influences of its\nenchantment. At last the voice ceased, and all was silent.\n\nWhen Wilson came to relieve the geographer, he found him wrapt in a\nprofound reverie. Paganel said nothing to the sailor, but, reserving\nhis account of the incident for Glenarvan the next day, he crept into\nthe tent.\n\nIn the morning the whole party were awakened by unexpected bayings.\nGlenarvan at once arose. Two magnificent pointers were gamboling along\nthe edge of a small wood; but at the approach of the travelers they\ndisappeared among the trees, barking loudly.\n\n\"There must be a station in this desert,\" said Glenarvan, \"and hunters,\nsince those are hunting-dogs.\"\n\nPaganel was just about to relate his experiences of the past night,\nwhen two men appeared, in hunting costume, mounted on fine horses. They\nnaturally stopped at sight of the little party, encamped in gypsy-like\nfashion, and seemed to be wondering what the presence of armed men in\nthis place meant, when they perceived the ladies, who were alighting\nfrom the cart.\n\nThey immediately dismounted, and advanced towards them, hat in hand.\nGlenarvan went to meet them, and introduced himself and party, giving\nthe name and rank of each member. The young men bowed, and one of them,\nthe elder, said:\n\n\"My lord, will your ladies, your companions, and yourself do us the\nhonor to accompany us to our house?\"\n\n\"May I ask, gentlemen, whom I have the honor of addressing?\" inquired\nGlenarvan.\n\n\"Michael and Alexander Patterson, proprietors of Hottam Station.

He became Thalcave's\nshadow, and could not remain quiet in the presence of a real\nPatagonian, in comparison with whom he would have passed for a dwarf.\nHe overwhelmed the grave Indian with Spanish phrases, to which the\nlatter quietly listened. The geographer studied this time without a\nbook, and was often heard repeating words aloud.\n\n\"If I do not get the accent,\" said he to the major, \"you must not be\nangry with me. Who would have thought that one day a Patagonian would\nteach me Spanish!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\nNEWS OF THE LOST CAPTAIN.\n\n\nAt eight o'clock the next morning Thalcave gave the signal for\ndeparture. The slope was gradual, and the travelers had only to descend\na gentle declivity to the sea.\n\nWhen the Patagonian declined the horse that Glenarvan offered him, the\nlatter thought that he preferred to go on foot, according to the custom\nof certain guides; and indeed, his long legs ought to have made walking\neasy. But he was mistaken.\n\nAt the moment of departure Thalcave whistled in a peculiar manner.\nImmediately a magnificent Argentine horse, of superb form, issued from\na small wood near by, and approached at the call of his master. The\nanimal was perfectly beautiful. His brown color indicated a sound,\nspirited and courageous beast. He had a small and elegantly poised\nhead, widely opening nostrils, a fiery eye, large hams, swelling\nwithers, broad breast, long pasterns, in short, all the qualities that\nconstitute strength and suppleness. The major, like a perfect horseman,\nadmired unreservedly this specimen of the horses of the plains. This\nbeautiful creature was called Thaouka, which means \"bird\" in the\nPatagonian language, and he justly merited this appellation.\n\n[Sidenote: A FRESH START.]\n\nWhen Thalcave was in the saddle, the horse pranced with spirited grace,\nand the Patagonian, a skillful rider, was magnificent to behold. His\noutfit comprised two weapons of the chase, the \"bolas\" and the lasso.\nThe bolas consists of three balls tied together by a leathern string,\nwhich are fastened to the front of the saddle. The Indians frequently\nthrow them the distance of a hundred paces at the animal or enemy that\nthey are pursuing, and with such precision that they twist about their\nlegs and bring them to the ground. It is, therefore, in their hands a\nformidable instrument, and they handle it with surprising dexterity.\nThe lasso, on the contrary, does not leave the hand that wields it. It\nconsists simply of a leathern thong thirty feet in length, terminating\nin a slip-noose which works upon an iron ring. The right hand throws\nthe slip-noose, while the left hand holds the remainder of the lasso,\nthe end of which is firmly tied to the saddle. A long carbine in a\nsling completed the Patagonian's armament.\n\nThalcave, without observing the admiration caused by his natural\ngrace, ease and courage, took the lead, and the party advanced, now\nat a gallop, and now at a walk, for their horses seemed entirely\nunaccustomed to trotting. Robert mounted with much boldness, and\nspeedily convinced Glenarvan of his ability to keep his seat.\n\nOn issuing from the gorges of the Andes, they encountered a great\nnumber of sand-ridges, called \"medanos,\" real waves incessantly\nagitated by the wind, when the roots of the herbage did not confine\nthem to the earth. This sand is of an extreme fineness; and, at the\nleast breath, they saw it float away in light clouds, or form regular\nsand-columns which rose to a considerable height. This spectacle caused\npleasure as well as annoyance to the eyes. Pleasure, for nothing was\nmore curious than these columns, wandering over the plain, struggling,\nmingling, sinking and rising in inexpressible confusion; and annoyance,\nsince an impalpable dust emanated from these innumerable medanos and\npenetrated the eyelids, however tightly they were closed.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThis phenomenon continued during a great part of the day. Nevertheless,\nthey advanced rapidly, and towards six o'clock the A"}, {"chunk_id": 71, "text": "lighted! Welcome, welcome! I am almost a Frenchman,\"\ncried the commander, shaking the geographer's arm with rather painful\nviolence.\n\n\"One of your friends?\" asked the major of Paganel.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied he, with national pride; \"we have friends in all parts\nof the world!\"\n\n[Illustration: \"Ah, I am delighted! Welcome, welcome! I am almost a\nFrenchman,\" cried the commander, shaking the geographer's arm with\nrather painful violence.]\n\n[Sidenote: RAISING A REGIMENT.]\n\nHe then entered into conversation with the commander. Glenarvan would\ngladly have put in a word in regard to his affairs, but the soldier\nwas telling his story, and was not in the mood to be interrupted.\nThis honest man had left France a long time before; and the native\nlanguage was no longer perfectly familiar to him: he had forgotten,\nif not words, at least the manner of combining them. As his visitors\nsoon learned, he had been a sergeant in the French army. Since the\nfoundation of the fort he had not left it, and commanded it by\nappointment from the Argentine government. He was by parentage a\nBasque, and his name was Manuel Ipharaguerre. A year after his arrival\nin the country, Sergeant Manuel was naturalized, joined the Argentine\narmy, and married an honest Indian woman, who had twins,--boys, to be\nsure, for the sergeant's worthy consort would never present him with\ndaughters. Manuel did not think of any other calling than that of the\nsoldier, and hoped, in time, with the help of God, to offer to the\nrepublic a whole battalion of young soldiers.\n\n\"You have seen them?\" said he. \"Charming fellows! Good soldiers! José!\nJuan! Miguel! Pepe! Pepe is only seven years old, and is already biting\nhis cartridge!\"\n\nPepe, hearing himself complimented, joined his two little feet, and\npresented arms with perfect precision.\n\n\"He will do!\" added the sergeant. \"He will be a major--or\nbrigadier-general one day!\"\n\nThis story lasted a quarter of an hour, to Thalcave's great\nastonishment. The Indian could not understand how so many words could\ncome from a single throat. No one interrupted the commander; and even\na French sergeant had to conclude at last, though not without forcing\nhis guests to accompany him to his dwelling. Here they were introduced\nto Madame Ipharaguerre, who appeared to be \"a good-looking person,\" if\nthis expression may be employed in regard to an Indian.\n\nWhen he had exhausted himself, the sergeant asked his guests to what he\nowed the honor of their visit. And now it was their turn to explain.\n\nPaganel, opening the conversation in French, told him of their journey\nacross the Pampas, and ended by asking why the Indians had abandoned\nthe country.\n\n\"War!\" replied the sergeant.\n\n\"War?\"\n\n\"Yes, civil war.\"\n\n\"Civil war?\" rejoined Paganel.\n\n\"Yes, war between Paraguay and Buenos Ayres,\" answered the sergeant.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Why, all the Indians of the north are in the rear of General Flores,\nand those of the plains are plundering.\"\n\n\"But the caziques?\"\n\n\"The caziques with them.\"\n\nThis answer was reported to Thalcave, who shook his head. Indeed,\nhe either did not know, or had forgotten, that a civil war, which\nwas afterwards to involve Brazil, was decimating two-thirds of the\nrepublic. The Indians had everything to gain in these internal\nstruggles, and could not neglect such fine opportunities for plunder.\nThe sergeant, therefore, was not mistaken in attributing this desertion\nof the Pampas to the civil war that was being waged in the northern\npart of the Argentine Provinces.\n\nBut this event disconcerted Glenarvan's hopes. If Captain Grant was\na prisoner of the caziques, he must have been carried by them to the\nnorthern frontiers. Yet how and where to find him? Must they attempt\na perilous and almost useless search to the northern limits of the\nPampas? It was a serious matter, which was to be earnestly considered.\n\nHowever, one important question was still to be asked of the sergeant,\nand the major thought of this, while his companions were looking at\neach other in silence.\n\n\"Hav"}, {"chunk_id": 136, "text": "ie down, but, rifle on\nshoulder, guarded the encampment, walking to and fro that he might the\nbetter resist sleep.

The silence of sleeping nature was broken only\nby the sound of the horses' chains as they rattled against their feet.\nPaganel was becoming fully absorbed in his astronomical meditations,\nand occupying himself more with the things of heaven than those of\nearth, when a distant sound startled him from his reverie.\n\nHe listened attentively, and, to his great astonishment, thought he\ndistinguished the tones of a piano. A few boldly-struck chords wafted\nto his ears their harmonious vibrations. He could not be mistaken.\n\n\"A piano in the desert!\" said he to himself. \"It cannot be!\"\n\nIt was indeed very surprising, and Paganel began to think that some\nstrange Australian bird was imitating the sound of the instrument.\n\n[Sidenote: A TWOFOLD SURPRISE.]\n\nBut at that moment a voice, harmoniously pitched, was heard. The\npianist was accompanied by a vocalist. The geographer listened\nincredulously, but in a few moments was forced to recognize the\nsublime air that struck upon his ear. It was \"_Il mio tesoro tanto_\"\nfrom Don Juan.\n\n[Illustration: Paganel did not lie down, but, rifle on shoulder,\nguarded the encampment, walking to and fro that he might the better\nresist sleep.]\n\n\"Parbleu!\" thought the geographer, \"however strange the Australian\nbirds may be, or even though the parrots were the most musical in the\nworld, they could not sing Mozart.\"\n\nHe listened to the end of this grand inspiration of the master. The\neffect of this sweet melody, in the stillness of the starlit night,\nwas indescribable. He remained a long time under the influences of its\nenchantment. At last the voice ceased, and all was silent.\n\nWhen Wilson came to relieve the geographer, he found him wrapt in a\nprofound reverie. Paganel said nothing to the sailor, but, reserving\nhis account of the incident for Glenarvan the next day, he crept into\nthe tent.\n\nIn the morning the whole party were awakened by unexpected bayings.\nGlenarvan at once arose. Two magnificent pointers were gamboling along\nthe edge of a small wood; but at the approach of the travelers they\ndisappeared among the trees, barking loudly.\n\n\"There must be a station in this desert,\" said Glenarvan, \"and hunters,\nsince those are hunting-dogs.\"\n\nPaganel was just about to relate his experiences of the past night,\nwhen two men appeared, in hunting costume, mounted on fine horses. They\nnaturally stopped at sight of the little party, encamped in gypsy-like\nfashion, and seemed to be wondering what the presence of armed men in\nthis place meant, when they perceived the ladies, who were alighting\nfrom the cart.\n\nThey immediately dismounted, and advanced towards them, hat in hand.\nGlenarvan went to meet them, and introduced himself and party, giving\nthe name and rank of each member. The young men bowed, and one of them,\nthe elder, said:\n\n\"My lord, will your ladies, your companions, and yourself do us the\nhonor to accompany us to our house?\"\n\n\"May I ask, gentlemen, whom I have the honor of addressing?\" inquired\nGlenarvan.\n\n\"Michael and Alexander Patterson, proprietors of Hottam Station.

Thus he did not\nhear Glenarvan's request, and the latter was forced to repeat it.\n\n\"Very well,\" replied Paganel; \"I am ready.\"\n\nSo saying, he mechanically produced his note-book. He tore out a blank\npage, and then, with his pencil in his hand, made ready to write.\nGlenarvan began to dictate the following instructions:\n\n\"Order for Tom Austin to put to sea, and bring the Duncan----\"\n\nPaganel had just finished this last word when his eyes fell upon the\nnumber of the _Australian and New Zealand Gazette_ that lay upon the\nground. The paper, being folded, only allowed him to see the two last\nsyllables of its title. His pencil stopped, and he seemed to completely\nforget Glenarvan and his letter.\n\n\"Well, Paganel?\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\"Ah!\" continued the geographer, uttering a cry.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" asked the major.\n\n\"Nothing! nothing!\" replied Paganel.

But\nthis state of nervous excitation did not last. He gradually grew calm.\nThe joy that gleamed in his eyes died away, and, resuming his place, he\nsaid, in a quiet tone:\n\n\"When you wish, my lord, I am at your disposal.\"\n\nGlenarvan continued the dictation of his letter, which was distinctly\nworded as follows:\n\n\"Order for Tom Austin to put to sea, and bring the Duncan to the\neastern coast of Australia.\"\n\n\"Australia?\" cried Paganel. \"Ah, yes, Australia!\"\n\nThe letter was now finished, and presented to Glenarvan for his\nsignature, who, although affected by his recent wound, acquitted\nhimself as well as possible of this formality. The note was then\nfolded and sealed, while Paganel, with a hand that still trembled from\nexcitement, wrote the following address:\n\n                         \"Tom Austin,\n                             \"Mate of the Yacht Duncan,\n                                      \"Melbourne.\"\n\nThereupon he left the cart, gesticulating, and repeating these\nincomprehensible words:\n\n\"Aland! aland!

Everything was\nready for the departure of Mulready, who was happy to give his master\nthis proof of his devotion.\n\nPaganel had regained his coolness and accustomed manners. His look\nstill indicated an uneasy state of mind, but he appeared decided to\nkeep his secret. He had doubtless strong reasons for acting thus,\nfor the major overheard him repeating these words, like a man who is\nstruggling with himself:\n\n\"No, no! they would not believe me! And, besides what use is it? It is\ntoo late!\"\n\n[Illustration: \"Adieu, my lord,\" said he, in a calm voice, and soon\ndisappeared by a path along the edge of the wood.]\n\nThis resolution taken, he occupied himself with giving Mulready the\nnecessary directions for reaching Melbourne, and, with the map before\nhim, marked out his course. All the trails of the prairie converged\ntowards the Lucknow road, which, after extending straight southward to\nthe coast, suddenly turned in the direction towards Melbourne. It was\nsimply necessary to follow this, and not attempt to cross the unknown\ncountry. Mulready could not, therefore, go astray. As for dangers, they\nlay only a few miles beyond the encampment, where Ben Joyce and his\nband were probably lying in wait.

It is Portuguese that you have been studying for six\nweeks.\"\n\n\"Camoëns! Lusiad! Portuguese!\"\n\nPaganel could say no more. His eyes wandered, while a peal of Homeric\nlaughter rang in his ears.\n\nThe Patagonian did not wink; he waited patiently for the explanation of\nthis event, which was totally incomprehensible to him.\n\n\"Insensate! fool!\" cried Paganel, at last. \"What! is it so? Is it not\na mere joke? Have I done this? It is the confusion of languages, as at\nBabel.

Besides, he set the example himself.\n\n\"Laugh, my friends,\" said he, \"laugh with a will! you cannot laugh as\nmuch as I do at myself.\"\n\nAnd he uttered the most formidable peal of laughter that ever issued\nfrom the mouth of a geographer.\n\n\"But we are none the less without an interpreter,\" said the major.\n\n\"Oh, do not be troubled,\" replied Paganel. \"The Portuguese and Spanish\nresemble each other so much that I made a mistake. However, this very\nresemblance will soon enable me to rectify my error, and in a short\ntime I will thank this worthy Patagonian in the language he speaks so\nwell.\"\n\nPaganel was right, for he could soon exchange a few words with the\nnative. He even learned that his name was Thalcave, a word which\nsignifies in Araucanian \"the thunderer.\" This surname was doubtless\ngiven to him for his skill in the use of fire-arms.\n\n[Sidenote: BETTER PROSPECTS.]\n\nBut Glenarvan was particularly rejoiced to discover that the Patagonian\nwas a guide, and, moreover, a guide of the Pampas. There was,\ntherefore, something so providential in this meeting that the success\nof the enterprise seemed already an accomplished fact, and no one any\nlonger doubted the rescue of Captain Grant.\n\nIn the meantime the travelers and the Patagonian had returned to\nRobert.

It was\nnecessary to use a hammer, for the stony covering had acquired the\nhardness of granite. The fragments soon strewed the table, and several\npieces of paper were perceived adhering to each other. Glenarvan drew\nthem out carefully, separating and examining them closely, while Lady\nHelena, the major, and the captain crowded around him.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nTHE THREE DOCUMENTS.\n\n\nThese pieces of paper, half destroyed by the sea-water, exhibited only\na few words, the traces of handwriting almost entirely effaced.

The\npianist was accompanied by a vocalist. The geographer listened\nincredulously, but in a few moments was forced to recognize the\nsublime air that struck upon his ear. It was \"_Il mio tesoro tanto_\"\nfrom Don Juan.\n\n[Illustration: Paganel did not lie down, but, rifle on shoulder,\nguarded the encampment, walking to and fro that he might the better\nresist sleep.]\n\n\"Parbleu!\" thought the geographer, \"however strange the Australian\nbirds may be, or even though the parrots were the most musical in the\nworld, they could not sing Mozart.\"\n\nHe listened to the end of this grand inspiration of the master. The\neffect of this sweet melody, in the stillness of the starlit night,\nwas indescribable. He remained a long time under the influences of its\nenchantment. At last the voice ceased, and all was silent.\n\nWhen Wilson came to relieve the geographer, he found him wrapt in a\nprofound reverie. Paganel said nothing to the sailor, but, reserving\nhis account of the incident for Glenarvan the next day, he crept into\nthe tent.\n\nIn the morning the whole party were awakened by unexpected bayings.\nGlenarvan at once arose. Two magnificent pointers were gamboling along\nthe edge of a small wood; but at the approach of the travelers they\ndisappeared among the trees, barking loudly.\n\n\"There must be a station in this desert,\" said Glenarvan, \"and hunters,\nsince those are hunting-dogs.\"\n\nPaganel was just about to relate his experiences of the past night,\nwhen two men appeared, in hunting costume, mounted on fine horses. They\nnaturally stopped at sight of the little party, encamped in gypsy-like\nfashion, and seemed to be wondering what the presence of armed men in\nthis place meant, when they perceived the ladies, who were alighting\nfrom the cart.\n\nThey immediately dismounted, and advanced towards them, hat in hand.\nGlenarvan went to meet them, and introduced himself and party, giving\nthe name and rank of each member. The young men bowed, and one of them,\nthe elder, said:\n\n\"My lord, will your ladies, your companions, and yourself do us the\nhonor to accompany us to our house?\"\n\n\"May I ask, gentlemen, whom I have the honor of addressing?\" inquired\nGlenarvan.\n\n\"Michael and Alexander Patterson, proprietors of Hottam Station. You\nare already on the grounds of the establishment, and have but a quarter\nof a mile to go.\"\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" replied Glenarvan, \"I should be unwilling to slight a\nhospitality so graciously offered----\"\n\n\"My lord,\" interrupted Michael Patterson, \"by accepting you will confer\na favor upon two poor colonists, who will be only too happy to extend\nto you the honors of the desert.\"\n\nGlenarvan bowed in token of assent.\n\n\"Sir,\" said Paganel, addressing Michael Patterson, \"should I be too\ninquisitive were I to ask if it was you who sang that divine air of\nMozart last night?\"\n\n\"It was I, sir,\" replied the gentleman; \"and my brother "}]}

In my opinion this man's\nreal name is Ayrton. Ben Joyce is his fighting title. It is certain\nthat he knows Harry Grant, and has been quartermaster on board the\nBritannia. These facts, proved already by the precise details given\nby Ayrton, are still further corroborated by the conversation of the\nconvicts that I have related. Let us not, therefore, be led astray\nby vain conjectures, but only be certain that Ayrton is Ben Joyce, a\nsailor of the Britannia, now chief of a band of convicts.\"\n\nThe major's explanation was accepted as conclusive.\n\n\"Now,\" replied Glenarvan, \"will you tell me how and why Harry Grant's\nquartermaster is in Australia?\"\n\n\"How, I do not know,\" said MacNabb; \"and the police declare they know\nno more than I on the subject.

Chance threw us in his way. He heard Glenarvan's story of the\nshipwreck, and, like a bold man, he promptly decided to take part in\nthe expedition. At the Wimerra he communicated with one of his friends,\nthe farrier of Black Point, and thus left distinguishable traces of\nour course. His band followed us. A poisonous plant enabled him to\ngradually kill our oxen and horses. Then, at the proper moment, he\nentangled us in the marshes of the Snowy, and surrendered us to the\nconvicts he commanded.\"\n\nEverything possible had been said concerning Ben Joyce. His past had\njust been reviewed by the major, and the wretch appeared as he was,--a\nbold and formidable criminal. His intentions had been clearly proved,\nand required, on the part of Glenarvan, extreme vigilance. Fortunately,\nthere was less to fear from the detected bandit than the secret traitor.\n\nBut one serious fact appeared from this explanation. No one had yet\nthought of it; only Mary Grant, disregarding the past, looked forward\nto the future. Captain Mangles first saw her pale and disconsolate. He\nunderstood what was passing in her mind.\n\n\"Miss Mary!\" cried he, \"you are weeping!\"\n\n\"What is the matter, my child?\" asked Lady Helena.\n\n\"My father, madam, my father!\" replied the young girl.\n\nShe could not continue.

They are personal experiences, and will\nscarcely tend to put you on the track you have lost.\"\n\n[Sidenote: REVELATIONS AND DISCLOSURES.]\n\nA keen disappointment was manifest on the features of Glenarvan and\nthe major. They had believed the quartermaster to possess an important\nsecret, and yet he now confessed that his disclosures would be almost\nuseless.\n\nHowever that may be, this avowal of Ayrton, who surrendered himself\nwithout security, singularly affected his hearers, especially when he\nadded, in conclusion:\n\n\"Thus you are forewarned, my lord, that the business will be less\nadvantageous for you than for me.\"\n\n\"No matter,\" replied Glenarvan; \"I accept your proposal, Ayrton. You\nhave my word that you shall be landed at one of the islands of the\nPacific.\"\n\n\"Very well, my lord,\" said he.\n\nWas this strange man pleased with this decision? You might have doubted\nit, for his impassive countenance betrayed no emotion. He seemed as if\nacting for another more than for himself.\n\n\"I am ready to answer,\" continued he.\n\n\"We have no questions to ask you,\" rejoined Glenarvan. \"Tell us what\nyou know, Ayrton, and, in the first place, who you are.\"\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" replied he, \"I am really Tom Ayrton, quartermaster of the\nBritannia. I left Glasgow in Captain Grant's ship on the 12th of March,\n1861. For fourteen months we traversed together the Pacific, seeking\nsome favorable place to found a Scottish colony. Harry Grant was a man\ncapable of performing great deeds, but frequently serious disputes\narose between us. His character did not harmonize with mine. I could\nnot yield; but with Harry Grant, when his resolution is taken, all\nresistance is impossible. He is like iron towards himself and others.\nHowever, I dared to mutiny, and attempted to involve the crew and gain\npossession of the vessel. Whether I did right or wrong is of little\nimportance. However it may be, Captain Grant did not hesitate to land\nme, April 8, 1862, on the west coast of Australia.\"\n\n\"Australia!\" exclaimed the major, interrupting Ayrton's story. \"Then\nyou left the Britannia before her arrival at Callao, where the last\nnews of her was dated?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the quartermaster; \"for the Britannia never stopped at\nCallao while I was on board. If I spoke of Callao at O'Moore's farm, it\nwas your story that gave me this information.\"\n\n\"Go on, Ayrton,\" said Glenarvan.\n\n[Sidenote: MORE BLANKS THAN PRIZES.]\n\n\"I found myself, therefore, abandoned on an almost desert coast, but\nonly twenty miles from the penitentiary of Perth, the capital of\nWestern Australia. Wandering along the shore, I met a band of convicts\nwho had just escaped. I joined them. You will spare me, my lord, the\naccount of my life for two years and a half. It is enough to know that\nI became chief of the runaways, under the name of Ben Joyce. In the\nmonth of September, 1864, I made my appearance at the Irishman's farm,\nand was received as a servant under my true name of Ayrton. Here I\nwaited till an opportunity should be offered to gain possession of a\nvessel. This was my great object. Two months later the Duncan arrived.\nDuring your visit at the farm you related, my lord, the whole story of\nCaptain Grant. I then learned what I had not known, the Britannia's\nstoppage at Callao, the last news of her, dated June, 1862, two months\nafter my abandonment, the finding of the document, the shipwreck of the\nvessel, and finally the important reasons you had for seeking Captain\nGrant in Australia. I did not hesitate, but resolved to appropriate\nthe Duncan,--a marvelous ship, that would have distanced the best of\nthe British navy. However, there were serious injuries to be repaired.\nI therefore let her start for Melbourne, and offered myself to you in\nmy real character of quartermaster, volunteering to guide you to the\nscene o"}, {"chunk_id": 20, "text": "a talker; but\nhe was abstracted, after the manner of those who do not see what they\nare looking at or hear what they are listening to. He wore a traveling\ncap, stout yellow buskins and leather gaiters, pantaloons of maroon\nvelvet, and a jacket of the same material, whose innumerable pockets\nseemed stuffed with note-books, memoranda, scraps, portfolios, and a\nthousand articles as inconvenient as they were useless, not to speak\nof a telescope which he carried in a sling.\n\nThe curiosity of this unknown being was a singular contrast to the\ncalmness of the major. He walked around MacNabb, and gazed at him\nquestioningly, whilst the latter did not trouble himself whence the\nstranger came, whither he was going, or why he was on board the Duncan.\n\nWhen this enigmatical character saw his approaches mocked by the\nindifference of the major, he seized his telescope, which at its full\nlength measured four feet; and motionless, with legs straddled, like a\nsign-post on a highway, he pointed his instrument to the line where sky\nand water met. After a few moments of examination, he lowered it, and\nresting it on the deck, leaned upon it as upon a cane. But immediately\nthe joints of the instrument closed, and the newly discovered\npassenger, whose point of support suddenly failed, was stretched at the\nfoot of the mainmast.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nAny one else in the major's place would at least have smiled, but he\ndid not even wink. The unknown then assumed his rôle.\n\n\"Steward!\" he cried, with an accent that betokened a foreigner.\n\nHe waited.

What was his astonishment to hear himself thus addressed by\nthis tall individual, who was utterly unknown to him!\n\n\"Where did this person come from?\" said he to himself. \"A friend of\nLord Glenarvan? It is impossible.\"\n\nHowever, he came on deck, and approached the stranger.\n\n\"Are you the steward of the vessel?\" the latter asked him.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Olbinett; \"but I have not the honor----\"\n\n\"I am the passenger of cabin number six.\"\n\n\"Number six?\" repeated the steward.\n\n\"Certainly; and your name is----?\"\n\n\"Olbinett.\"\n\n\"Well, Olbinett, my friend,\" answered the stranger of cabin number six,\n\"I must think of dinner, and acutely, too. For thirty-six hours I have\neaten nothing, or, rather, have slept, which is pardonable in a man\ncome all the way from Paris to Glasgow. What hour do you dine, if you\nplease?\"\n\n\"At nine o'clock,\" answered Olbinett, mechanically.\n\nThe stranger attempted to consult his watch; but this took some time,\nfor he did not find it till he came to his ninth pocket.\n\n[Sidenote: CONFUSION WORSE CONFOUNDED.]\n\n\"Well,\" said he, \"it is not yet eight o'clock; therefore, Olbinett, a\nbiscuit and a glass of sherry for the present; for I am fainting with\nhunger.\"\n\nOlbinett listened without understanding.

The major was a man of fifty, of calm,\nregular features, who did as he was bid; of an excellent and superior\ncharacter, modest, taciturn, peaceable, and mild; always agreeing\nwith anything or any one, disputing nothing, and neither contradicting\nhimself nor exaggerating. He would mount with measured step the\nstaircase to his bed-chamber, even were a cannon-ball behind him; and\nprobably to his dying day would never find an opportunity to fly into a\npassion.\n\nThis man possessed, in a high degree, not only the common courage of\nthe battle-field (that physical bravery due only to nervous strength),\nbut, better still, moral courage, that is to say, firmness of soul. If\nhe had a fault, it was that of being absolutely Scotch from head to\nfoot, a pure-blooded Caledonian, an infatuated observer of the ancient\ncustoms of his country. Through his relationship to the Glenarvans he\nlived at Malcolm Castle; and as major and military man it was very\nnatural that he should be found on board the Duncan.\n\nSuch, then, were the passengers of this yacht, summoned by unforeseen\ncircumstances to accomplish one of the most surprising voyages of\nmodern times. Since her arrival at the wharf at Glasgow, she had\nmonopolized the public attention. A considerable number came every day\nto visit her. They were interested in her alone, and spoke only of her,\nto the great umbrage of the other captains of the port, among others\nCaptain Burton, commanding the Scotia, a magnificent steamer, moored\nbeside the Duncan, and bound for Calcutta. The Scotia, from her size,\nhad a right to consider the Duncan as a mere fly-boat. Nevertheless,\nall the attraction centred in Lord Glenarvan's yacht, and increased\nfrom day to day.\n\nThe time of departure approached. Captain Mangles had shown himself\nskillful and expeditious. A month after her trial trip in the Frith of\nClyde, the Duncan, laden, provisioned, and equipped, was ready to put\nto sea. The 25th of August was appointed for the time of departure,\nwhich would enable the yacht to reach the southern latitudes by the\nbeginning of spring. Lord Glenarvan, when his plan was matured, did\nnot neglect to make investigations into the hardships and perils of the\nvoyage; yet he did not hesitate on this account, but prepared to leave\nMalcolm Castle.\n\nOn the 24th of August, Lord and Lady Glenarvan, Major MacNabb, Mary and\nRobert Grant, Mr. Olbinett, the steward of the yacht, and his wife, who\nwas in the service of Lady Glenarvan, left the castle, after taking an\naffectionate farewell of their family servants. Several hours afterward\nthey found themselves on board. Many of the population of Glasgow\nwelcomed with sympathetic admiration the young and courageous lady who\nrenounced the pleasures of a life of luxury, and sailed to the rescue\nof the shipwrecked sailors.\n\nThe apartments of Lord Glenarvan and his wife occupied the entire stern\nof the vessel. They consisted of two bed-chambers, a parlor, and two\ndressing-rooms, adjoining which was an open square inclosed by six\ncabins, five of which were occupied by Mary and Robert Grant, Mr. and\nMrs. Olbinett, and Major MacNabb. As for the cabins of the captain and\nthe mate, they were situated in the forecastle, and opened on the deck.\nThe crew were lodged between-decks very comfortably, for the yacht of\ncourse carried nothing but her coal, provisions, and armament.\n\nThe Duncan was to start on the night of the 24th, as the tide fell at\nthree o'clock in the morning. But first those who were present were\nwitness to a touching scene. At eight in the evening Lord Glenarvan and\nhis companions, the entire crew, from the firemen to the captain, all\nwho were to take part in this voyage of sacrifice, left the yacht,"}, {"chunk_id": 110, "text": "y listened to them with tearful eyes. Paganel could not find a word\nof consolation or hope. Captain Mangles suffered a grief that he could\nnot subdue. Despair was seizing upon the souls of the noble people whom\nthe Duncan had vainly brought to these distant shores, when all at once\na voice was heard:--\n\n\"My lord, praise and thank God! If Captain Grant is living, he is in\nAustralia.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI.\n\nTHE QUARTERMASTER OF THE BRITANNIA.\n\n\nThe astonishment that these words produced cannot be described.\nGlenarvan sprang to his feet, and, pushing back his chair, cried,--\n\n\"Who says that?\"\n\n\"I!\" replied one of O'Moore's workmen, seated at the end of the table.\n\n\"You, Ayrton?\" said the colonist, no less astonished than Glenarvan.\n\n\"I,\" repeated Ayrton, in an excited but firm tone; \"I, a Scotchman like\nyourself, my lord, one of the shipwrecked sailors of the Britannia!\"\n\n[Sidenote: A FRESH FACE.]\n\nMary Grant, half fainting with emotion, and overcome with happiness,\nsank into the arms of Lady Helena; while Captain Mangles, Robert, and\nPaganel went towards the man whom their host had called Ayrton.\n\nHe was a somewhat rough-looking, broad-shouldered man, of about\nforty-five, of more than medium height, and with piercing eyes sunk\ndeeply beneath his projecting brows. His strength must have been\nunusual, even considering his stature, for he was all bone and sinew.\nHis countenance, full of intelligence and energy, although the features\nwere stern, prepossessed one in his favor. The sympathy that he\nelicited was still more increased by the traces of recent hardships\nimprinted upon his face. It was evident that he had suffered much,\nalthough he seemed a man able to brave, endure, and conquer suffering.\n\nThe travelers felt all this at first sight. Ayrton's appearance had\ninterested them; and Glenarvan, acting as spokesman for all, pressed\nhim with inquiries. This strange meeting had evidently produced a\nbewildering effect, and the first questions were, to some extent,\nwithout order.\n\n\"You are one of the sailors of the Britannia?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"Yes, my lord; Captain Grant's quartermaster,\" replied Ayrton.\n\n\"Saved with him from the shipwreck?\"\n\n\"No, my lord. At that terrible moment I was washed overboard and cast\nashore.\"\n\n\"You are not one of the sailors, then, of whom the document makes\nmention?\"\n\n\"No; I did not know of the existence of such a document. The captain\nmust have thrown it overboard after I was gone.\"\n\n\"But the captain, the captain?\"\n\n\"I suppose he was lost, drowned, with the rest of the crew. I thought I\nwas the sole survivor.\"\n\n\"But you said that Captain Grant was living!\"\n\n[Illustration: He was a somewhat rough-looking, broad-shouldered man,\nof about forty-five.]\n\n[Illustration: \"When I was washed from the forecastle, as I was hauling\ndown the jib, the Britannia was driving towards the coast of Australia,\nwhich was not two cable-lengths distant.\"]\n\n\"No. I said, 'if the captain is living'----\"\n\n\"'He is in Australia,' you added.\"\n\n\"He can be nowhere else.\"\n\n\"You do not know, then, where he is?\"\n\n\"No, my lord. I repeat that I thought he was buried in the waves or\ndashed upon the rocks. You say that perhaps he is still living.\"\n\n\"What do you know, then?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"Simply this, that if Captain Grant is living he is in Australia.\"\n\n\"Where did the shipwreck take place?\" inquired the major.\n\nThis should have been the first question; but, in the excitement of the\nmoment, Glenarvan, anxious to know where Captain Grant was, had not\ninquired where the Britannia was lost. From this point the conversation\nassumed a more definite form, and soon the details of the complicated\nstory appeared clear and exact to the minds of Ayrton's hearers.\n\nTo the major's question Ayrton replied,--\n\n\"When I was washed from the forecastle, as I was hauling down the jib,\nthe Britannia was driving towards the coast of Australia, which was not\ntwo cable-lengths distant. The shipwreck, therefore, took place at that\npoint.\"\n\n\"In latitude thirty-seven?\""}]}

A ferocious man-eater like the\njaguar! With one blow of his paw he can twist the neck of a horse. When\nhe has tasted human flesh, however, he returns to it ravenously. What\nhe likes best is the Indian, then the negro, then the mulatto, and then\nthe white man.\"\n\n\"However that may be, my good Paganel,\" said Glenarvan, \"so long as\nthere are no Indians, mulattoes, or negroes among us, I rejoice in\nthe absence of your dear jaguars.

A second line of stakes, and then a fence of osiers,\npierced with loop-holes, inclosed the inner space, the court-yard of\nthe pah, in which stood several Maori tents, and forty huts which were\nsymmetrically arranged.\n\nOn their arrival, the captives were terribly impressed at sight of\nthe heads that ornamented the stakes of the second inclosure. Lady\nHelena and Mary Grant turned away their eyes with more of disgust than\nterror. These heads had most of them belonged to hostile chiefs, fallen\nin battle, whose bodies had served as food for the conquerors. The\ngeographer knew them to be such by their hollow and eyeless sockets!\n\nIn Kai-Koumou's pah only the heads of his enemies formed this frightful\nmuseum; and here, doubtless, more than one English skull had served to\nincrease the size of the chief's collection.\n\nHis hut, among those belonging to warriors of lower rank, stood at the\nrear of the pah, in front of a large open terrace. This structure was\nbuilt of stakes, interlaced with branches, and lined inside with flax\nmatting.\n\nOnly one opening gave access to the dwelling. A thick curtain, made\nof a vegetable tissue, served as a door. The roof projected so as to\nform a water-shed. Several faces, carved at the ends of the rafters,\nadorned the hut, and the curtain was covered with various imitations\nof foliage, symbolical figures, monsters, and graceful sculpturing,\na curious piece of work, fashioned by the scissors of the native\ndecorators.\n\n[Sidenote: FEMININE ORATORY.]\n\nInside of the habitation the floor was made of hard-trodden earth,\nand raised six inches above the ground. Several rush screens and some\nmattresses, covered with woven matting of long leaves and twigs,\nserved as beds. In the middle of the room a hole in a stone formed the\nfireplace, and another in the roof answered for a chimney.\n\nThe smoke, when it became sufficiently thick, perforce escaped at this\noutlet, but it of course blackened the walls of the house.\n\nOn one side of the hut were storehouses, containing the chief's\nprovisions, his harvest of flax, potatoes, and edible ferns, and\nthe ovens where the various articles of food were cooked by contact\nwith heated stones. Farther off, in small pens, pigs and goats were\nconfined, and dogs ran about seeking their scanty sustenance. They were\nrather poorly kept, for animals that formed the Maori daily food.\n\nGlenarvan and his companions had taken in the whole at a glance. They\nawaited beside an empty hut the good pleasure of the chief, exposed to\nthe insults of a crowd of old women, who surrounded them like harpies,\nand threatened them with their fists, crying and howling. Several\nEnglish words that passed their lips clearly indicated that they were\ndemanding immediate vengeance.\n\nIn the midst of these cries and threats, Lady Helena affected a\ncalmness that she could not feel in her heart. This courageous woman,\nin order that her husband's coolness might not forsake him, heroically\ncontrolled her emotions. Poor Mary Grant felt herself growing weak, and\nCaptain Mangles supported her, ready to die in her defence. The others\nendured this torrent of invectives in various ways, either indifferent\nlike the major, or increasingly annoyed like Paganel.\n\nGlenarvan, wishing to relieve Lady Helena from the assaults of these\nshrews, boldly approached Kai-Koumou, and, pointing to the hideous\nthrong, said:\n\n\"Drive them away!\"\n\nThe Maori chief gazed steadily at his prisoner without replying. Then\nwith a gesture he silenced the noisy horde. Glenarvan bowed in token of\nthanks, and slowly resumed his place among his friends.\n\nKai-Koumou, fearing an insurrection of the fanatics of his tribe, now\nled his captives to a sacred place, situated at the other end of the\npah, on the edge of a precipice. This hut rested against a rock that\nrose a hundred feet above it and was a steep boundary to this side of\nthe fortification. In this consecrated temple the priests, or \"arikis,\"\ninstruct the New Zealanders. The buildin"}, {"chunk_id": 42, "text": "HE GODS.\"]\n\n\"Delicious! a dish for the gods! I knew well that you would like fresh\nmeat for supper. And what meat this is!

A Frenchman is always a cook.\"\n\nIn a little while Paganel placed large slices of meat on the coals,\nand, in a short time, served up to his companions this appetizing\nviand. No one hesitated, but each attacked it ravenously. To the great\namazement of the geographer, a general grimace accompanied by a \"pwah!\"\nfollowed the first mouthful.\n\n\"It is horrible!\" said one.\n\n\"It is not eatable!\" replied another.\n\nThe poor geographer, whatever was the difficulty, was forced to agree\nthat this steak was not acceptable even to starving men. They therefore\nbegan to launch jokes at him, and deride his \"dish for the gods,\" while\nhe himself sought a reason for this unaccountable result.\n\n\"I have it!\" he cried. \"I have it!\"\n\n\"Is the meat too old?\" asked MacNabb, calmly.\n\n\"No, my intolerant major; but it has traveled too much. How could I\nforget that?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Tom Austin.\n\n\"I mean that the animal is not good unless killed when at rest. I\ncan affirm from the taste that it has come from a distance, and,\nconsequently, the whole herd.\"\n\n\"You are certain of this?\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\"Absolutely so.\"\n\n\"But what event could have terrified these animals so, and driven them\nat a time when they ought to be peacefully sleeping in their lairs.\"\n\n\"As to that, my dear Glenarvan,\" said Paganel, \"it is impossible for me\nto say. If you believe me, let us search no farther. For my part I am\ndying for want of sleep. Let us retire, major!\"\n\n\"Very well, Paganel.\"\n\nThereupon each wrapped himself in his poncho, the fuel was replenished\nfor the night, and soon all but Glenarvan were buried in profound\nrepose.\n\nHe alone did not sleep. A secret uneasiness held him in a state of\nwakeful fatigue. He could not help thinking of that herd, flying in one\ncommon direction, of their inexplicable terror. They could not have\nbeen pursued by wild beasts: at that height there were scarcely any,\nand yet fewer hunters. What fright had driven them over the abysses\nof Antuco, and what was the cause of it? He thought of their strange\nsituation, and felt a presentiment of coming danger.\n\nHowever, under the influence of a partial drowsiness, his ideas\ngradually modified, and fear gave place to hope. He saw himself in\nanticipation, on the morrow, on the plain at the foot of the Andes.\nThere his actual search was to begin; and success was not, perhaps, far\ndistant. He thought of Captain Grant and his two sailors, delivered\nfrom a cruel slavery.\n\nThese images passed rapidly before his mind, every instant interrupted\nby a flash of fire, a spark, a flame, illumining the faces of his\nsleeping companions, and casting a flickering shadow over the walls of\nthe hut. Then his presentiments returned with more vividness, while\nhe listened vaguely to the external sounds so difficult to explain on\nthese solitary summits.\n\nAt one moment he thought he heard distant rumblings, dull and\nthreatening like the rollings of thunder. These sounds could be caused\nonly by a tempest, raging on the sides of the mountain. He wished to\nconvince himself, and left the hut.\n\nThe moon had risen, and the sky was clear and calm. Not a cloud was to\nbe seen either above or below, only now and then the moving shadows of\nthe flames of the volcano. At the zenith twinkled thousands of stars,\nwhile the rumblings still continued. They seemed to approach, and run\nalong the chain of the mountains.\n\n[Illustration: The internal rumblings, the din of the avalanche, the\ncrash of the blocks of granite, and the whirlwinds of snow, rendered\nall communication with each other impossible.]\n\nGlenarvan returned more uneasy than before, seeking to divine what\nrelation there was between these subterranean noises and the flight of"}, {"chunk_id": 62, "text": "arvan, Robert, and Thalcave had yielded to the common law, and,\nstretched on their thick beds of grass, they enjoyed a refreshing\nsleep. The horses, overcome with fatigue, had lain down on the ground:\nThaouka alone, like a true blooded horse, slept standing, spirited in\nrepose as in action, and ready to start at the least sign from his\nmaster. Perfect tranquillity reigned within the inclosure, and the\nembers of the night-fire, as they gradually died out, cast their last\nrays over the silent obscurity.\n\nAbout ten o'clock, after a short sleep, the Indian awoke. His eyes\nbecame fixed beneath his lowered eyebrows, and his head was turned in a\nlistening attitude towards the plain. He seemed endeavoring to detect\nsome scarcely perceptible sound. A vague uneasiness was soon expressed\non his face, usually so calm. Had he perceived the approach of prowling\nIndians, or the coming of jaguars, water-tigers, and other formidable\nbeasts which are numerous in the neighborhood of rivers? This last\npossibility doubtless appeared plausible to him, for he cast a rapid\nglance over the combustible materials piled in the inclosure, and his\nanxiety increased. In fact, all this dry bedding would quickly be\nconsumed, and could not long intimidate the audacious animals.\n\nAccording to this conjecture, Thalcave had only to await the progress\nof events, which he did, half reclining, his head resting on his hands,\nhis elbows on his knees, his eyes motionless, in the attitude of a man\nwhom a sudden anxiety has awakened from sleep.\n\nAn hour passed. Any other person but Thalcave, reassured by the outward\nsilence, would have lain down again. But where a stranger would have\nsuspected nothing, the highly-trained senses and natural instinct of\nthe Indian foresaw the coming danger.\n\nWhile he was listening and watching, Thaouka gave a low neigh. His\nnose was stretched towards the entrance to the ramada. The Patagonian\nsuddenly started.\n\n\"Thaouka has scented some enemy,\" said he.\n\nHe arose and scanned the plain attentively. Silence still reigned, but\nnot tranquillity. Thalcave discerned shadows moving noiselessly among\nthe tufts of grass. Here and there glittered luminous points, which\nspread on all sides, now fading away, and now gleaming forth again. You\nwould have thought fantastic elves were dancing on the surface of an\nimmense lagoon. A stranger would doubtless have taken these flitting\nsparks for glow-worms, which shine, when night comes, in many parts of\nthe Pampas. But Thalcave was not deceived; he knew with what enemies he\nhad to deal. He loaded his carbine, and took a position near the first\nstakes of the inclosure.\n\nHe did not wait long. A strange cry, a mingling of barks and howls,\nresounded over the plain. The report of the carbine answered it,\nand was followed by a hundred frightful yelps. Glenarvan and Robert\nsuddenly awoke.\n\n[Sidenote: FEARFUL ODDS.]\n\n\"What is the matter?\" asked Robert.\n\n\"Indians?\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\"No,\" replied Thalcave, \"aguaras.\"\n\nRobert looked at Glenarvan.\n\n\"Aguaras?\" said he.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Glenarvan, \"the red wolves of the Pampas.\"\n\nBoth seized their weapons, and joined the Indian. The latter pointed\nto the plain, from which arose a series of formidable howls. Robert\ninvoluntarily took a step backward.\n\n\"You are not afraid of the wolves, my boy?\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\"No, my lord,\" replied Robert, in a firm tone. \"With you I fear\nnothing.\"\n\n\"So much the better. These aguaras are not very formidable beasts; and\nwere it not for their numbers I should not even think of them.\"\n\n\"What does it matter?\" replied Robert. \"We are well armed. Let them\ncome.\"\n\n\"And they shall be well received.\"\n\nSpeaking thus, Glenarvan endeavored to reassure the lad; but he did\nnot think without a secret terror of that dense horde of exasperated\nbeasts. Perhaps there were hundreds of them; and these three, however\nwell armed, could not advantageously contend against so many and such\nantagonists.\n\nBy the howls that resounded over the Pampas, and by the multi"}]}

He allowed this bloody orgy an hour to reach its utmost\nintensity. The last act of the funeral was played with the usual rites.\n\nThe bodies of Kara-Tété and his wife were taken up, and their limbs\nbent and gathered against the stomach, according to the New Zealand\ncustom. The place for the tomb had been chosen outside of the\nfortification, about two miles distant, on the summit of a small\nmountain, called Maunganamu, situated on the right shore of the lake.\n\nThither the bodies were to be carried. Two very rude palanquins, or\nrather litters, were brought to the foot of the mound. The corpses,\nfolded together, in a sitting posture, and tied in their clothes by a\ngirdle of withes, were placed on this primitive bier. Four warriors\nbore it between them, and the entire tribe, chanting the funeral hymn,\nfollowed them in procession to the place of burial.\n\nThe captives, who were always watched, saw them leave the inner\ninclosure of the pah, and then the songs and cries gradually died away.\nFor about half an hour this funeral escort continued in sight, in the\ndepths of the valley. Finally they perceived it again winding along\nthe mountain paths. The distance gave a fantastic appearance to the\nundulating movements of the long, sinuous column.\n\nThe tribe stopped at the summit of the mountain, which was eight\nhundred feet high, at the place prepared for Kara-Tété's interment.\nA common Maori would have had only a hole and a heap of stones for a\ngrave; but for a powerful and dreaded chief, destined doubtless for a\nspeedy deification, a tomb worthy of his exploits was reserved.\n\n[Sidenote: THE LAST NIGHT.]\n\nThe sepulchre had been surrounded by palisades, while stakes,\nornamented with faces reddened with ochre, stood beside the grave\nwhere the bodies were to lie. The relatives had not forgotten that the\n\"waidoua\" (the spirit of the dead) feeds on substantial nourishment\nlike the body during this perishable life. Food had therefore been\ndeposited in the inclosure, together with the weapons and clothes of\nthe deceased.\n\nNothing was wanting for the comfort of the tomb.

They were not to leave it again until the\nsummit of the Wahiti mountains should kindle with the first beams of\nthe day. One night remained to prepare for death. In spite of the\nfaintness, in spite of the horror with which they were seized, they\nshared their repast in common.\n\n\"We shall need all the strength possible to face death,\" said\nGlenarvan. \"We must show these barbarians how Europeans and Christians\ncan die.\"\n\nThe meal being finished, Lady Helena repeated the evening prayer aloud,\nwhile all her companions, with uncovered heads, joined her. Having\nfulfilled this duty, and enjoyed this privilege, the prisoners embraced\neach other. Lady Helena and Mary Grant then retired to one corner of\nthe hut, and stretched themselves upon a mat. Sleep, which soothes all\nwoes, soon closed their eyes, and they slumbered in each other's arms,\novercome by fatigue and long wakefulness.\n\nGlenarvan, taking his friends aside, said:\n\n\"My dear companions, our lives and those of these poor ladies are in\nGod's hands.

A rope with a slip-noose\nconfined his tail and paralyzed his movements. A few moments afterward\nhe was hauled over the ratlings, and precipitated upon the deck of the\nyacht. One of the sailors at once approached him, not without caution,\nand with a vigorous blow of the hatchet cut off the formidable tail of\nthe animal.\n\nThe chase was ended, and there was nothing more to fear from the\nmonster. The vengeance of the sailors was satisfied, but not their\ncuriosity. Indeed, it is customary on board of every vessel to\ncarefully examine the stomachs of sharks. The men, knowing the\ninordinate voracity of the creature, wait with some anxiety, and their\nexpectation is not always in vain.\n\nLady Glenarvan, not wishing to witness this strange \"exploration,\"\nretired to the cabin. The shark was still panting. He was ten feet\nlong, and weighed more than six hundred pounds. These dimensions are\nnothing extraordinary; for if the balance-fish is not classed among the\ngiants of this species, at least he belongs to the most formidable of\ntheir family.\n\nThe enormous fish was soon cut open by a blow of the hatchet, without\nfurther ceremony. The hook had penetrated to the stomach, which was\nabsolutely empty. Evidently the animal had fasted a long time, and\nthe disappointed seamen were about to cast the remains into the sea,\nwhen the attention of the mate was attracted by a bulky object firmly\nimbedded in the viscera.\n\n\"Ha! what is this?\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"That,\" replied one of the sailors, \"is a piece of rock that the\ncreature has taken in for ballast.\"\n\n\"Good!\" said another; \"it is probably a bullet that this fellow has\nreceived in the stomach, and could not digest.\"\n\n[Illustration: \"Good,\" said Glenarvan; \"wash the dirty thing, and bring\nit into the cabin.\"]\n\n\"Be still, all of you!\" cried Tom Austin, the mate; \"do you not see\nthat the animal was a great drunkard? and to lose nothing, has drank\nnot only the wine, but the bottle too!\"\n\n\"What!\" exclaimed Lord Glenarvan, \"is it a bottle that this shark has\nin his stomach?\"\n\n\"A real bottle!\" replied the mate, \"but you can easily see that it does\nnot come from the wine-cellar.\"\n\n\"Well, Tom,\" said Glenarvan, \"draw it out carefully.

I do not contradict you,\" replied the major. \"Perhaps there may be\na secret in this.\"\n\n\"We shall see,\" said Glenarvan. \"Well, Tom?\"\n\n\"Here it is,\" said the mate, displaying the shapeless object that he\nhad just drawn with difficulty from the interior of the shark.\n\n\"Good,\" said Glenarvan; \"wash the dirty thing, and bring it into the\ncabin.\"\n\nTom obeyed; and the bottle found under such singular circumstances was\nplaced on the cabin-table, around which Lord Glenarvan, Major MacNabb,\nand Captain John Mangles took their seats, together with Lady Helena;\nfor a woman, they say, is always a little inquisitive.\n\nEverything causes excitement at sea. For a moment there was silence.\nEach gazed wonderingly at this strange waif. Did it contain the secret\nof a disaster, or only an insignificant message confided to the mercy\nof the waves by some idle navigator?\n\n[Sidenote: \"OLD IN BOTTLE.\"]\n\nHowever, they must know what it was, and Glenarvan, without waiting\nlonger, proceeded to examine the bottle. He took, moreover, all\nnecessary precautions. You would have thought a coroner was pointing\nout the particulars of a suspicious quest. And Glenarvan was right,\nfor the most insignificant mark in appearance may often lead to an\nimportant discovery.\n\nBefore examining it internally, the bottle was inspected externally.\nIt had a slender neck, the mouth of which was protected by an\niron wire considerably rusted. Its sides were very thick, and\ncapable of supporting a pressure of several atmospheres, betraying\nevidently previous connection with champagne.

Three dogs of wild appearance were\nstretched at their feet. The eight rowers seemed to be servants or\nslaves of the chief. They worked vigorously, and the boat ascended the\ncurrent of the Waikato with remarkable swiftness.\n\nIn the centre of this long canoe, with feet tied, but hands free, were\nten European prisoners clinging closely to each other. They were Lord\nGlenarvan and his companions.\n\n[Sidenote: A TESTING TIME.]\n\nThe evening before, the little party, led astray by the dense fog, had\nencamped in the midst of a numerous tribe of natives. About midnight,\nthe travelers, surprised in their sleep, were made prisoners and\ncarried on board the canoe. They had not yet been maltreated, but had\ntried in vain to resist. Their arms and ammunition were in the hands of\nthe savages, and their own bullets would have quickly stretched them on\nthe earth had they attempted to escape.\n\nThey were not long in learning, by the aid of a few English words which\nthe natives used, that, being driven back by the British troops, they\nwere returning, vanquished and weakened, to the regions of the upper\nWaikato. Their chief, after an obstinate resistance, in which he lost\nhis principal warriors, was now on his way to rouse again the river\ntribes. He was called Kai-Koumou, a terrible name, which signified\nin the native language \"he who eats the limbs of his enemy.\" He was\nbrave and bold, but his cruelty equaled his bravery. No pity could be\nexpected from him. His name was well known to the English soldiers, and\na price had been set upon his head by the governor of New Zealand.\n\nThis terrible catastrophe had come upon Glenarvan just as he was\nabout reaching the long-desired harbor of Auckland, whence he would\nhave returned to his native country. Yet, looking at his calm and\npassionless countenance, you could not have divined the depth of his\nanguish, for in his present critical situation he did not betray the\nextent of his misfortunes. He felt that he ought to set an example of\nfortitude to his wife and his companions, as being the husband and\nchief. Moreover, he was ready to die first for the common safety, if\ncircumstances should require it.\n\n[Sidenote: CHIEFS, CIVILIZED AND UNCIVILIZED.]\n\nHis companions were worthy of him; they shared his noble thoughts, and\ntheir calm and haughty appearance would scarcely have intimated that\nthey were being carried away to captivity and suffering. By common\nconsent, at Glenarvan's suggestion, they had resolved to feign a proud\nindifference in the presence of the savages. It was the only way of\ninfluencing those fierce natures.\n\n[Illustration: A boat might have been seen ascending the Waikato. It\nwas a canoe seventy feet long and five broad.]\n\nSince leaving the encampment, the natives, taciturn like all savages,\nhad scarcely spoken to each other. However, from a few words exchanged,\nGlenarvan perceived that they were acquainted with the English\nlanguage. He therefore resolved to question the chief in regard to the\nfate that was in store for them. Addressing Kai-Koumou, he said, in a\nfearless tone:\n\n\"Where are you taking us, chief?\"\n\nKai-Koumou gazed at him coldly without answering.\n\n\"Say, what do you expect to do with us?\" continued Glenarvan.\n\nThe chief's eyes blazed with a sudden light, and in a stern voice he\nreplied:\n\n\"To exchange you, if your friends will ransom you; to kill you, if they\nrefuse.\"\n\nGlenarvan asked no more, but hope returned to his heart. Doubtless,\nsome chiefs of the Maori tribe had fallen into the hands of the\nEnglish, and the natives would attempt to recover them by way of\nexchange; their situation, therefore, was not one for despair.\n\nMeantime the canoe rapidly ascended the river. Paganel, whose\nchangeable disposition carried him from one extreme to another, had\nregained his hopefulness.

Kai-Koumou came out of his house, and, surrounded by\nthe principal warriors of his tribe, took his place on a mound several\nfeet high in the centre of the fortification. The crowd of natives\nformed a semicircle around him, and the whole assembly preserved\nabsolute silence.\n\nAt a sign from the chief, a warrior advanced towards the temple.\n\n\"Remember!\" said Lady Helena to her husband.\n\nGlenarvan clasped his wife to his heart. At this moment Mary Grant\napproached John Mangles.\n\n\"Lord and Lady Glenarvan,\" said she, \"I think that, if a wife can die\nby the hand of her husband to escape a degrading existence, a maiden\ncan likewise die by the hand of her lover. John (for I may tell you\nat this critical moment), have I not long been your betrothed in the\ndepths of your heart? May I rely upon you, dear John, as Lady Helena\ndoes upon Lord Glenarvan?\"\n\n\"Mary!\" cried the young captain, in terror. \"Ah! dear Mary----\"\n\nHe could not finish: the mat was raised, and the captives were dragged\ntowards Kai-Koumou. The two women were resigned to their fate, while\nthe men concealed their anguish beneath a calmness that showed\nsuperhuman self-control. They came before the chief, who did not delay\nsentence.\n\n\"You killed Kara-Tété!\" said he to Glenarvan.\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n[Sidenote: THE BEGINNING OF THE END.]\n\n\"You shall die to-morrow at sunrise.\"\n\n\"Alone?\" inquired Glenarvan, whose heart beat quickly.\n\n\"What! as if our Tohonga's life were not more precious than yours!\"\ncried Kai-Koumou, whose eyes expressed a fierce regret.\n\nAt this moment a commotion took place among the natives. Glenarvan cast\na rapid glance around him. The crowd opened, and a warrior, dripping\nwith sweat and overcome with fatigue, appeared.\n\nAs soon as Kai-Koumou perceived him, he said in English, evidently that\nhe might be understood by the captives:\n\n\"You come from the camp of the pale-faces?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the Maori.\n\n\"You saw the prisoner, our Tohonga?\"\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n\"Is he living?\"\n\n\"He is dead! The English have shot him.\"\n\nThe fate of Glenarvan and his companions was settled.\n\n\"You shall all die to-morrow at daybreak!\" cried Kai-Koumou.\n\nThe unfortunates were therefore to suffer a common death. Lady Helena\nand Mary Grant raised towards heaven a look of thankfulness.\n\nThe captives were not taken back to the temple. They were to attend\nthat day the funeral of the dead chief, and the bloody ceremonies\nconnected therewith. A party of natives conducted them to the foot of\nan enormous koudi, where these guardians remained without losing sight\nof their prisoners. The rest of the tribe, absorbed in their official\nmourning, seemed to have forgotten them.\n\nThe customary three days had elapsed since the death of Kara-Tété. The\nsoul of the deceased had therefore forever abandoned its mortal abode.\nThe sacred rites began.\n\nThe body was carried to a small mound in the centre of the\nfortification, clothed in splendid costume, and enveloped in a\nmagnificent flaxen mat. The head was adorned with plumes, and wore a\ncrown of green leaves. The face, arms, and breast had been rubbed with\noil, and therefore showed no mortification.\n\nThe parents and friends of the deceased came to the foot of the\nmound, and all at once, as if some director were beating time to a\nfuneral dirge, a great concert of cries, groans, and sobs arose on the\nair. They mourned the dead in plaintive and modulated cadences. His\nrelations struck their heads together; his kinswomen lacerated their\nfaces with their nails, and showed themselves more lavish of blood than\nof tears. These unfortunate females conscientiously fulfilled their\nbarbarous duty.\n\nBut these demonstrations were not enough to appease the soul of the\ndeceased, whose wrath would doubtless hav"}, {"chunk_id": 193, "text": "\"\ncried he.]\n\nAt last his voice rose above the tumult.\n\n\"Taboo! taboo!\" cried he.\n\nAt this word the crowd fell back before Glenarvan and his companions,\nthus temporarily preserved by a supernatural power. A few moments after\nthey were led back to the temple that served as their prison; but\nRobert Grant and Paganel were no longer with them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER L.\n\nTHE CHIEF'S FUNERAL.\n\n\nKai-Koumou, according to a custom quite ordinary in New Zealand, joined\nthe rank of priest to that of chief, and could, therefore, extend to\npersons or objects the superstitious protection of the taboo.\n\nThe taboo, which is common to the tribes of Polynesia, has the power\nto prohibit at once all connection with the object or person tabooed.\nAccording to the Maori religion, whoever should lay his sacrilegious\nhand on what is declared taboo would be punished with death by the\noffended god; and in case the divinity should delay to avenge his own\ninsult, the priests would not fail to excite his anger.\n\nAs for the prisoners confined in the temple, the taboo had rescued\nthem from the fury of the tribe. Some of the natives, the friends and\npartisans of Kai-Koumou, had stopped suddenly at the command of their\nchief, and had protected the captives.\n\n[Sidenote: THE TORTURES OF SUSPENSE.]\n\nGlenarvan, however, was not blind to the fate that was reserved for\nhim. Only his death could atone for the murder of a chief. Among savage\nraces death is always preceded by a protracted torture. He therefore\nexpected to cruelly expiate the righteous indignation that had nerved\nhis arm, but hoped that Kai-Koumou's rage would fall only on himself.\n\nWhat a night he and his companions passed! Who could depict their\nanguish, or measure their sufferings? Neither poor Robert nor brave\nPaganel had reappeared. But how could they doubt their fate? Were they\nnot the first victims of the natives' vengeance? All hope had vanished\neven from the heart of the major, who did not easily despair. John\nMangles felt himself growing mad at sight of the sad dejection of Mary\nGrant, thus separated from her brother. Glenarvan thought of that\nterrible request of Lady Helena, who, rather than yield to torture or\nslavery, preferred to die by his hand. Could he summon this fearful\ncourage? As for an escape, that was plainly impossible. Ten warriors,\narmed to the teeth, guarded the entrance of the temple.\n\nMorning came at last. There had been no communication between the\nnatives and the prisoners. The hut contained a considerable quantity\nof food, which the unfortunates scarcely touched. Hunger gave place to\ngrief. The day passed without bringing a change or a hope. Doubtless\nthe hour for the dead chief's funeral and their torture would be the\nsame.\n\nHowever, although Glenarvan concluded that Kai-Koumou must have\nabandoned all idea of exchange, the major on this point retained a\ngleam of hope.\n\n\"Who knows,\" said he, reminding Glenarvan of the effect produced upon\nthe chief by the death of Kara-Tété,--\"who knows but that Kai-Koumou in\nreality feels obliged to you?\"\n\nBut, in spite of these observations, Glenarvan would no longer hope.\nThe next day also passed away without the preparations for torture\nbeing made. The reason of the delay was this.\n\nThe Maoris believe that the soul, for three days after death, inhabits\nthe body of the deceased, and therefore during this time the corpse\nremains unburied. This custom was rigorously observed, and for two days\nthe pah was deserted. Captain Mangles frequently stood on Wilson's\nshoulders and surveyed the fortification. No native was seen; only the\nsentinels guarded in turn at the door of their prison.\n\nBut on the third day the huts were opened. The savages, men, women,\nand children, to the number of several hundreds, assembled in the pah,\nsilent and calm. Kai-Koumou came out of his house, and, surrounded by\nthe principal warriors of his tribe, took his place on a mound several\nfeet high in the centre of the fortification.

They were Lord\nGlenarvan and his companions.\n\n[Sidenote: A TESTING TIME.]\n\nThe evening before, the little party, led astray by the dense fog, had\nencamped in the midst of a numerous tribe of natives. About midnight,\nthe travelers, surprised in their sleep, were made prisoners and\ncarried on board the canoe. They had not yet been maltreated, but had\ntried in vain to resist. Their arms and ammunition were in the hands of\nthe savages, and their own bullets would have quickly stretched them on\nthe earth had they attempted to escape.\n\nThey were not long in learning, by the aid of a few English words which\nthe natives used, that, being driven back by the British troops, they\nwere returning, vanquished and weakened, to the regions of the upper\nWaikato. Their chief, after an obstinate resistance, in which he lost\nhis principal warriors, was now on his way to rouse again the river\ntribes. He was called Kai-Koumou, a terrible name, which signified\nin the native language \"he who eats the limbs of his enemy.\" He was\nbrave and bold, but his cruelty equaled his bravery. No pity could be\nexpected from him. His name was well known to the English soldiers, and\na price had been set upon his head by the governor of New Zealand.\n\nThis terrible catastrophe had come upon Glenarvan just as he was\nabout reaching the long-desired harbor of Auckland, whence he would\nhave returned to his native country. Yet, looking at his calm and\npassionless countenance, you could not have divined the depth of his\nanguish, for in his present critical situation he did not betray the\nextent of his misfortunes. He felt that he ought to set an example of\nfortitude to his wife and his companions, as being the husband and\nchief. Moreover, he was ready to die first for the common safety, if\ncircumstances should require it.\n\n[Sidenote: CHIEFS, CIVILIZED AND UNCIVILIZED.]\n\nHis companions were worthy of him; they shared his noble thoughts, and\ntheir calm and haughty appearance would scarcely have intimated that\nthey were being carried away to captivity and suffering. By common\nconsent, at Glenarvan's suggestion, they had resolved to feign a proud\nindifference in the presence of the savages. It was the only way of\ninfluencing those fierce natures.\n\n[Illustration: A boat might have been seen ascending the Waikato. It\nwas a canoe seventy feet long and five broad.]\n\nSince leaving the encampment, the natives, taciturn like all savages,\nhad scarcely spoken to each other. However, from a few words exchanged,\nGlenarvan perceived that they were acquainted with the English\nlanguage. He therefore resolved to question the chief in regard to the\nfate that was in store for them. Addressing Kai-Koumou, he said, in a\nfearless tone:\n\n\"Where are you taking us, chief?\"\n\nKai-Koumou gazed at him coldly without answering.\n\n\"Say, what do you expect to do with us?\" continued Glenarvan.\n\nThe chief's eyes blazed with a sudden light, and in a stern voice he\nreplied:\n\n\"To exchange you, if your friends will ransom you; to kill you, if they\nrefuse.\"\n\nGlenarvan asked no more, but hope returned to his heart. Doubtless,\nsome chiefs of the Maori tribe had fallen into the hands of the\nEnglish, and the natives would attempt to recover them by way of\nexchange; their situation, therefore, was not one for despair.\n\nMeantime the canoe rapidly ascended the river. Paganel, whose\nchangeable disposition carried him from one extreme to another, had\nregained his hopefulness. He believed that the Maoris were sparing them\nthe fatigue of their journey to the English settlements, a"}, {"chunk_id": 45, "text": "han two minutes.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said MacNabb; \"and was Robert on your right, or on your left?\"\n\n\"On my left. I remember that his poncho flapped in my face.\"\n\n\"And where were you situated in reference to us?\"\n\n\"On the left also.\"\n\n\"Then Robert could have disappeared only on this side,\" said the major,\nturning towards the mountain, and pointing to the right. \"And also\nconsidering the time that has elapsed since his disappearance, the\nchild must have fallen at a high part of the mountain. There we must\nsearch, and, by taking different ways, we shall find him.\"\n\nNot a word more was said. The six men, scaling the declivities of the\nmountain, stationed themselves at different heights along the ridge,\nand began their search. They kept always to the right of their line of\ndescent, sounding the smallest fissures, descending to the bottom of\nprecipices half filled with fragments of the mass; and more than one\ncame forth with his garments in shreds, his feet and hands lacerated,\nat the peril of his life.\n\n[Sidenote: A SLEEPLESS NIGHT.]\n\nAll this portion of the Andes, except a few inaccessible plateaus,\nwas carefully explored for many hours without one of these brave men\nthinking of rest. But it was a vain search. The child had not only\nfound death in the mountains, but also a tomb, the stone of which,\nmade of some enormous rock, was forever closed over him.\n\nTowards noon Glenarvan and his companions, bruised and exhausted, found\nthemselves again in the valley. The former was a prey to the most\nviolent grief. He scarcely spoke, and from his lips issued only these\nwords, broken by sighs,--\"I will not go; I will not go!\"\n\nEach understood this determination, and respected it.\n\n\"We will wait,\" said Paganel to the major and Tom Austin. \"Let us take\nsome rest, and recruit our strength. We shall need it, whether to begin\nour search or continue our journey.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied MacNabb, \"let us remain, since Edward wishes it. He\nhopes: but what does he hope?\"\n\n\"God knows!\" said Tom Austin.\n\n\"Poor Robert!\" replied Paganel, wiping his eyes.\n\nTrees thronged the valley in great numbers. The major chose a group of\nlofty carob-trees, under which was established a temporary encampment.\nA few blankets, the arms, a little dried meat, and some rice, was\nall that remained to the travelers. A stream, which flowed not far\noff, furnished water, still muddy from the effects of the avalanche.\nMulready kindled a fire on the grass, and soon presented to his master\na warm and comforting repast. But Glenarvan refused it, and remained\nstretched on his poncho in profound prostration.\n\nThus the day passed. Night came, clear and calm as the preceding. While\nhis companions lay motionless, although wakeful, Glenarvan reascended\nthe mountain. He listened closely, still hoping that a last cry might\nreach him. He ventured alone and afar, pressing his ear to the ground,\nlistening, restraining the beatings of his heart, and calling in a\nvoice of despair.\n\nThe whole night long he wandered on the mountain. Sometimes Paganel,\nsometimes the major, followed him, ready to help him on the slippery\nsummits, or on the edge of the chasms, where his rashness led him. But\nhis last efforts were fruitless; and to the cry of \"Robert! Robert!\" a\nthousand times repeated, echo alone replied.\n\nDay dawned, and it was necessary to go in search of Glenarvan on\nthe mountain, and bring him in spite of his reluctance back to the\nencampment. His despair was terrible. Who would now dare to speak\nto him of departure, and propose leaving this fatal valley? But the\nprovisions were failing. They would soon meet the Argentine guides\nand horses to take them across the Pampas. To retrace their steps was\nmore difficult than to advance. Besides, the Atlantic was the place\nappointed to meet the Duncan. All these reasons did not permit a longer\ndelay, and it was for the interest of all that the hour for departure\nshould be no longer deferred.\n\nMacNabb attempted to draw Glenarvan from his grief.

Moreover,\nthe unfortunate woman would not have been allowed to survive him;\nit was the custom, in accordance with duty, and examples of such\nsacrifices are not wanting in New Zealand history. The woman appeared.\nShe was still young. Her hair floated in disorder over her shoulders.\nVague words, lamentations, and broken phrases, in which she celebrated\nthe virtues of the dead, interrupted her groans; and, in a final\nparoxysm of grief, she stretched herself at the foot of the mound,\nbeating the ground with her head.\n\nAt this moment Kai-Koumou approached her. Suddenly the unfortunate\nvictim rose; but a violent blow with the \"méré,\" a formidable club,\nwielded by the hand of the chief, struck her lifeless to the earth.\n\n[Sidenote: POOR HUMANITY!]\n\nFrightful cries at once broke forth. A hundred arms threatened the\ncaptives, who trembled at the horrible sight. But no one stirred, for\nthe funeral ceremonies were not ended.\n\nKara-Tété's wife had joined her husband in the other world. Both bodies\nlay side by side. But for the eternal life his faithful spouse could\nnot alone suffice the deceased. Who would serve them in presence of\nNouï-Atoua, if their slaves did not follow them?\n\nSix unfortunates were brought before the corpse of their master and\nmistress. They were servants, whom the pitiless laws of war had reduced\nto slavery. During the life of the chief they had undergone the\nseverest privations, suffered a thousand abuses, had been scantily fed,\nand compelled constantly to labor like beasts; and now, according to\nthe Maori belief, they were to continue their existence of servitude\nfor eternity.\n\nThey appeared to be resigned to their fate, and were not astonished\nat a sacrifice they had long anticipated. Their freedom from all\nbonds showed that they would meet death unresistingly. Moreover, this\ndeath was rapid, protracted sufferings were spared them. These were\nreserved for the captives who stood trembling not twenty paces distant.\nSix blows of the méré, given by six stalwart warriors, stretched the\nvictims on the ground in a pool of blood. It was the signal for a\nterrible scene of cannibalism, which followed in all its horrible\ndetails.\n\nGlenarvan and his companions, breathless with fright, strove to hide\nthis awful scene from the eyes of the two unhappy ladies. They now\nunderstood what awaited them at sunrise the next day, and what cruel\ntortures would doubtless precede such a death. They were dumb with\nhorror.\n\nThe funeral dance now began. Strong spirits, extracted from an\nindigenous plant, maddened the savages till they seemed no longer\nhuman. Would they not forget the taboo of the chief, and throw\nthemselves in their final outbreaks upon the prisoners who trembled at\ntheir frenzy?\n\n[Illustration: A terrible scene of cannibalism, which followed in all\nits horrible details.]\n\n[Illustration: The corpses, folded together, in a sitting posture,\nand tied in their clothes by a girdle of withes, were placed on this\nprimitive bier.]\n\nBut Kai-Koumou had preserved his reason in the midst of the general\nintoxication.

It was\nnecessary to use a hammer, for the stony covering had acquired the\nhardness of granite. The fragments soon strewed the table, and several\npieces of paper were perceived adhering to each other. Glenarvan drew\nthem out carefully, separating and examining them closely, while Lady\nHelena, the major, and the captain crowded around him.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nTHE THREE DOCUMENTS.\n\n\nThese pieces of paper, half destroyed by the sea-water, exhibited only\na few words, the traces of handwriting almost entirely effaced. For\nseveral minutes Lord Glenarvan examined them attentively, turned them\nabout in every way, and exposed them to the light of day, observing\nthe least traces of writing spared by the sea. Then he looked at his\nfriends, who were regarding him with anxious eyes.\n\n\"There are here,\" said he, \"three distinct documents, probably three\ncopies of the same missive, translated into three different languages:\none English, another French, and the third German. The few words that\nremain leave no doubt on this point.\"\n\n\"But these words have at least a meaning?\" said Lady Glenarvan.\n\n\"That is difficult to say, my dear Helena. The words traced on these\npapers are very imperfect.\"\n\n\"Perhaps they will complete each other,\" said the major.\n\n\"That may be,\" replied Captain Mangles. \"It is not probable that the\nwater has obliterated these lines in exactly the same places on each,\nand by comparing these remains of phrases we shall arrive at some\nintelligible meaning.\"\n\n\"We will do so,\" said Lord Glenarvan; \"but let us proceed\nsystematically. And, first, here is the English document.\"\n\nIt showed the following arrangement of lines and words:\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"That does not mean much,\" said the major, with an air of\ndisappointment.\n\n\"Whatever it may mean,\" replied the captain, \"it is good English.\"\n\n\"There is no doubt of that,\" said his lordship. \"The words _wreck,\naland, this, and, lost_, are perfect. _Cap_ evidently means _captain_,\nreferring to the captain of a shipwrecked vessel.\"\n\n\"Let us add,\" said the captain, \"the portions of the words _docu_ and\n_ssistance_, the meaning of which is plain.\"\n\n\"Well, something is gained already!\" added Lady Helena.\n\n\"Unfortunately,\" replied the major, \"entire lines are wanting. How can\nwe find the name of the lost vessel, or the place of shipwreck?\"\n\n\"We shall find them,\" said Lord Edward.\n\n\"Very likely,\" answered the major, who was invariably of the opinion of\nevery one else; \"but how?\"\n\n\"By comparing one document with another.\"\n\n\"Let us see!\" cried Lady Helena.\n\nThe second piece of paper, more damaged than the former, exhibited only\nisolated words, arranged thus:\n\n[Sidenote: COMPARATIVE PHILOLOGY.]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"This is written in German,\" said Captain Mangles, when he had cast his\neyes upon it.\n\n\"And do you know that language?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"Perfectly, your lordship.\"\n\n\"Well, tell us what these few words mean.\"\n\nThe captain examined the document closely, and expressed himself as\nfollows:\n\n\"First, the date of the event is determined. _7 Juni_ means June 7th,\nand by comparing this figure with the figures '62,' furnished by the\nEnglish document, we have the date complete,--June 7th, 1862.\"\n\n\"Very well!\" exclaimed Lady Helena. \"Go on.\"\n\n\"On the same line,\" continued the young captain, \"I find the word\n_Glas_, which, united with the word _gow_ of the first document, gives\n_Glasgow_. It is plainly a ship from the port of Glasgow.\"\n\n\"That was my opinion,\" said the major.\n\n\"The second line is missing entirely,\" continued Captain Mangles; \"but\non the third I meet with two important words _zwei_, which means _two_,\nand _atrosen_, or rather _matrosen_, which signifies _sailors_ in\nGerman.\"\n\n\"There were a captain and two sailors, then?\" said Lady Helena.\n\n\"Probably,\" replied her husband.\n\n\"I will confess, your lordship,\" said the ca"}, {"chunk_id": 190, "text": "des,\nfifteen feet high. A second line of stakes, and then a fence of osiers,\npierced with loop-holes, inclosed the inner space, the court-yard of\nthe pah, in which stood several Maori tents, and forty huts which were\nsymmetrically arranged.\n\nOn their arrival, the captives were terribly impressed at sight of\nthe heads that ornamented the stakes of the second inclosure. Lady\nHelena and Mary Grant turned away their eyes with more of disgust than\nterror. These heads had most of them belonged to hostile chiefs, fallen\nin battle, whose bodies had served as food for the conquerors. The\ngeographer knew them to be such by their hollow and eyeless sockets!\n\nIn Kai-Koumou's pah only the heads of his enemies formed this frightful\nmuseum; and here, doubtless, more than one English skull had served to\nincrease the size of the chief's collection.\n\nHis hut, among those belonging to warriors of lower rank, stood at the\nrear of the pah, in front of a large open terrace. This structure was\nbuilt of stakes, interlaced with branches, and lined inside with flax\nmatting.\n\nOnly one opening gave access to the dwelling. A thick curtain, made\nof a vegetable tissue, served as a door. The roof projected so as to\nform a water-shed. Several faces, carved at the ends of the rafters,\nadorned the hut, and the curtain was covered with various imitations\nof foliage, symbolical figures, monsters, and graceful sculpturing,\na curious piece of work, fashioned by the scissors of the native\ndecorators.\n\n[Sidenote: FEMININE ORATORY.]\n\nInside of the habitation the floor was made of hard-trodden earth,\nand raised six inches above the ground. Several rush screens and some\nmattresses, covered with woven matting of long leaves and twigs,\nserved as beds. In the middle of the room a hole in a stone formed the\nfireplace, and another in the roof answered for a chimney.\n\nThe smoke, when it became sufficiently thick, perforce escaped at this\noutlet, but it of course blackened the walls of the house.\n\nOn one side of the hut were storehouses, containing the chief's\nprovisions, his harvest of flax, potatoes, and edible ferns, and\nthe ovens where the various articles of food were cooked by contact\nwith heated stones. Farther off, in small pens, pigs and goats were\nconfined, and dogs ran about seeking their scanty sustenance. They were\nrather poorly kept, for animals that formed the Maori daily food.\n\nGlenarvan and his companions had taken in the whole at a glance. They\nawaited beside an empty hut the good pleasure of the chief, exposed to\nthe insults of a crowd of old women, who surrounded them like harpies,\nand threatened them with their fists, crying and howling. Several\nEnglish words that passed their lips clearly indicated that they were\ndemanding immediate vengeance.\n\nIn the midst of these cries and threats, Lady Helena affected a\ncalmness that she could not feel in her heart. This courageous woman,\nin order that her husband's coolness might not forsake him, heroically\ncontrolled her emotions. Poor Mary Grant felt herself growing weak, and\nCaptain Mangles supported her, ready to die in her defence. The others\nendured this torrent of invectives in various ways, either indifferent\nlike the major, or increasingly annoyed like Paganel.\n\nGlenarvan, wishing to relieve Lady Helena from the assaults of these\nshrews, boldly approached Kai-Koumou, and, pointing to the hideous\nthrong, said:\n\n\"Drive them away!\"\n\nThe Maori chief gazed steadily at his prisoner without replying. Then\nwith a gesture he silenced the noisy horde. Glenarvan bowed in token of\nthanks, and slowly resumed his place among his friends.\n\nKai-Koumou, fearing an insurrection of the fanatics of his tribe, now\nled his captives to a sacred place, situated at the other end of the\npah, on the edge of a precipice.

Kai-Koumou seemed equally surprised.\n\n\"Then you doubt it?\" said he.\n\n\"I do not know,\" repeated Glenarvan.\n\n\"Will not your people accept you in exchange for our Tohonga?\"\n\n\"Not me alone,\" replied Glenarvan; \"but perhaps all of us.\"\n\n\"Among the Maoris,\" said Kai-Koumou, \"it is one for one.\"\n\n\"Offer these ladies first in exchange for your priest,\" answered\nGlenarvan, pointing to Lady Helena and Mary Grant. Lady Helena would\nhave rushed towards her husband, but the major restrained her.\n\n\"These two ladies,\" continued Glenarvan, turning respectfully towards\nthem, \"hold a high rank in their country.\"\n\nThe warrior glanced coldly at his prisoner. A malicious smile passed\nover his face; but he almost instantly repressed it, and replied, in a\nvoice which he could scarcely control:\n\n\"Do you hope, then, to deceive Kai-Koumou by false words, cursed\nEuropean? Do you think that Kai-Koumou's eyes cannot read your heart?\"\n\nThen, pointing to Lady Helena, he said:\n\n\"That is your wife!\"\n\n\"No, mine!\" cried Kara-Tété.\n\nThen, pushing back the prisoners, the chief laid his hand on Lady\nHelena's shoulder, who grew pale at the touch.\n\n\"Edward!\" cried the unfortunate woman, in terror.\n\nGlenarvan, without uttering a word, raised his arm. A report resounded.\nKara-Tété fell dead.\n\nAt this sound a crowd of natives issued from the huts. The pah was\nfilled in an instant. A hundred arms were raised against the captives.\nGlenarvan's revolver was snatched from his hand.\n\nKai-Koumou cast a strange look at Glenarvan, and then, guarding with\none hand the person of him who had fired, he controlled with the other\nthe throng that was rushing upon the Europeans.\n\n[Illustration: At last his voice rose above the tumult. \"Taboo! taboo!\"\ncried he.]\n\nAt last his voice rose above the tumult.\n\n\"Taboo! taboo!\" cried he.\n\nAt this word the crowd fell back before Glenarvan and his companions,\nthus temporarily preserved by a supernatural power.

It was\nnecessary to use a hammer, for the stony covering had acquired the\nhardness of granite. The fragments soon strewed the table, and several\npieces of paper were perceived adhering to each other. Glenarvan drew\nthem out carefully, separating and examining them closely, while Lady\nHelena, the major, and the captain crowded around him.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nTHE THREE DOCUMENTS.\n\n\nThese pieces of paper, half destroyed by the sea-water, exhibited only\na few words, the traces of handwriting almost entirely effaced. For\nseveral minutes Lord Glenarvan examined them attentively, turned them\nabout in every way, and exposed them to the light of day, observing\nthe least traces of writing spared by the sea. Then he looked at his\nfriends, who were regarding him with anxious eyes.\n\n\"There are here,\" said he, \"three distinct documents, probably three\ncopies of the same missive, translated into three different languages:\none English, another French, and the third German. The few words that\nremain leave no doubt on this point.\"\n\n\"But these words have at least a meaning?\" said Lady Glenarvan.\n\n\"That is difficult to say, my dear Helena. The words traced on these\npapers are very imperfect.\"\n\n\"Perhaps they will complete each other,\" said the major.\n\n\"That may be,\" replied Captain Mangles. \"It is not probable that the\nwater has obliterated these lines in exactly the same places on each,\nand by comparing these remains of phrases we shall arrive at some\nintelligible meaning.\"\n\n\"We will do so,\" said Lord Glenarvan; \"but let us proceed\nsystematically. And, first, here is the English document.\"\n\nIt showed the following arrangement of lines and words:\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"That does not mean much,\" said the major, with an air of\ndisappointment.\n\n\"Whatever it may mean,\" replied the captain, \"it is good English.\"\n\n\"There is no doubt of that,\" said his lordship. \"The words _wreck,\naland, this, and, lost_, are perfect. _Cap_ evidently means _captain_,\nreferring to the captain of a shipwrecked vessel.\"\n\n\"Let us add,\" said the captain, \"the portions of the words _docu_ and\n_ssistance_, the meaning of which is plain.\"\n\n\"Well, something is gained already!\" added Lady Helena.\n\n\"Unfortunately,\" replied the major, \"entire lines are wanting. How can\nwe find the name of the lost vessel, or the place of shipwreck?\"\n\n\"We shall find them,\" said Lord Edward.\n\n\"Very likely,\" answered the major, who was invariably of the opinion of\nevery one else; \"but how?\"\n\n\"By comparing one document with another.\"\n\n\"Let us see!\" cried Lady Helena.\n\nThe second piece of paper, more damaged than the former, exhibited only\nisolated words, arranged thus:\n\n[Sidenote: COMPARATIVE PHILOLOGY.]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"This is written in German,\" said Captain Mangles, when he had cast his\neyes upon it.\n\n\"And do you know that language?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"Perfectly, your lordship.\"\n\n\"Well, tell us what these few words mean.\"\n\nThe captain examined the document closely, and expressed himself as\nfollows:\n\n\"First, the date of the event is determined. _7 Juni_ means June 7th,\nand by comparing this figure with the figures '62,' furnished by the\nEnglish document, we have the date complete,--June 7th, 1862.\"\n\n\"Very well!\" exclaimed Lady Helena. \"Go on.\"\n\n\"On the same line,\" continued the young captain, \"I find the word\n_Glas_, which, united with the word _gow_ of the first document, gives\n_Glasgow_. It is plainly a ship from the port of Glasgow.\"\n\n\"That was my opinion,\" said the major.\n\n\"The second line is missing entirely,\" continued Captain Mangles; \"but\non the third I meet with two important words _zwei_, which means _two_,\nand _atrosen_, or rather _matrosen_, which signifies _sailors_ in\nGerman.\"\n\n\"There were a captain and two sailors, then?\" said Lady Helena.\n\n\"Probably,\" replied her husband.\n\n\"I will confess, your lordship,\" said the ca"}, {"chunk_id": 195, "text": "or were beating time to a\nfuneral dirge, a great concert of cries, groans, and sobs arose on the\nair. They mourned the dead in plaintive and modulated cadences. His\nrelations struck their heads together; his kinswomen lacerated their\nfaces with their nails, and showed themselves more lavish of blood than\nof tears. These unfortunate females conscientiously fulfilled their\nbarbarous duty.\n\nBut these demonstrations were not enough to appease the soul of the\ndeceased, whose wrath would doubtless have smitten the survivors of his\ntribe; and his warriors, as they could not recall him to life, wished\nthat he should have no cause to regret in the other world the happiness\nof this.\n\nKara-Tété's wife was not to forsake her husband in the tomb. Moreover,\nthe unfortunate woman would not have been allowed to survive him;\nit was the custom, in accordance with duty, and examples of such\nsacrifices are not wanting in New Zealand history. The woman appeared.\nShe was still young. Her hair floated in disorder over her shoulders.\nVague words, lamentations, and broken phrases, in which she celebrated\nthe virtues of the dead, interrupted her groans; and, in a final\nparoxysm of grief, she stretched herself at the foot of the mound,\nbeating the ground with her head.\n\nAt this moment Kai-Koumou approached her. Suddenly the unfortunate\nvictim rose; but a violent blow with the \"méré,\" a formidable club,\nwielded by the hand of the chief, struck her lifeless to the earth.\n\n[Sidenote: POOR HUMANITY!]\n\nFrightful cries at once broke forth. A hundred arms threatened the\ncaptives, who trembled at the horrible sight. But no one stirred, for\nthe funeral ceremonies were not ended.\n\nKara-Tété's wife had joined her husband in the other world. Both bodies\nlay side by side. But for the eternal life his faithful spouse could\nnot alone suffice the deceased. Who would serve them in presence of\nNouï-Atoua, if their slaves did not follow them?\n\nSix unfortunates were brought before the corpse of their master and\nmistress. They were servants, whom the pitiless laws of war had reduced\nto slavery. During the life of the chief they had undergone the\nseverest privations, suffered a thousand abuses, had been scantily fed,\nand compelled constantly to labor like beasts; and now, according to\nthe Maori belief, they were to continue their existence of servitude\nfor eternity.\n\nThey appeared to be resigned to their fate, and were not astonished\nat a sacrifice they had long anticipated. Their freedom from all\nbonds showed that they would meet death unresistingly. Moreover, this\ndeath was rapid, protracted sufferings were spared them. These were\nreserved for the captives who stood trembling not twenty paces distant.\nSix blows of the méré, given by six stalwart warriors, stretched the\nvictims on the ground in a pool of blood. It was the signal for a\nterrible scene of cannibalism, which followed in all its horrible\ndetails.\n\nGlenarvan and his companions, breathless with fright, strove to hide\nthis awful scene from the eyes of the two unhappy ladies. They now\nunderstood what awaited them at sunrise the next day, and what cruel\ntortures would doubtless precede such a death. They were dumb with\nhorror.\n\nThe funeral dance now began. Strong spirits, extracted from an\nindigenous plant, maddened the savages till they seemed no longer\nhuman. Would they not forget the taboo of the chief, and throw\nthemselves in their final outbreaks upon the prisoners who trembled at\ntheir frenzy?\n\n[Illustration: A terrible scene of cannibalism, which followed in all\nits horrible details.]\n\n[Illustration: The corpses, folded together, in a sitting posture,\nand tied in their clothes by a girdle of withes, were placed on this\nprimitive bier.]\n\nBut Kai-Koumou had preserved his reason in the midst of the general\nintoxication. He allowed this bloody orgy an hour to reach its utmost\nintensity. The last act of the funeral was played with the usual rites.\n\nThe bodies of Kara-Tété and his wife were taken up, and their limbs"}, {"chunk_id": 193, "text": "\"\ncried he.]\n\nAt last his voice rose above the tumult.\n\n\"Taboo! taboo!\" cried he.\n\nAt this word the crowd fell back before Glenarvan and his companions,\nthus temporarily preserved by a supernatural power. A few moments after\nthey were led back to the temple that served as their prison; but\nRobert Grant and Paganel were no longer with them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER L.\n\nTHE CHIEF'S FUNERAL.\n\n\nKai-Koumou, according to a custom quite ordinary in New Zealand, joined\nthe rank of priest to that of chief, and could, therefore, extend to\npersons or objects the superstitious protection of the taboo.\n\nThe taboo, which is common to the tribes of Polynesia, has the power\nto prohibit at once all connection with the object or person tabooed.\nAccording to the Maori religion, whoever should lay his sacrilegious\nhand on what is declared taboo would be punished with death by the\noffended god; and in case the divinity should delay to avenge his own\ninsult, the priests would not fail to excite his anger.\n\nAs for the prisoners confined in the temple, the taboo had rescued\nthem from the fury of the tribe. Some of the natives, the friends and\npartisans of Kai-Koumou, had stopped suddenly at the command of their\nchief, and had protected the captives.\n\n[Sidenote: THE TORTURES OF SUSPENSE.]\n\nGlenarvan, however, was not blind to the fate that was reserved for\nhim. Only his death could atone for the murder of a chief. Among savage\nraces death is always preceded by a protracted torture. He therefore\nexpected to cruelly expiate the righteous indignation that had nerved\nhis arm, but hoped that Kai-Koumou's rage would fall only on himself.\n\nWhat a night he and his companions passed! Who could depict their\nanguish, or measure their sufferings? Neither poor Robert nor brave\nPaganel had reappeared. But how could they doubt their fate? Were they\nnot the first victims of the natives' vengeance? All hope had vanished\neven from the heart of the major, who did not easily despair. John\nMangles felt himself growing mad at sight of the sad dejection of Mary\nGrant, thus separated from her brother. Glenarvan thought of that\nterrible request of Lady Helena, who, rather than yield to torture or\nslavery, preferred to die by his hand. Could he summon this fearful\ncourage? As for an escape, that was plainly impossible. Ten warriors,\narmed to the teeth, guarded the entrance of the temple.\n\nMorning came at last. There had been no communication between the\nnatives and the prisoners. The hut contained a considerable quantity\nof food, which the unfortunates scarcely touched. Hunger gave place to\ngrief. The day passed without bringing a change or a hope. Doubtless\nthe hour for the dead chief's funeral and their torture would be the\nsame.\n\nHowever, although Glenarvan concluded that Kai-Koumou must have\nabandoned all idea of exchange, the major on this point retained a\ngleam of hope.\n\n\"Who knows,\" said he, reminding Glenarvan of the effect produced upon\nthe chief by the death of Kara-Tété,--\"who knows but that Kai-Koumou in\nreality feels obliged to you?\"\n\nBut, in spite of these observations, Glenarvan would no longer hope.\nThe next day also passed away without the preparations for torture\nbeing made. The reason of the delay was this.\n\nThe Maoris believe that the soul, for three days after death, inhabits\nthe body of the deceased, and therefore during this time the corpse\nremains unburied. This custom was rigorously observed, and for two days\nthe pah was deserted. Captain Mangles frequently stood on Wilson's\nshoulders and surveyed the fortification. No native was seen; only the\nsentinels guarded in turn at the door of their prison.\n\nBut on the third day the huts were opened. The savages, men, women,\nand children, to the number of several hundreds, assembled in the pah,\nsilent and calm. Kai-Koumou came out of his house, and, surrounded by\nthe principal warriors of his tribe, took his place on a mound several\nfeet high in the centre of the fortification. The crowd of natives\nformed a semicircle aroun"}, {"chunk_id": 48, "text": "ors with which he painted\nhis face. His leggings were of ox-hide, and fastened to the ankle with\nstraps regularly crossed.\n\nThe figure of this Patagonian was fine, and his face denoted real\nintelligence in spite of the colors that adorned (!) it. He waited in\nan attitude full of dignity, and, seeing him so motionless and stern on\nhis pedestal of rocks, you would have taken him for a statue.\n\nThe major, as soon as he perceived him, pointed him out to Glenarvan,\nwho hastened towards him. The Patagonian took two steps forward;\nGlenarvan took his hand, and pressed it. There was in the latter's\nlook, in his physiognomy, such a feeling, such an expression of\ngratitude, that the native could not mistake it. He inclined his head\ngently, and uttered a few words that neither the major nor his friend\ncould understand.\n\nThe Patagonian, after regarding the strangers attentively, now changed\nthe language; but whatever it was, this new idiom was no better\nunderstood than the first. However, certain expressions which he used\nstruck Glenarvan. They seemed to belong to the Spanish language, of\nwhich he knew several common words.\n\n\"Spanish?\" said he.\n\nThe Patagonian nodded.\n\n\"Well,\" said the major, \"this is our friend Paganel's business. It is\nfortunate that he thought of learning Spanish.\"\n\nPaganel was called. He came at once and with all the grace of a\nFrenchman saluted the Patagonian, to which the latter paid no\nattention. The geographer was informed of the state of affairs, and was\nonly too glad to use his diligently-acquired knowledge.\n\n[Sidenote: SOMETHING WRONG.]\n\n\"Exactly,\" said he. And opening his mouth widely in order to articulate\nbetter, he said, in his best Spanish,--\n\n\"You--are--a--brave--man.\"\n\nThe native listened, but did not answer.\n\n\"He does not understand,\" said the geographer.\n\n\"Perhaps you do not pronounce well,\" replied the major.\n\n\"Very true! Curse the pronunciation!\"\n\nAnd again Paganel began, but with no better success.\n\n\"I will change the expression,\" said he. And pronouncing with\nmagisterial slowness, he uttered these words,--\n\n\"A--Patagonian,--doubtless?\"\n\nThe native remained mute as before.\n\n\"Answer!\" added Paganel.\n\nThe Patagonian did not reply.\n\n\"Do--you--understand?\" cried Paganel, violently enough to damage his\norgans of speech.\n\nIt was evident that the Indian did not understand, for he answered, but\nin Spanish,--\n\n\"I do not understand.\"\n\nIt was Paganel's turn now to be astonished, and he hastily put on his\nglasses, like one irritated.\n\n\"May I be hanged,\" said he, \"if I understand a word of this infernal\njargon! It is certainly Araucanian.\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Glenarvan; \"this man answered in Spanish.\"\n\nAnd, turning to the Patagonian, he repeated,--\n\n\"Spanish?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the native.\n\nPaganel's surprise became amazement. The major and Glenarvan looked at\nhim quizzingly.\n\n\"Ah, my learned friend!\" said the major, while a half smile played\nabout his lips, \"you have committed one of those blunders peculiar to\nyou.\"\n\n\"What!\" cried the geographer, starting.\n\n\"Yes, it is plain that this Patagonian speaks Spanish.\"\n\n\"He?\"\n\n[Illustration: A man of lofty stature was standing, motionless, on\none of the first ledges of the mountain.

These facts, proved already by the precise details given\nby Ayrton, are still further corroborated by the conversation of the\nconvicts that I have related. Let us not, therefore, be led astray\nby vain conjectures, but only be certain that Ayrton is Ben Joyce, a\nsailor of the Britannia, now chief of a band of convicts.\"\n\nThe major's explanation was accepted as conclusive.\n\n\"Now,\" replied Glenarvan, \"will you tell me how and why Harry Grant's\nquartermaster is in Australia?\"\n\n\"How, I do not know,\" said MacNabb; \"and the police declare they know\nno more than I on the subject.

At the Wimerra he communicated with one of his friends,\nthe farrier of Black Point, and thus left distinguishable traces of\nour course. His band followed us. A poisonous plant enabled him to\ngradually kill our oxen and horses. Then, at the proper moment, he\nentangled us in the marshes of the Snowy, and surrendered us to the\nconvicts he commanded.\"\n\nEverything possible had been said concerning Ben Joyce. His past had\njust been reviewed by the major, and the wretch appeared as he was,--a\nbold and formidable criminal. His intentions had been clearly proved,\nand required, on the part of Glenarvan, extreme vigilance. Fortunately,\nthere was less to fear from the detected bandit than the secret traitor.\n\nBut one serious fact appeared from this explanation. No one had yet\nthought of it; only Mary Grant, disregarding the past, looked forward\nto the future. Captain Mangles first saw her pale and disconsolate. He\nunderstood what was passing in her mind.\n\n\"Miss Mary!\" cried he, \"you are weeping!\"\n\n\"What is the matter, my child?\" asked Lady Helena.\n\n\"My father, madam, my father!\" replied the young girl.\n\nShe could not continue.

They are personal experiences, and will\nscarcely tend to put you on the track you have lost.\"\n\n[Sidenote: REVELATIONS AND DISCLOSURES.]\n\nA keen disappointment was manifest on the features of Glenarvan and\nthe major. They had believed the quartermaster to possess an important\nsecret, and yet he now confessed that his disclosures would be almost\nuseless.\n\nHowever that may be, this avowal of Ayrton, who surrendered himself\nwithout security, singularly affected his hearers, especially when he\nadded, in conclusion:\n\n\"Thus you are forewarned, my lord, that the business will be less\nadvantageous for you than for me.\"\n\n\"No matter,\" replied Glenarvan; \"I accept your proposal, Ayrton. You\nhave my word that you shall be landed at one of the islands of the\nPacific.\"\n\n\"Very well, my lord,\" said he.\n\nWas this strange man pleased with this decision? You might have doubted\nit, for his impassive countenance betrayed no emotion. He seemed as if\nacting for another more than for himself.\n\n\"I am ready to answer,\" continued he.\n\n\"We have no questions to ask you,\" rejoined Glenarvan. \"Tell us what\nyou know, Ayrton, and, in the first place, who you are.\"\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" replied he, \"I am really Tom Ayrton, quartermaster of the\nBritannia. I left Glasgow in Captain Grant's ship on the 12th of March,\n1861. For fourteen months we traversed together the Pacific, seeking\nsome favorable place to found a Scottish colony. Harry Grant was a man\ncapable of performing great deeds, but frequently serious disputes\narose between us. His character did not harmonize with mine. I could\nnot yield; but with Harry Grant, when his resolution is taken, all\nresistance is impossible. He is like iron towards himself and others.\nHowever, I dared to mutiny, and attempted to involve the crew and gain\npossession of the vessel. Whether I did right or wrong is of little\nimportance. However it may be, Captain Grant did not hesitate to land\nme, April 8, 1862, on the west coast of Australia.\"\n\n\"Australia!\" exclaimed the major, interrupting Ayrton's story. \"Then\nyou left the Britannia before her arrival at Callao, where the last\nnews of her was dated?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the quartermaster; \"for the Britannia never stopped at\nCallao while I was on board. If I spoke of Callao at O'Moore's farm, it\nwas your story that gave me this information.\"\n\n\"Go on, Ayrton,\" said Glenarvan.\n\n[Sidenote: MORE BLANKS THAN PRIZES.]\n\n\"I found myself, therefore, abandoned on an almost desert coast, but\nonly twenty miles from the penitentiary of Perth, the capital of\nWestern Australia. Wandering along the shore, I met a band of convicts\nwho had just escaped. I joined them. You will spare me, my lord, the\naccount of my life for two years and a half. It is enough to know that\nI became chief of the runaways, under the name of Ben Joyce. In the\nmonth of September, 1864, I made my appearance at the Irishman's farm,\nand was received as a servant under my true name of Ayrton. Here I\nwaited till an opportunity should be offered to gain possession of a\nvessel. This was my great object.

I then learned what I had not known, the Britannia's\nstoppage at Callao, the last news of her, dated June, 1862, two months\nafter my abandonment, the finding of the document, the shipwreck of the\nvessel, and finally the important reasons you had for seeking Captain\nGrant in Australia. I did not hesitate, but resolved to appropriate\nthe Duncan,--a marvelous ship, that would have distanced the best of\nthe British navy. However, there were serious injuries to be repaired.\nI therefore let her start for Melbourne, and offered myself to you in\nmy real character of quartermaster, volunteering to guide you to the\nscene o"}, {"chunk_id": 113, "text": "hed\nthe hospitable dwelling of Mr. O'Moore, where his labor insured him a\ncomfortable livelihood.\n\n\"And if Ayrton is pleased with me,\" said the Irish colonist, when the\nstory was finished, \"I cannot but be pleased with him.

He\nprobably thought, however, that the legitimate curiosity of his hearers\nought to be satisfied. What could he say that had not been repeated\na hundred times already? Glenarvan was, therefore, about to open the\nconversation on a new topic, to profit by the information received from\nAyrton, when the major, addressing him, said:\n\n\"You were quartermaster of the Britannia?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Ayrton.\n\nBut perceiving that a certain feeling of distrust, a doubt, however\nslight, had suggested this inquiry, he added,--\n\n\"I saved my contract from the wreck.\"\n\nHe immediately left the room in search of this authoritative document.\nDuring his absence, which lasted but a few moments, Mr. O'Moore said:\n\n\"My lord, I will answer for it that Ayrton is an honest man.

He is a true\nman, and worthy of your entire confidence.\"\n\nGlenarvan was about to answer that he had never doubted Ayrton's\nhonesty, when the latter returned and presented his contract. It was a\npaper signed by the owners of the Britannia and Captain Grant, whose\nwriting Mary recognized immediately. It stated that \"Tom Ayrton, able\nseaman, was engaged as quartermaster on board the brig Britannia of\nGlasgow.\" There was, therefore, no possible doubt of Ayrton's identity,\nfor it would have been difficult to suppose that this contract could be\nin his hands and not belong to him.\n\n[Sidenote: ENTANGLEMENTS.]\n\n\"Now,\" said Glenarvan, \"I appeal to you all for advice as to what is\nbest to be done. Your advice, Ayrton, would be particularly valuable,\nand I should be much obliged if you would give it to us.\"\n\nThe sailor reflected a few moments, and then replied:\n\n\"I thank you, my lord, for the confidence you place in me, and hope to\nshow myself worthy of it. I have some knowledge of the country, and of\nthe customs of the natives; and, if I can be of use to you----\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" replied Glenarvan.\n\n\"I think, like you,\" continued Ayrton, \"that Captain Grant and his two\nsailors were saved from the shipwreck; but, since they have not reached\nthe English possessions, since they have not reappeared, I doubt not\nthat their fate was the same as my own, and that they are prisoners of\nthe natives.\"\n\n\"You repeat, Mr. Ayrton, the arguments that I have already\nsubstantiated,\" said Paganel. \"The shipwrecked seamen are evidently\nprisoners of the natives, as they feared. But ought we to suppose that,\nlike you, they have been carried to the north?\"\n\n\"It is quite likely, sir,\" replied Ayrton. \"The hostile tribes would\nhardly remain in the neighborhood of the English provinces.\"\n\n\"This fact will complicate our search,\" said Glenarvan, quite\ndisconcerted. \"How shall we find the traces of the prisoners in the\ninterior of so vast a continent?\"\n\nA prolonged silence followed this remark. Lady Helena frequently\ncast a questioning glance at her companions, but without eliciting a\nresponsive sign. Paganel himself was silent, contrary to his custom.\nHis usual ingenuity now failed him. Captain Mangles paced the room with\nlong strides, as if he had been on the deck of his vessel, involved in\nsome difficulty.\n\n\"And you, Mr. Ayrton,\" said Lady Helena, at length, to the\nquartermaster, \"what would you do?\"\n\n\"Madam,\" replied he, promptly, \"I should re-embark on board the Duncan,\nand go straight to the place of the shipwreck. There I should act\naccording to circumstances, or indications that chance might furnish.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" said Glenarvan; \"but we must wait till the Duncan is\nrepaired.\"\n\n\"Ah! you"}, {"chunk_id": 150, "text": "on a good\nfooting with your mate, and in six days I engage to bring the Duncan to\nTwofold Bay.\"\n\n\"Well said!\" replied Glenarvan. \"You are a brave and intelligent man,\nAyrton, and will succeed.\"\n\nThe quartermaster was evidently more capable than any one else of\nfulfilling this difficult mission. Captain Mangles raised one final\nobjection, that Ayrton's presence was necessary to enable them to\nfind traces of the Brittania or Captain Grant; but the major observed\nthat they should remain encamped on the banks of the Snowy till the\nmessenger's return, that it was not proposed to resume the search\nwithout him, and that consequently his absence could be in no way\nprejudicial to their interests.\n\n\"Well then, Ayrton, start,\" said Glenarvan. \"Make haste, and return to\nthe encampment by way of Eden.\"\n\nA gleam of satisfaction seemed to light up the eyes of the\nquartermaster. He turned his head to one side, though not so quickly\nbut that Captain Mangles had intercepted his glance, and instinctively\nfelt his suspicions increased.\n\nThe quartermaster made his preparations for departure, aided by the\ntwo sailors, one of whom attended to his horse, and the other to his\nprovisions. Meantime Glenarvan wrote the letter designed for Tom Austin.\n\nHe ordered the mate of the Duncan to repair without delay to Twofold\nBay, and recommended the quartermaster to him as a man in whom he could\nplace entire confidence. As soon as he arrived at the bay, he was to\nsend a detachment of sailors under the command of Ayrton.\n\nHe had just reached this part of his letter, when the major, who had\nbeen looking over his shoulder, asked him, in a singular tone, how he\nwrote the word Ayrton.\n\n\"As it is pronounced,\" replied Glenarvan.\n\n\"That is a mistake,\" said the major coolly. \"It is pronounced Ayrton,\nbut it is written 'Ben Joyce'!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLI.\n\nTHE PLOT UNVEILED.\n\n\nThe sound of the name of Ben Joyce fell upon the party like a\nthunderbolt. Ayrton suddenly sprang to his feet. In his hand was a\nrevolver. A report was heard; and Glenarvan fell, struck by a bullet.\n\nBefore Captain Mangles and the sailors recovered from the surprise into\nwhich this unexpected turn of affairs had thrown them, the audacious\nconvict had escaped, and joined his band, scattered along the edge of\nthe wood of gum-trees.\n\n[Illustration: A report was heard; and Glenarvan fell, struck by a\nbullet.]\n\nThe tent did not offer a sufficient shelter against the bullets, and\nit was clearly necessary to beat a retreat. Glenarvan, who was but\nslightly injured, had risen.\n\n\"To the cart! to the cart!\" cried Captain Mangles, as he hurried on\nLady Helena and Mary Grant, who were soon in safety behind its stout\nsides.\n\nThe captain, the major, Paganel, and the sailors then seized their\nrifles, and stood ready to repel the convicts. Glenarvan and Robert had\njoined the ladies, while Olbinett hastened to the common defence.\n\nThese events had transpired with the rapidity of lightning. Captain\nMangles attentively watched the edge of the wood; but the reports\nsuddenly ceased on the arrival of Ben Joyce, and a profound silence\nsucceeded the noisy fusillade. A few wreaths of white smoke were still\ncurling up between the branches of the gum-trees, but the tall tufts of\ngastrolobium were motionless and all signs of attack had disappeared.\n\nThe major and Captain Mangles extended their examinations as far as the\ngreat trees. The place was abandoned. Numerous footprints were seen,\nand a few half-burnt cartridges smoked on the ground. The major, like\na prudent man, extinguished them, for a spark was enough to kindle a\nformidable conflagration in this forest of dry trees.\n\n\"The convicts have disappeared,\" said Captain Mangles.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the major; \"and this disappearance alarms me. I should\nprefer to meet them face to face. It is better to encounter a tiger in\nthe open plain than a serpent in the grass. Let us search these bushes\naround the cart.\"\n\n[Sidenote: UNRAVELINGS.]\n\nThe major and captain scoured the surrounding c"}, {"chunk_id": 16, "text": "lk straight.\"\n\n\"Be easy, my boy,\" replied Glenarvan, without adding that the use of\nthe \"cat-o'-nine-tails\" was prohibited, and moreover quite needless, on\nboard the Duncan.\n\n[Sidenote: GLASGOW GOSSIP.]\n\nTo complete the roll of the passengers, it will be sufficient to\ndescribe Major MacNabb. The major was a man of fifty, of calm,\nregular features, who did as he was bid; of an excellent and superior\ncharacter, modest, taciturn, peaceable, and mild; always agreeing\nwith anything or any one, disputing nothing, and neither contradicting\nhimself nor exaggerating. He would mount with measured step the\nstaircase to his bed-chamber, even were a cannon-ball behind him; and\nprobably to his dying day would never find an opportunity to fly into a\npassion.\n\nThis man possessed, in a high degree, not only the common courage of\nthe battle-field (that physical bravery due only to nervous strength),\nbut, better still, moral courage, that is to say, firmness of soul. If\nhe had a fault, it was that of being absolutely Scotch from head to\nfoot, a pure-blooded Caledonian, an infatuated observer of the ancient\ncustoms of his country. Through his relationship to the Glenarvans he\nlived at Malcolm Castle; and as major and military man it was very\nnatural that he should be found on board the Duncan.\n\nSuch, then, were the passengers of this yacht, summoned by unforeseen\ncircumstances to accomplish one of the most surprising voyages of\nmodern times. Since her arrival at the wharf at Glasgow, she had\nmonopolized the public attention. A considerable number came every day\nto visit her. They were interested in her alone, and spoke only of her,\nto the great umbrage of the other captains of the port, among others\nCaptain Burton, commanding the Scotia, a magnificent steamer, moored\nbeside the Duncan, and bound for Calcutta. The Scotia, from her size,\nhad a right to consider the Duncan as a mere fly-boat. Nevertheless,\nall the attraction centred in Lord Glenarvan's yacht, and increased\nfrom day to day.\n\nThe time of departure approached. Captain Mangles had shown himself\nskillful and expeditious. A month after her trial trip in the Frith of\nClyde, the Duncan, laden, provisioned, and equipped, was ready to put\nto sea. The 25th of August was appointed for the time of departure,\nwhich would enable the yacht to reach the southern latitudes by the\nbeginning of spring. Lord Glenarvan, when his plan was matured, did\nnot neglect to make investigations into the hardships and perils of the\nvoyage; yet he did not hesitate on this account, but prepared to leave\nMalcolm Castle.\n\nOn the 24th of August, Lord and Lady Glenarvan, Major MacNabb, Mary and\nRobert Grant, Mr. Olbinett, the steward of the yacht, and his wife, who\nwas in the service of Lady Glenarvan, left the castle, after taking an\naffectionate farewell of their family servants. Several hours afterward\nthey found themselves on board. Many of the population of Glasgow\nwelcomed with sympathetic admiration the young and courageous lady who\nrenounced the pleasures of a life of luxury, and sailed to the rescue\nof the shipwrecked sailors.\n\nThe apartments of Lord Glenarvan and his wife occupied the entire stern\nof the vessel. They consisted of two bed-chambers, a parlor, and two\ndressing-rooms, adjoining which was an open square inclosed by six\ncabins, five of which were occupied by Mary and Robert Grant, Mr. and\nMrs. Olbinett, and Major MacNabb. As for the cabins of the captain and\nthe mate, they were situated in the forecastle, and opened on the deck.\nThe crew were lodged between-decks very comfortably, for the yacht of\ncourse carried nothing but her coal, provisions, and armament.\n\nThe Duncan was to start on the night of the 24th, as the tide fell at\nthree o'clock in the morning. But first those who were present were\nwitness to a touching scene. At eight in the evening Lord Glenarvan and\nhis companions, the entire crew, from the firemen to the captain, all\nwho were to take part in this voyage of sacrifice, left the yacht,"}]}

Call him Ben Joyce, for he has well earned\nhis name.' These rascals then left the wood of gum-trees. I knew what\nI wished, and returned to the encampment with the certainty that all\nthe convicts in Australia are not reformed, in spite of Paganel's\narguments.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Glenarvan, whose face was pale with anger, \"Ayrton has\nbrought us here to rob and assassinate us?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the major.\n\n\"And, since leaving the Wimerra, his band has followed and watched us,\nwaiting for a favorable opportunity?\"\n\n[Sidenote: FROM DEPTH TO DEPTH.]\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"But this wretch is not, then, a sailor of the Britannia? He has stolen\nhis name and contract?\"\n\nAll eyes were turned towards MacNabb, who must have considered this\nmatter.\n\n\"These,\" replied he, in his calm voice, \"are the proofs that can be\nderived from this obscure state of affairs. In my opinion this man's\nreal name is Ayrton. Ben Joyce is his fighting title. It is certain\nthat he knows Harry Grant, and has been quartermaster on board the\nBritannia. These facts, proved already by the precise details given\nby Ayrton, are still further corroborated by the conversation of the\nconvicts that I have related. Let us not, therefore, be led astray\nby vain conjectures, but only be certain that Ayrton is Ben Joyce, a\nsailor of the Britannia, now chief of a band of convicts.\"\n\nThe major's explanation was accepted as conclusive.\n\n\"Now,\" replied Glenarvan, \"will you tell me how and why Harry Grant's\nquartermaster is in Australia?\"\n\n\"How, I do not know,\" said MacNabb; \"and the police declare they know\nno more than I on the subject. Why, it is also impossible for me to\nsay. Here is a mystery that the future will explain.\"\n\n\"The police do not even know the identity of Ayrton and Ben Joyce,\"\nsaid Captain Mangles.\n\n\"You are right, John,\" replied the major; \"and such information would\nbe likely to facilitate their search.\"\n\n\"This unfortunate, then,\" remarked Lady Helena, \"intruded into\nO'Moore's farm with a criminal intention?\"\n\n\"There is no doubt of it,\" continued MacNabb. \"He was meditating\nsome hostile attack upon the Irishman, when a better opportunity was\noffered. Chance threw us in his way. He heard Glenarvan's story of the\nshipwreck, and, like a bold man, he promptly decided to take part in\nthe expedition. At the Wimerra he communicated with one of his friends,\nthe farrier of Black Point, and thus left distinguishable traces of\nour course. His band followed us. A poisonous plant enabled him to\ngradually kill our oxen and horses. Then, at the proper moment, he\nentangled us in the marshes of the Snowy, and surrendered us to the\nconvicts he commanded.\"\n\nEverything possible had been said concerning Ben Joyce. His past had\njust been reviewed by the major, and the wretch appeared as he was,--a\nbold and formidable criminal. His intentions had been clearly proved,\nand required, on the part of Glenarvan, extreme vigilance. Fortunately,\nthere was less to fear from the detected bandit than the secret traitor.\n\nBut one serious fact appeared from this explanation. No one had yet\nthought of it; only Mary Grant, disregarding the past, looked forward\nto the future. Captain Mangles first saw her pale and disconsolate. He\nunderstood what was passing in her mind.\n\n\"Miss Mary!\" cried he, \"you are weeping!\"\n\n\"What is the matter, my child?\" asked Lady Helena.\n\n\"My father, madam, my father!\" replied the young girl.\n\nShe could not continue. But a sudden revelation dawned on the mind of\neach. They comprehended Mary's grief, why the tears flowed from her\neyes, why the "}, {"chunk_id": 227, "text": "t be sorry,\nMary?\"\n\n\"Why should I be sorry, my child?\"\n\n\"And you will let me do as I wish?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" asked she, anxiously.\n\n\"My sister, I shall be a sailor----!\"\n\n\"And leave me?\" cried the young girl, clasping her brother's hand.\n\n[Sidenote: EULOGY AND THRENODY.]\n\n\"Yes, sister, I shall be a sailor, like my father, and like Captain\nJohn. Mary, my dear Mary, he has not lost all hope! You will have, like\nme, confidence in his devotion. He has promised that he will make me a\nthorough and efficient sailor, and we shall seek our father together.\nSay that you are willing, sister. What our father would have done for\nus it is our duty, or mine at least, to do for him. My life has but one\nobject, to which it is wholly devoted,--to search always for him who\nwould never have abandoned either of us.

Mary!\" cried he, \"it is in vain for them to speak, or to keep\nsilent. I hope still, and shall always do so. A man like our father\ndoes not die till he has accomplished his purpose!\"\n\nMary Grant could not reply; sobs choked her utterance. A thousand\nemotions agitated her soul at the thought that new attempts would be\nmade to find her father, and that the young captain's devotion was\nboundless.\n\n\"Does Mr. John still hope?\" asked she.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Robert. \"He is a brother who will never forsake us. I\nshall be a sailor, shall I not, sister,--a sailor to seek my father\nwith him? Are you willing?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mary. \"But must we be separated?\"\n\n\"You will not be alone, Mary, I know. John has told me so. Lady Helena\nwill not permit you to leave her. You are a woman, and can and ought to\naccept her benefits. To refuse them would be ungrateful. But a man, as\nmy father has told me a hundred times, ought to make his own fortune.\"\n\n\"But what will become of our house at Dundee, so full of associations?\"\n\n\"We will keep it, my sister. All that has been well arranged by our\nfriend John and Lord Glenarvan, who will keep you at Malcolm Castle\nlike a daughter. He said so to John, who told me. You will be at home\nthere, and wait till John and I bring back our father. Ah, what a\njoyful day that will be!\" cried Robert, whose face was radiant with\nenthusiasm.\n\n\"My brother, my child!\" exclaimed Mary, \"how happy our father would be\nif he could hear you! How much you resemble him, dear Robert! When you\nare a man you will be quite like him!\"\n\n\"God grant it, Mary!\" said Robert, glowing with holy and filial pride.\n\n\"But how shall we pay our debt to Lord and Lady Glenarvan?\" continued\nMary.\n\n\"Oh, that will not be difficult,\" answered Robert, with his boyish\nimpulsiveness. \"We will tell them how much we love and respect them,\nand we will show it to them by our actions.\"\n\n\"That is all we can do!\" added the young girl, covering her brother's\nface with kisses; \"and all that they will like, too!\"\n\nThen, relapsing into reveries, the two children of the captain gazed\nsilently into the shadowy obscurity of the night. However, in fancy\nthey still conversed, questioned, and answered each other. The sea\nrocked the ship in silence, and the phosphorescent waters glistened in\nthe darkness.\n\nBut now a strange, a seemingly supernatural event took place. The\nbrother and sister, by one of those magnetic attractions that\nmysteriously draw the souls of friends together, experienced at the\nsame instant the same curious hallucination.\n\n[Sidenote: \"METHOUGHT, THE BILLOWS SPOKE!\"]\n\nFrom the midst of these alternately brightening and darkening waves,\nthey thought they heard a voice issue, whose depth of sadness stirred\nevery fibre of their hearts.\n\n\"Help! help!\" cried the voice.\n\n\"Mary,\" said Robert, \"did you hear?"}, {"chunk_id": 196, "text": "scene of cannibalism, which followed in all\nits horrible details.]\n\n[Illustration: The corpses, folded together, in a sitting posture,\nand tied in their clothes by a girdle of withes, were placed on this\nprimitive bier.]\n\nBut Kai-Koumou had preserved his reason in the midst of the general\nintoxication. He allowed this bloody orgy an hour to reach its utmost\nintensity. The last act of the funeral was played with the usual rites.\n\nThe bodies of Kara-Tété and his wife were taken up, and their limbs\nbent and gathered against the stomach, according to the New Zealand\ncustom. The place for the tomb had been chosen outside of the\nfortification, about two miles distant, on the summit of a small\nmountain, called Maunganamu, situated on the right shore of the lake.\n\nThither the bodies were to be carried. Two very rude palanquins, or\nrather litters, were brought to the foot of the mound. The corpses,\nfolded together, in a sitting posture, and tied in their clothes by a\ngirdle of withes, were placed on this primitive bier. Four warriors\nbore it between them, and the entire tribe, chanting the funeral hymn,\nfollowed them in procession to the place of burial.\n\nThe captives, who were always watched, saw them leave the inner\ninclosure of the pah, and then the songs and cries gradually died away.\nFor about half an hour this funeral escort continued in sight, in the\ndepths of the valley. Finally they perceived it again winding along\nthe mountain paths. The distance gave a fantastic appearance to the\nundulating movements of the long, sinuous column.\n\nThe tribe stopped at the summit of the mountain, which was eight\nhundred feet high, at the place prepared for Kara-Tété's interment.\nA common Maori would have had only a hole and a heap of stones for a\ngrave; but for a powerful and dreaded chief, destined doubtless for a\nspeedy deification, a tomb worthy of his exploits was reserved.\n\n[Sidenote: THE LAST NIGHT.]\n\nThe sepulchre had been surrounded by palisades, while stakes,\nornamented with faces reddened with ochre, stood beside the grave\nwhere the bodies were to lie. The relatives had not forgotten that the\n\"waidoua\" (the spirit of the dead) feeds on substantial nourishment\nlike the body during this perishable life. Food had therefore been\ndeposited in the inclosure, together with the weapons and clothes of\nthe deceased.\n\nNothing was wanting for the comfort of the tomb. Husband and wife were\nlaid side by side, and then covered with earth and grass after a series\nof renewed lamentations. Then the procession silently descended the\nmountain, and now no one could ascend it under penalty of death, for it\nwas tabooed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LI.\n\nSTRANGELY LIBERATED.\n\n\nJust as the sun was disappearing behind Lake Taupo, the captives were\nled back to their prison. They were not to leave it again until the\nsummit of the Wahiti mountains should kindle with the first beams of\nthe day. One night remained to prepare for death. In spite of the\nfaintness, in spite of the horror with which they were seized, they\nshared their repast in common.\n\n\"We shall need all the strength possible to face death,\" said\nGlenarvan. \"We must show these barbarians how Europeans and Christians\ncan die.\"\n\nThe meal being finished, Lady Helena repeated the evening prayer aloud,\nwhile all her companions, with uncovered heads, joined her.

Chance alone had led them back to\nthis vessel that they had ceased to regard as theirs, and in what a sad\nstate of exhaustion and feebleness!\n\nHowever, before thinking of fatigue, or the imperative calls of hunger\nand thirst, Glenarvan questioned Tom Austin concerning his presence in\nthese waters. Why was the Duncan on the eastern coast of New Zealand?\nWhy was she not in the hands of Ben Joyce? By what providential working\nhad God restored her to the fugitives? These were the questions that\nwere hurriedly addressed to Tom Austin. The old sailor did not know\nwhich to answer first. He therefore concluded to listen only to Lord\nGlenarvan, and reply to him.\n\n\"But the convicts?\" inquired Glenarvan. \"What have you done with the\nconvicts?\"\n\n\"The convicts!\" replied Tom Austin, like a man who is at a loss to\nunderstand a question.\n\n\"Yes; the wretches who attacked the yacht.\"\n\n\"What yacht, my lord? The Duncan?\"\n\n\"Of course. Did not Ben Joyce come on board?\"\n\n\"I do not know Ben Joyce; I have never seen him.\"\n\n\"Never?\" cried Glenarvan, amazed at the answers of the old sailor.\n\"Then will you tell me why the Duncan is now on the shores of New\nZealand?\"\n\n[Sidenote: MYSTERY MORE MYSTERIOUS!]\n\nAlthough Glenarvan and his friends did not at all understand Austin's\nastonishment, what was their surprise when he replied, in a calm voice:\n\n\"The Duncan is here by your lordship's orders.\"\n\n\"By my orders?\" cried Glenarvan.\n\n\"Yes, my lord. I only conformed to the instructions contained in your\nletter.\"\n\n\"My letter?\" exclaimed Glenarvan.\n\nThe ten travelers at once surrounded Tom Austin, and gazed at him in\neager curiosity. The letter written at the Snowy River had reached the\nDuncan.\n\n\"Well,\" continued Glenarvan, \"let us have an explanation; for I almost\nthink I am dreaming. You received a letter, Tom?\"\n\n\"Yes; a letter from your lordship.\"\n\n\"At Melbourne?\"\n\n\"At Melbourne; just as I had finished the repair of the ship.\"\n\n\"And this letter?\"\n\n\"It was not written by you; but it was signed by you, my lord.\"\n\n\"Exactly; it was sent by a convict, Ben Joyce.\"\n\n\"No; by the sailor called Ayrton, quartermaster of the Britannia.\"\n\n\"Yes, Ayrton or Ben Joyce; it is the same person. Well, what did the\nletter say?\"\n\n\"It ordered me to leave Melbourne without delay, and come to the\neastern shores of----\"\n\n\"Australia!\" cried Glenarvan, with an impetuosity that disconcerted the\nold sailor.\n\n\"Australia?\" repeated Tom, opening his eyes. \"No, indeed; New Zealand!\"\n\n\"Australia, Tom! Australia!\" replied Glenarvan's companions, with one\nvoice.\n\n[Illustration: As soon as they set foot on deck the bagpiper struck up\na well remembered air, while hearty hurrahs welcomed the owner's return\non board.]\n\nAustin was now bewildered. Glenarvan spoke with such assurance, that\nhe feared he had made a mistake in reading the letter. Could he,\nfaithful and accurate sailor that he was, have committed such a\nblunder? He began to feel troubled.\n\n[Illustration: This sally finished the poor geographer.]\n\n\n\"Be easy, Tom,\" said Lady Helena. \"Providence has decreed----\"\n\n\"No, madam, pardon me,\" returned the sailor; \"no, it is not possible! I\nam not mistaken. Ayrton also read the letter, and he, on the contrary,\nwished to go to Australia.\"\n\n\"Ayrton?\" cried Glenarvan.\n\n\"The very one. He maintained that it was a mistake, and that you had\nappointed Twofold Bay as the place of meeting.\"\n\n\"Have you the letter, Tom?\" asked the major, greatly puzzled.\n\n\"Yes, Mr. MacNabb,\" replied Austin. \"I will soon bring it.\"\n\nHe accordingly repaired to his own cabin. While he was gone, they gazed\nat each other in silence, except the major, who, with his eye fixed\nupon Paganel, said, as he folded his arms:\n\n\"Indeed, I must confess, Paganel, that this is a little too much.\"\n\nAt this moment Austin returned. He held in his hand the letter written\nby Paganel, and signed by Glenarvan.\n\n\"Read it, my lord,\" said the old sailor.\n\nGlenarvan to"}, {"chunk_id": 234, "text": "Thank you, my lord!\" replied Ayrton, simply.\n\nSuch were the last words exchanged between Glenarvan and the\nquartermaster. The boat was ready, and Ayrton embarked. Captain Mangles\nhad previously sent to the island several cases of preserved food, some\nclothes, tools, weapons, and a supply of powder and shot. The abandoned\nman could therefore employ his time to advantage. Nothing was wanting,\nnot even books, foremost among which was a Bible.\n\nThe hour for separation had come. The crew and passengers stood on\ndeck. More than one felt the heart strangely moved. Lady Helena and\nMary Grant could not repress their emotion.\n\n\"Must it then be so?\" inquired the young wife of her husband. \"Must\nthis unfortunate be abandoned?\"\n\n[Sidenote: \"FAREWELL! A LONG FAREWELL!\"]\n\n\"He must, Helena,\" answered Glenarvan. \"It is his punishment.\"\n\nAt this moment the boat, commanded by Captain Mangles, started. Ayrton\nraised his hat and gave a grave salute. Glenarvan and the crew returned\nthis last farewell, as if to a man about to die, as he departed, in a\nprofound silence.\n\nOn reaching the shore, Ayrton leaped upon the sand, and the boat\nreturned. It was then four o'clock in the afternoon, and from the upper\ndeck the passengers could see the quartermaster, with folded arms,\nstanding motionless as a statue, on a rock, and gazing at the vessel.\n\n\"Shall we start, my lord?\" asked Captain Mangles.\n\n\"Yes, John,\" replied Glenarvan, quickly, with more emotion than he\nwished to manifest.\n\n\"All right!\" cried the captain to the engineer.\n\nThe steam hissed, the screw beat the waves, and at eight o'clock the\nlast summits of Tabor Island disappeared in the shadows of the night.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LX.\n\nPAGANEL'S LAST ENTANGLEMENT.\n\n\nEleven days after leaving Tabor Island the Duncan came in sight of the\nAustralian coast, and anchored in Talcahuana Bay. Five months had elapsed\nsince her departure from this port, during which time the travelers\nhad made the circuit of the world on this thirty-seventh parallel.\nTheir efforts had not been in vain, for they had found the shipwrecked\nsurvivors of the Britannia.\n\nThe Duncan, having taken in her necessary stores, skirted the coasts\nof Patagonia, doubled Cape Horn, and steamed across the Atlantic. The\nvoyage was very uneventful. The yacht carried a full complement of\nhappy people; there seemed to be no secrets on board.\n\nA mystery, however, still perplexed MacNabb. Why did Paganel always\nkeep hermetically incased in his clothes, and wear a comforter over\nhis ears? The major longed to know the motive for this singular fancy.\nBut in spite of his questions, hints, and suspicions, Paganel did not\nunbutton his coat.\n\nAt last, fifty-three days after leaving Talcahuana, Captain Mangles\ndescried the lighthouse of Cape Clear. The vessel entered St. George's\nChannel, crossed the Irish Sea, and passed into the Frith of Clyde. At\neleven o'clock they anchored at Dumbarton, and early in the afternoon\nthe travelers reached Malcolm Castle, amidst the hurrahs of their\ntenantry and friends.\n\nThus it was that Harry Grant and his two companions were rescued, and\nthat John Mangles married Mary Grant in the old cathedral of St. Mungo,\nwhere the Rev. Mr. Morton, who nine months before had prayed for the\nrescue of the father, now blessed the union of the daughter with one\nof his deliverers. It was arranged that Robert should be a sailor,\nlike his father and brother-in-law, and that he should continue the\ncontemplated project of the former, under the munificent patronage of\nLord Glenarvan.\n\nBut was Jacques Paganel to die a bachelor? Certainly not; for, after\nhis heroic exploits, the worthy geographer could not escape celebrity.\nHis eccentricities (and his abilities) made him much talked of in\nScotland. People seemed as though they could not show him enough\nattention.\n\nJust at this time an amiable lady of thirty, none other than the\nmajor's cousin, a little eccentric herself, but still agreeable and\ncharming, fell in love with the geographer's peculiarities.

Let us not, therefore, be led astray\nby vain conjectures, but only be certain that Ayrton is Ben Joyce, a\nsailor of the Britannia, now chief of a band of convicts.\"\n\nThe major's explanation was accepted as conclusive.\n\n\"Now,\" replied Glenarvan, \"will you tell me how and why Harry Grant's\nquartermaster is in Australia?\"\n\n\"How, I do not know,\" said MacNabb; \"and the police declare they know\nno more than I on the subject.

Chance threw us in his way. He heard Glenarvan's story of the\nshipwreck, and, like a bold man, he promptly decided to take part in\nthe expedition. At the Wimerra he communicated with one of his friends,\nthe farrier of Black Point, and thus left distinguishable traces of\nour course. His band followed us. A poisonous plant enabled him to\ngradually kill our oxen and horses. Then, at the proper moment, he\nentangled us in the marshes of the Snowy, and surrendered us to the\nconvicts he commanded.\"\n\nEverything possible had been said concerning Ben Joyce. His past had\njust been reviewed by the major, and the wretch appeared as he was,--a\nbold and formidable criminal. His intentions had been clearly proved,\nand required, on the part of Glenarvan, extreme vigilance. Fortunately,\nthere was less to fear from the detected bandit than the secret traitor.\n\nBut one serious fact appeared from this explanation. No one had yet\nthought of it; only Mary Grant, disregarding the past, looked forward\nto the future. Captain Mangles first saw her pale and disconsolate. He\nunderstood what was passing in her mind.\n\n\"Miss Mary!\" cried he, \"you are weeping!\"\n\n\"What is the matter, my child?\" asked Lady Helena.\n\n\"My father, madam, my father!\" replied the young girl.\n\nShe could not continue. But a sudden revelation dawned on the mind of\neach.

Mary, my dear Mary, he has not lost all hope! You will have, like\nme, confidence in his devotion. He has promised that he will make me a\nthorough and efficient sailor, and we shall seek our father together.\nSay that you are willing, sister. What our father would have done for\nus it is our duty, or mine at least, to do for him. My life has but one\nobject, to which it is wholly devoted,--to search always for him who\nwould never have abandoned either of us. Dear Mary, how good our father\nwas!\"\n\n\"And so noble, so generous!\" added Mary. \"Do you know, Robert, that he\nwas already one of the glories of our country, and would have ranked\namong its great men if fate had not arrested his course?\"\n\n\"How well I know it!\" answered Robert.\n\nMary pressed her brother to her heart, and the child felt tears\ndropping upon his forehead.\n\n\"Mary! Mary!\" cried he, \"it is in vain for them to speak, or to keep\nsilent. I hope still, and shall always do so. A man like our father\ndoes not die till he has accomplished his purpose!\"\n\nMary Grant could not reply; sobs choked her utterance. A thousand\nemotions agitated her soul at the thought that new attempts would be\nmade to find her father, and that the young captain's devotion was\nboundless.\n\n\"Does Mr. John still hope?\" asked she.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Robert. \"He is a brother who will never forsake us. I\nshall be a sailor, shall I not, sister,--a sailor to seek my father\nwith him? Are you willing?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mary. \"But must we be separated?\"\n\n\"You will not be alone, Mary, I know. John has told me so. Lady Helena\nwill not permit you to leave her. You are a woman, and can and ought to\naccept her benefits. To refuse them would be ungrateful. But a man, as\nmy father has told me a hundred times, ought to make his own fortune.\"\n\n\"But what will become of our house at Dundee, so full of associations?\"\n\n\"We will keep it, my sister. All that has been well arranged by our\nfriend John and Lord Glenarvan, who will keep you at Malcolm Castle\nlike a daughter. He said so to John, who told me. You will be at home\nthere, and wait till John and I bring back our father. Ah, what a\njoyful day that will be!\" cried Robert, whose face was radiant with\nenthusiasm.\n\n\"My brother, my child!\" exclaimed Mary, \"how happy our father would be\nif he could hear you! How much you resemble him, dear Robert! When you\nare a man you will be quite like him!\"\n\n\"God grant it, Mary!\" said Robert, glowing with holy and filial pride.\n\n\"But how shall we pay our debt to Lord and Lady Glenarvan?\" continued\nMary.\n\n\"Oh, that will not be difficult,\" answered Robert, with his boyish\nimpulsiveness. \"We will tell them how much we love and respect them,\nand we will show it to them by our actions.\"\n\n\"That is all we can do!\" added the young girl, covering her brother's\nface with kisses; \"and all that they will like, too!\"\n\nThen, relapsing into reveries, the two children of the captain gazed\nsilently into the shadowy obscurity of the night. However, in fancy\nthey still conversed, questioned, and answered each other. The sea\nrocked the ship in silence, and the phosphorescent waters glistened in\nthe darkness.\n\nBut now a strange, a seemingly supernatural event took place. The\nbrother and sister, by one of those magnetic attractions that\nmysteriously draw the souls of friends together, experienced at the\nsame instant the same curious hallucination.\n\n[Sidenote: \"METHOUGHT, THE BILLOWS SPOKE!\"]\n\nFrom the midst of these alternately brightening and darkening waves,\nthey thought they heard a voice issue, whose depth of sadness stirred\nevery fibre of their hearts.\n\n\"Help! help!\" cried the voice.\n\n\"Mary,\" said Robert, \"did you hear?"}, {"chunk_id": 236, "text": "he plan of founding a Scottish\ncolony on the shores washed by the Pacific Ocean.\n\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK 46597 ***\n"}, {"chunk_id": 222, "text": "on, and\nstill I do not hesitate to tell you that I know little concerning Harry\nGrant.\"\n\n\"Little!\" cried Glenarvan.\n\n\"Yes, my lord; the circumstances that I am able to communicate to\nyou are relative to myself. They are personal experiences, and will\nscarcely tend to put you on the track you have lost.\"\n\n[Sidenote: REVELATIONS AND DISCLOSURES.]\n\nA keen disappointment was manifest on the features of Glenarvan and\nthe major. They had believed the quartermaster to possess an important\nsecret, and yet he now confessed that his disclosures would be almost\nuseless.\n\nHowever that may be, this avowal of Ayrton, who surrendered himself\nwithout security, singularly affected his hearers, especially when he\nadded, in conclusion:\n\n\"Thus you are forewarned, my lord, that the business will be less\nadvantageous for you than for me.\"\n\n\"No matter,\" replied Glenarvan; \"I accept your proposal, Ayrton. You\nhave my word that you shall be landed at one of the islands of the\nPacific.\"\n\n\"Very well, my lord,\" said he.\n\nWas this strange man pleased with this decision? You might have doubted\nit, for his impassive countenance betrayed no emotion. He seemed as if\nacting for another more than for himself.\n\n\"I am ready to answer,\" continued he.\n\n\"We have no questions to ask you,\" rejoined Glenarvan. \"Tell us what\nyou know, Ayrton, and, in the first place, who you are.\"\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" replied he, \"I am really Tom Ayrton, quartermaster of the\nBritannia. I left Glasgow in Captain Grant's ship on the 12th of March,\n1861. For fourteen months we traversed together the Pacific, seeking\nsome favorable place to found a Scottish colony. Harry Grant was a man\ncapable of performing great deeds, but frequently serious disputes\narose between us. His character did not harmonize with mine. I could\nnot yield; but with Harry Grant, when his resolution is taken, all\nresistance is impossible. He is like iron towards himself and others.\nHowever, I dared to mutiny, and attempted to involve the crew and gain\npossession of the vessel. Whether I did right or wrong is of little\nimportance. However it may be, Captain Grant did not hesitate to land\nme, April 8, 1862, on the west coast of Australia.\"\n\n\"Australia!\" exclaimed the major, interrupting Ayrton's story. \"Then\nyou left the Britannia before her arrival at Callao, where the last\nnews of her was dated?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the quartermaster; \"for the Britannia never stopped at\nCallao while I was on board. If I spoke of Callao at O'Moore's farm, it\nwas your story that gave me this information.\"\n\n\"Go on, Ayrton,\" said Glenarvan.\n\n[Sidenote: MORE BLANKS THAN PRIZES.]\n\n\"I found myself, therefore, abandoned on an almost desert coast, but\nonly twenty miles from the penitentiary of Perth, the capital of\nWestern Australia. Wandering along the shore, I met a band of convicts\nwho had just escaped. I joined them. You will spare me, my lord, the\naccount of my life for two years and a half. It is enough to know that\nI became chief of the runaways, under the name of Ben Joyce. In the\nmonth of September, 1864, I made my appearance at the Irishman's farm,\nand was received as a servant under my true name of Ayrton. Here I\nwaited till an opportunity should be offered to gain possession of a\nvessel. This was my great object. Two months later the Duncan arrived.\nDuring your visit at the farm you related, my lord, the whole story of\nCaptain Grant. I then learned what I had not known, the Britannia's\nstoppage at Callao, the last news of her, dated June, 1862, two months\nafter my abandonment, the finding of the document, the shipwreck of the\nvessel, and finally the important reasons you had for seeking Captain\nGrant in Australia. I did not hesitate, but resolved to appropriate\nthe Duncan,--a marvelous ship, that would have distanced the best of\nthe British navy. However, there were serious injuries to be repaired.\nI therefore let her start for Melbourne, and offered myself to you in\nmy real character of quartermaster, volunteering to guide you to the\nscene o"}, {"chunk_id": 162, "text": " me, my lord,\" continued Captain Mangles. \"I know Tom Austin.\nHe was to execute your orders, and start as soon as his departure was\npossible. Who knows whether the Duncan was ready, or her injuries\nrepaired, on the arrival of Ben Joyce at Melbourne? Supposing the\nyacht could not put to sea, and suffered one or two days of delay?\"\n\n\"You are right, John,\" replied Glenarvan. \"We must reach Twofold Bay.\nWe are only thirty-five miles from Delegete.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Paganel, \"and in that town we shall find rapid means of\nconveyance. Who knows whether we shall not arrive in time to prevent\nthis calamity?\"\n\n\"Let us start!\" cried Glenarvan.\n\nCaptain Mangles and Wilson at once occupied themselves in constructing\na raft of large dimensions. Experience had proved that pieces of bark\ncould not resist the violence of the torrent. The captain cut down\nseveral gum-trees, of which he made a rude but substantial raft. It was\na tedious task, and that day ended before the work was completed; but\nthe next day it was finished.\n\nThe waters had now considerably subsided. The torrent had become a\nriver again, with a rapid current.

Captain\nMangles had arranged on the starboard side, and confided to Wilson, a\nkind of oar to sustain the raft against the current, and prevent its\ndrifting. As for himself, he stood at the stern, and steered by means\nof a clumsy rudder. Lady Helena and Mary Grant occupied the centre\nof the raft near Mulready. Glenarvan, the major, Paganel, and Robert\nsurrounded them, ready to lend assistance.\n\n\"Are we ready, Wilson?\" asked Captain Mangles.\n\n\"Yes, captain,\" replied the sailor, seizing his oar with a firm hand.\n\n[Illustration: However, the raft was entangled in the midst of the\nriver, half a mile below where they started.]\n\n\"Attention, and bear up against the current.\"\n\nCaptain Mangles unmoored the raft, and with one push launched it into\nthe current of the river.

The rain had\nceased during the night, and the sky was covered with grayish clouds,\nwhich intercepted the rays of the sun, so that the temperature thus\nmoderated enabled them to endure the fatigues of the journey.\n\nBy consulting the map, Paganel had calculated that they would have to\ntravel eight days. But, instead of following the windings of the coast,\nhe considered it best to proceed to the village of Ngarnavahia, at the\njunction of the Waikato and Waipa rivers. Here the overland mail-road\npassed, and it would thence be easy to reach Drury, and rest, after\ntheir hardships, in a comfortable hotel.\n\nBut before they left the shore their attention was drawn to the large\nnumber of seals, of a peculiar appearance and genus, which lay on the\nbroad sands daily washed by the tidal water. These seals, with their\nrounded heads, their upturned look, their expressive eyes, presented an\nappearance, almost a physiognomy, that was mild and wellnigh tender,\nand served to recall to the traveler's memory the tales about the\nsirens of the olden and modern times, who served as the enchantresses\nto just such inhospitable shores as that seemed on which they had\nthemselves been cast. These animals, which are very numerous on the\ncoast of New Zealand, are hunted and killed for the sake of their\noil and their skins, and Paganel was of course able to tell how much\nwithin the last few years they had been searched for by the traders and\nnavigators on these seas.\n\n[Illustration: These seals, with rounded heads, upturned look,\nexpressive eyes, presented an appearance, almost a physiognomy, that\nwas mild and wellnigh tender.]\n\n[Illustration: The New Zealand \"kiwi,\" known to naturalists as the\napteryx.]\n\nWhilst speaking of these matters, Robert drew Paganel's attention to\nsome curious amphibious creatures, resembling the seals, but larger,\nwhich were devouring with rapidity the large stones lying on the shore.\n\n\"Look,\" said he, \"here are seals which feed on pebbles.\"\n\nPaganel assured them that these sea-elephants were only weighting\nthemselves preparatory to their descent into the water, and protested\nthat if they would but wait for a time they might see them descend and\nsubsequently return when they had unloaded themselves. The first part\nof this programme they saw accomplished; but, greatly to Paganel's\ngrief, Glenarvan would not longer delay the party, and they soon began\nto see inland beauties and curiosities of another sort.\n\nThe district through which they had to walk this day and the next was\none very thick with brush and under-wood, and there was no possibility\nof horse or vehicle passing or meeting them. They now regretted the\nabsence of their Australian cart, for the height and frequency of\nthe large ferns in the neighborhood prevented their making any rapid\nprogress on foot.\n\n[Sidenote: THE LAST STAGE OF PERIPATETICS.]\n\nHere and there, however, Robert and Paganel would rejoice together\nover some choice bush or bird that they had met with. Notable among\nthe latter was the New Zealand \"kiwi,\" known to naturalists as the\napteryx, and which is becoming very scarce, from the pursuit of its\nmany enemies. Robert discovered in a nest on the ground a couple of\nthese birds without tails or wings, but with four toes on the foot, and\na long beak or bill like that of a woodcock, and small white feathers\nall over its body. Of this bird there was then an entire absence in the\nzoological collections of Europe, and Paganel indulged the hope that he\nmight be able to be the proud contributor of such a valuable specimen\nto the \"Jardin\" of his own city.

Let us not, therefore, be led astray\nby vain conjectures, but only be certain that Ayrton is Ben Joyce, a\nsailor of the Britannia, now chief of a band of convicts.\"\n\nThe major's explanation was accepted as conclusive.\n\n\"Now,\" replied Glenarvan, \"will you tell me how and why Harry Grant's\nquartermaster is in Australia?\"\n\n\"How, I do not know,\" said MacNabb; \"and the police declare they know\nno more than I on the subject. Why, it is also impossible for me to\nsay. Here is a mystery that the future will explain.\"\n\n\"The police do not even know the identity of Ayrton and Ben Joyce,\"\nsaid Captain Mangles.\n\n\"You are right, John,\" replied the major; \"and such information would\nbe likely to facilitate their search.\"\n\n\"This unfortunate, then,\" remarked Lady Helena, \"intruded into\nO'Moore's farm with a criminal intention?\"\n\n\"There is no doubt of it,\" continued MacNabb. \"He was meditating\nsome hostile attack upon the Irishman, when a better opportunity was\noffered. Chance threw us in his way. He heard Glenarvan's story of the\nshipwreck, and, like a bold man, he promptly decided to take part in\nthe expedition. At the Wimerra he communicated with one of his friends,\nthe farrier of Black Point, and thus left distinguishable traces of\nour course. His band followed us. A poisonous plant enabled him to\ngradually kill our oxen and horses. Then, at the proper moment, he\nentangled us in the marshes of the Snowy, and surrendered us to the\nconvicts he commanded.\"\n\nEverything possible had been said concerning Ben Joyce. His past had\njust been reviewed by the major, and the wretch appeared as he was,--a\nbold and formidable criminal. His intentions had been clearly proved,\nand required, on the part of Glenarvan, extreme vigilance. Fortunately,\nthere was less to fear from the detected bandit than the secret traitor.\n\nBut one serious fact appeared from this explanation. No one had yet\nthought of it; only Mary Grant, disregarding the past, looked forward\nto the future. Captain Mangles first saw her pale and disconsolate. He\nunderstood what was passing in her mind.\n\n\"Miss Mary!\" cried he, \"you are weeping!\"\n\n\"What is the matter, my child?\" asked Lady Helena.\n\n\"My father, madam, my father!\" replied the young girl.\n\nShe could not continue. But a sudden revelation dawned on the mind of\neach.

There was\nan abundance of agreeable surroundings to talk about, and nature\nseemed dressed in one of her most attractive garbs. Birds, novel and\nvaried in their plumage, with flowers such as they had never before\ngazed on, were the constant theme of the travelers' remark; and when,\nin addition, they had in Mr. Olbinett one who knew how to spread\nbefore them and make the best of all the culinary novelties that were\nwithin reach, a very substantial foundation was possible for the\n\"feast of reason and the flow of soul\" which followed, and for which,\nas usual, they were to no small extent indebted to their learned\nhistorico-geographical professor, whose stock of information was as\nvaried as it was pleasant.\n\n[Illustration: A crack was heard; the cart inclined at an alarming\nangle; the water reached the feet of the ladies, and the whole vehicle\nthreatened to give way. It was an anxious moment.]\n\nAfter dinner the traveling party had, as if in anticipation, seated\nthemselves at the foot of a magnificent banksia; the young moon was\nrising high into the heavens, lengthening the twilight, and prolonging\nit into the evening hour; whilst the smoke of the major's cigar was\nseen curling upwards, losing itself in the foliage of the tree.\n\n\n[Illustration: After dinner the traveling party had, as if in\nanticipation, seated themselves at the foot of a magnificent banksia;\nthe young moon was rising high into the heavens, lengthening the\ntwilight, and prolonging it into the evening hour.]\n\n\"Monsieur Paganel,\" said Lady Helena, \"you have never given us the\nhistory that you promised when you supplied us with that long list of\nnames.\"\n\nThe gentleman addressed did not require any lengthened entreaties on\nthis subject, but, with an attentive auditory, and in the grandest\nof all lecture-rooms, he rehearsed to them the two great dramas of\nAustralian travel, which have made the names of Burke and Stuart\nimmortal in the history of that continent.\n\nHe told them that it was on the 20th of August, 1860, that Robert\nO'Hara Burke set out, under the auspices of the Royal Society of\nMelbourne, to cross the continent from south to north, and so to reach\nthe Indian Ocean. Eleven others--including a botanist, an astronomer,\nand an army officer--accompanied him, with horses and other beasts of\nburden. But the expedition did not long continue so numerous or so well\nprovided; in consequence of misunderstandings, several returned, and\nBurke pressed on with but few followers and fewer aids. Again, on the\n20th of November, he still further diminished his numbers by leaving\nbehind at an encampment several of his companions, that he and three\nothers might press on towards the north with as little incumbrance as\npossible. After a very painful journey across a stony desert, they\narrived at the extreme point reached by Stuart in 1845; and from this\npoint, after determining as accurately as possible their latitude and\nlongitude, they again started northward and seaward.\n\n[Sidenote: LYING DOWN TO DIE.]\n\nBy the 7th of January they had gone so far as to reach the southern\nlimit of the tropical heat; and now under a scorching sun, deceived by\nthe mirage, often without water, and then hailing a storm as a source\nof refreshment, now and then meeting with the aborigines, who could in\nno wise help them, they had indeed a hard road to travel, though having\nneither rivers, lakes, nor mountains to bar their path.\n\nAt length, however, there were various signs that they were approaching\nthe sea; by-and-by they reached the bank of a river which flows into\nthe Gulf of Carpentaria; and finally Burke and Wills, after terrible\nhardships, arrived at the point where the sea-water flowe"}, {"chunk_id": 150, "text": "on a good\nfooting with your mate, and in six days I engage to bring the Duncan to\nTwofold Bay.\"\n\n\"Well said!\" replied Glenarvan. \"You are a brave and intelligent man,\nAyrton, and will succeed.\"\n\nThe quartermaster was evidently more capable than any one else of\nfulfilling this difficult mission. Captain Mangles raised one final\nobjection, that Ayrton's presence was necessary to enable them to\nfind traces of the Brittania or Captain Grant; but the major observed\nthat they should remain encamped on the banks of the Snowy till the\nmessenger's return, that it was not proposed to resume the search\nwithout him, and that consequently his absence could be in no way\nprejudicial to their interests.\n\n\"Well then, Ayrton, start,\" said Glenarvan. \"Make haste, and return to\nthe encampment by way of Eden.\"\n\nA gleam of satisfaction seemed to light up the eyes of the\nquartermaster. He turned his head to one side, though not so quickly\nbut that Captain Mangles had intercepted his glance, and instinctively\nfelt his suspicions increased.\n\nThe quartermaster made his preparations for departure, aided by the\ntwo sailors, one of whom attended to his horse, and the other to his\nprovisions. Meantime Glenarvan wrote the letter designed for Tom Austin.\n\nHe ordered the mate of the Duncan to repair without delay to Twofold\nBay, and recommended the quartermaster to him as a man in whom he could\nplace entire confidence. As soon as he arrived at the bay, he was to\nsend a detachment of sailors under the command of Ayrton.\n\nHe had just reached this part of his letter, when the major, who had\nbeen looking over his shoulder, asked him, in a singular tone, how he\nwrote the word Ayrton.\n\n\"As it is pronounced,\" replied Glenarvan.\n\n\"That is a mistake,\" said the major coolly. \"It is pronounced Ayrton,\nbut it is written 'Ben Joyce'!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLI.\n\nTHE PLOT UNVEILED.\n\n\nThe sound of the name of Ben Joyce fell upon the party like a\nthunderbolt. Ayrton suddenly sprang to his feet. In his hand was a\nrevolver. A report was heard; and Glenarvan fell, struck by a bullet.\n\nBefore Captain Mangles and the sailors recovered from the surprise into\nwhich this unexpected turn of affairs had thrown them, the audacious\nconvict had escaped, and joined his band, scattered along the edge of\nthe wood of gum-trees.\n\n[Illustration: A report was heard; and Glenarvan fell, struck by a\nbullet.]\n\nThe tent did not offer a sufficient shelter against the bullets, and\nit was clearly necessary to beat a retreat. Glenarvan, who was but\nslightly injured, had risen.\n\n\"To the cart! to the cart!\" cried Captain Mangles, as he hurried on\nLady Helena and Mary Grant, who were soon in safety behind its stout\nsides.\n\nThe captain, the major, Paganel, and the sailors then seized their\nrifles, and stood ready to repel the convicts. Glenarvan and Robert had\njoined the ladies, while Olbinett hastened to the common defence.\n\nThese events had transpired with the rapidity of lightning. Captain\nMangles attentively watched the edge of the wood; but the reports\nsuddenly ceased on the arrival of Ben Joyce, and a profound silence\nsucceeded the noisy fusillade. A few wreaths of white smoke were still\ncurling up between the branches of the gum-trees, but the tall tufts of\ngastrolobium were motionless and all signs of attack had disappeared.\n\nThe major and Captain Mangles extended their examinations as far as the\ngreat trees. The place was abandoned. Numerous footprints were seen,\nand a few half-burnt cartridges smoked on the ground. The major, like\na prudent man, extinguished them, for a spark was enough to kindle a\nformidable conflagration in this forest of dry trees.\n\n\"The convicts have disappeared,\" said Captain Mangles.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the major; \"and this disappearance alarms me. I should\nprefer to meet them face to face. It is better to encounter a tiger in\nthe open plain than a serpent in the grass. Let us search these bushes\naround the cart.\"\n\n[Sidenote: UNRAVELINGS.]\n\nThe major and captain scoured the surrounding c"}]}

He wore a traveling\ncap, stout yellow buskins and leather gaiters, pantaloons of maroon\nvelvet, and a jacket of the same material, whose innumerable pockets\nseemed stuffed with note-books, memoranda, scraps, portfolios, and a\nthousand articles as inconvenient as they were useless, not to speak\nof a telescope which he carried in a sling.\n\nThe curiosity of this unknown being was a singular contrast to the\ncalmness of the major. He walked around MacNabb, and gazed at him\nquestioningly, whilst the latter did not trouble himself whence the\nstranger came, whither he was going, or why he was on board the Duncan.\n\nWhen this enigmatical character saw his approaches mocked by the\nindifference of the major, he seized his telescope, which at its full\nlength measured four feet; and motionless, with legs straddled, like a\nsign-post on a highway, he pointed his instrument to the line where sky\nand water met. After a few moments of examination, he lowered it, and\nresting it on the deck, leaned upon it as upon a cane. But immediately\nthe joints of the instrument closed, and the newly discovered\npassenger, whose point of support suddenly failed, was stretched at the\nfoot of the mainmast.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nAny one else in the major's place would at least have smiled, but he\ndid not even wink. The unknown then assumed his rôle.\n\n\"Steward!\" he cried, with an accent that betokened a foreigner.\n\nHe waited. No one appeared.\n\n\"Steward!\" he repeated, in a louder tone.\n\nMr. Olbinett was passing just then on his way to the kitchen under the\nforecastle. What was his astonishment to hear himself thus addressed by\nthis tall individual, who was utterly unknown to him!\n\n\"Where did this person come from?\" said he to himself. \"A friend of\nLord Glenarvan? It is impossible.\"\n\nHowever, he came on deck, and approached the stranger.\n\n\"Are you the steward of the vessel?\" the latter asked him.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Olbinett; \"but I have not the honor----\"\n\n\"I am the passenger of cabin number six.\"\n\n\"Number six?\" repeated the steward.\n\n\"Certainly; and your name is----?\"\n\n\"Olbinett.\"\n\n\"Well, Olbinett, my friend,\" answered the stranger of cabin number six,\n\"I must think of dinner, and acutely, too. For thirty-six hours I have\neaten nothing, or, rather, have slept, which is pardonable in a man\ncome all the way from Paris to Glasgow. What hour do you dine, if you\nplease?\"\n\n\"At nine o'clock,\" answered Olbinett, mechanically.\n\nThe stranger attempted to consult his watch; but this took some time,\nfor he did not find it till he came to his ninth pocket.\n\n[Sidenote: CONFUSION WORSE CONFOUNDED.]\n\n\"Well,\" said he, \"it is not yet eight o'clock; therefore, Olbinett, a\nbiscuit and a glass of sherry for the present; for I am fainting with\nhunger.\"\n\nOlbinett listened without understanding. Moreover, the unknown kept\ntalking, and passed from one subject to another with extreme volubility.\n\n\"Well,\" said he, \"has not the captain risen yet? And the mate? What is\nhe doing? Is he asleep, too? Fortunately, the weather is beautiful, the\nwind favorable, and the ship goes on quite by herself----\"\n\nJust as he said this, Captain Mangles appeared at the companion-way.\n\n\"Here is the captain,\" said Olbinett.\n\n\"Ah, I am delighted,\" cried the stranger, \"delighted to make your\nacquaintance, Captain Burton!\"\n\nIf any one was ever astounded, John Mangles certainly was, not less at\nhearing himself called \"Captain Burton,\" than at seeing this stranger\non board his vessel.\n\nThe latter continued, with more animation:\n\n\"Permit me to shake hands with you, and if I did not do so day before\nyesterday, it was that no one might be embarrassed at the moment of\ndeparture. But to-day, captain, I am truly happy to meet you.\"\n\nCaptain Mangles opened his eyes in measureless astonishment, looking\nfirst at Olbinett, and then at the new comer.\n\n\"Now,\" continued the latter, \"the introduction is"}, {"chunk_id": 113, "text": "hed\nthe hospitable dwelling of Mr. O'Moore, where his labor insured him a\ncomfortable livelihood.\n\n\"And if Ayrton is pleased with me,\" said the Irish colonist, when the\nstory was finished, \"I cannot but be pleased with him. He is an honest\nand intelligent man, a good worker, and, if he chooses, this house\nshall long be at his service.\"\n\nAyrton thanked Mr. O'Moore, and waited for further questions. He\nprobably thought, however, that the legitimate curiosity of his hearers\nought to be satisfied. What could he say that had not been repeated\na hundred times already? Glenarvan was, therefore, about to open the\nconversation on a new topic, to profit by the information received from\nAyrton, when the major, addressing him, said:\n\n\"You were quartermaster of the Britannia?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Ayrton.\n\nBut perceiving that a certain feeling of distrust, a doubt, however\nslight, had suggested this inquiry, he added,--\n\n\"I saved my contract from the wreck.\"\n\nHe immediately left the room in search of this authoritative document.\nDuring his absence, which lasted but a few moments, Mr. O'Moore said:\n\n\"My lord, I will answer for it that Ayrton is an honest man. During the\ntwo months that he has been in my employ, I have had no fault to find\nwith him. I knew the story of his shipwreck and captivity. He is a true\nman, and worthy of your entire confidence.\"\n\nGlenarvan was about to answer that he had never doubted Ayrton's\nhonesty, when the latter returned and presented his contract. It was a\npaper signed by the owners of the Britannia and Captain Grant, whose\nwriting Mary recognized immediately. It stated that \"Tom Ayrton, able\nseaman, was engaged as quartermaster on board the brig Britannia of\nGlasgow.\" There was, therefore, no possible doubt of Ayrton's identity,\nfor it would have been difficult to suppose that this contract could be\nin his hands and not belong to him.\n\n[Sidenote: ENTANGLEMENTS.]\n\n\"Now,\" said Glenarvan, \"I appeal to you all for advice as to what is\nbest to be done. Your advice, Ayrton, would be particularly valuable,\nand I should be much obliged if you would give it to us.\"\n\nThe sailor reflected a few moments, and then replied:\n\n\"I thank you, my lord, for the confidence you place in me, and hope to\nshow myself worthy of it. I have some knowledge of the country, and of\nthe customs of the natives; and, if I can be of use to you----\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" replied Glenarvan.\n\n\"I think, like you,\" continued Ayrton, \"that Captain Grant and his two\nsailors were saved from the shipwreck; but, since they have not reached\nthe English possessions, since they have not reappeared, I doubt not\nthat their fate was the same as my own, and that they are prisoners of\nthe natives.\"\n\n\"You repeat, Mr. Ayrton, the arguments that I have already\nsubstantiated,\" said Paganel. \"The shipwrecked seamen are evidently\nprisoners of the natives, as they feared. But ought we to suppose that,\nlike you, they have been carried to the north?\"\n\n\"It is quite likely, sir,\" replied Ayrton. \"The hostile tribes would\nhardly remain in the neighborhood of the English provinces.\"\n\n\"This fact will complicate our search,\" said Glenarvan, quite\ndisconcerted. \"How shall we find the traces of the prisoners in the\ninterior of so vast a continent?\"\n\nA prolonged silence followed this remark. Lady Helena frequently\ncast a questioning glance at her companions, but without eliciting a\nresponsive sign. Paganel himself was silent, contrary to his custom.\nHis usual ingenuity now failed him. Captain Mangles paced the room with\nlong strides, as if he had been on the deck of his vessel, involved in\nsome difficulty.\n\n\"And you, Mr. Ayrton,\" said Lady Helena, at length, to the\nquartermaster, \"what would you do?\"\n\n\"Madam,\" replied he, promptly, \"I should re-embark on board the Duncan,\nand go straight to the place of the shipwreck. There I should act\naccording to circumstances, or indications that chance might furnish.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" said Glenarvan; \"but we must wait till the Duncan is\nrepaired.\"\n\n\"Ah! you"}, {"chunk_id": 117, "text": "n now had to\ndeal with a man who was a critical judge, as he could see by Ayrton's\nkeen inquiries. At last the quartermaster finished his exploration by\ninspecting the masts and rigging; and, after a few moments of general\nreview, said:\n\n\"You have a fine vessel, my lord.\"\n\n\"A good one, too,\" replied Glenarvan.\n\n\"How many tons' burden is she?\"\n\n\"Two hundred and ten.\"\n\n\"Shall I be greatly mistaken,\" added Ayrton, \"if I say that the Duncan\ncan easily make fifteen knots an hour at full speed?\"\n\n\"Say seventeen,\" interposed the captain, \"and you will be nearer\nright.\"\n\n\"Seventeen!\" cried the quartermaster: \"why, then, no man-of-war, not\neven the best, could overtake her.\"\n\n\"Not one,\" said the captain. \"The Duncan is a real racing yacht, and is\nnot to be beaten in any way.\"\n\n\"Not even in sailing?\" asked Ayrton.\n\n\"Not even in sailing.\"\n\n\"Well, my lord, and you, captain, accept the compliments of a sailor\nwho knows what a vessel is worth.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Ayrton,\" replied Glenarvan; \"and now remain on board, and it\nwill be your own fault if the ship is not all you can desire.\"\n\n\"I will think of it, my lord,\" said the quartermaster, modestly.\n\nMr. Olbinett now approached, and informed Lord Glenarvan that dinner\nwas ready; and they all adjourned to the saloon.\n\n\"That Ayrton is an intelligent man,\" said Paganel to the major.\n\n\"Too intelligent!\" growled MacNabb, who, without any apparent reason,\ndisliked the looks and manners of the quartermaster.\n\nDuring dinner, Ayrton gave some interesting information concerning\nAustralia, with which he was perfectly familiar. He inquired the number\nof sailors that Glenarvan intended to take with him in his expedition.\nWhen he learned that only two, Wilson and Mulready, were to accompany\nthem, he seemed astonished. He advised Glenarvan to form his party of\nthe best seamen of the Duncan. He even insisted upon this point, which\nmust have removed all suspicion from the mind of the major.\n\n\"But,\" said Glenarvan, \"is there any danger in our journey across\nAustralia?\"\n\n\"None,\" replied Ayrton.\n\n[Sidenote: A CHANGE OF RESIDENCE.]\n\n\"Well, then, let us leave on board as many as possible. There must be\nmen to navigate the Duncan and take charge of her. It is especially\nimportant that she should arrive promptly at the place of meeting,\nwhich we will appoint hereafter. Let us not, therefore, lessen the\ncrew.\"\n\nAyrton seemed to appreciate this reason, and no longer insisted.\n\nAt evening the party separated. Ayrton and O'Moore's family returned to\ntheir home. The horses and cart were to be ready the next day, and the\ntravelers were to start at eight o'clock in the morning.\n\nLady Helena and Mary Grant now made their last preparations, which were\nshort and less minute than those of Jacques Paganel. The geographer\npassed half the night in unscrewing, cleaning, and screwing on again\nthe lenses of his telescope. He was still asleep the next morning, when\nthe major awoke him early with a loud summons.\n\nThe baggage had already been conveyed to the farm through the care of\nCaptain Mangles. A boat was waiting for the travelers, and they were\nnot long in embarking. The young captain gave his last orders to Tom\nAustin, and instructed him above all to await the commands of Lord\nGlenarvan at Melbourne, and execute them scrupulously whatever they\nmight be. The trusty sailor replied that they might rely on him. In the\nname of the crew he offered to his lordship their best wishes for the\nsuccess of the expedition. The boat put off, and a thunder of applause\nrent the air. In a few moments the party reached the shore, and in no\ngreat length of time arrived at O'Moore's farm.\n\nEverything was ready. Lady Helena was delighted with her quarters. The\nimmense cart, with its rude wheels and massive timbers, especially\npleased her. The six oxen yoked in pairs seemed to indicate primeval\nsimplicity, and were a novel sight. Ayrton, whip in hand, awaited the\norders of his new chief.\n\n[Illustration: Ayrton and Olbinett took their places respectively in\nf"}, {"chunk_id": 216, "text": "ajor, greatly puzzled.\n\n\"Yes, Mr. MacNabb,\" replied Austin. \"I will soon bring it.\"\n\nHe accordingly repaired to his own cabin. While he was gone, they gazed\nat each other in silence, except the major, who, with his eye fixed\nupon Paganel, said, as he folded his arms:\n\n\"Indeed, I must confess, Paganel, that this is a little too much.\"\n\nAt this moment Austin returned. He held in his hand the letter written\nby Paganel, and signed by Glenarvan.\n\n\"Read it, my lord,\" said the old sailor.\n\nGlenarvan took the letter, and read:\n\n\"Order for Tom Austin to put to sea, and bring the Duncan to the\neastern coast of New Zealand.\"\n\n\"New Zealand?\" cried Paganel, starting.\n\nHe snatched the letter from Glenarvan's hands, rubbed his eyes,\nadjusted his spectacles to his nose, and read in his turn.\n\n\"New Zealand!\" repeated he, in an indescribable tone, while the letter\nslipped from his fingers.\n\nJust then he felt a hand fall upon his shoulder. He turned, and found\nhimself face to face with the major.\n\n[Sidenote: PAGANEL IN THE WITNESS-BOX.]\n\n\"Well, my good Paganel,\" said MacNabb, in a grave tone, \"it is\nfortunate that you did not send the Duncan to Cochin-China.\"\n\nThis sally finished the poor geographer. A fit of laughter seized the\nwhole crew. Paganel, as if mad, ran to and fro, holding his head in his\nhands, and tearing his hair. However, when he had recovered from his\nfrenzy, there was still another unavoidable question to answer.\n\n\"Now, Paganel,\" said Glenarvan, \"be candid. I acknowledge that your\nabsent-mindedness has been providential. To be sure, without you the\nDuncan would have fallen into the hands of the convicts; without you we\nshould have been recaptured by the Maoris. But do tell me, what strange\nassociation of ideas, what unnatural aberration, induced you to write\nNew Zealand instead of Australia?\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Paganel. \"It was----\"\n\nBut at that moment his eyes fell upon Robert and Mary Grant, and he\nstopped short, finally replying:\n\n\"Never mind, my dear Glenarvan.

The mystery of the Duncan's\npresence there was solved; and the travelers, so miraculously saved,\nthought only of revisiting their comfortable cabins and partaking of a\ngood breakfast.\n\nHowever, leaving Lady Helena, Mary Grant, the major, Paganel, and\nRobert to enter the saloon, Glenarvan and Captain Mangles retained Tom\nAustin with them. They wished to question him further.\n\n\"Now, Tom,\" said Glenarvan, \"let me know: did not this order to sail\nfor the coast of New Zealand seem strange to you?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord,\" replied Austin. \"I was very much surprised; but, as I\nam not in the habit of discussing the orders I receive, I obeyed. Could\nI act otherwise? If any accident had happened from not following your\ninstructions, should I not have been to blame? Would you have done\ndifferently, captain?\"\n\n\"No, Tom,\" answered Captain Mangles.\n\n\"But what did you think?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"I thought, my lord, that, in the cause of Captain Grant, it was\nnecessary to go wherever you directed me; that by some combination of\ncircumstances another vessel would take you to New Zealand, and that\nI was to wait for you on the eastern coast of the island. Moreover,\non leaving Melbourne, I kept my destination secret, and the crew did\nnot know it till we were out at sea and the shores of Australia had\ndisappeared from sight. But then an incident occurred that perplexed me\nvery much.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, Tom?\" inquired Glenarvan.\n\n\"I mean,\" he replied, \"that when the quartermaster, Ayrton, learned,\nthe day after our departure, the Duncan's destination----\"\n\n\"Ayrton!\" cried Glenarvan. \"Is he on board?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord.\"\n\n\"Ayrton here!\" repeated Glenarvan, glancing at Captain Mangles.\n\n\"Wonderful indeed!\" said the young captain.\n\nIn an instant, with the swiftness of lightning, Ayrton's conduct, his\nlong-contrived treachery, Glenarvan's wound, the attack upon Mulready,\ntheir suffer"}]}

In my opinion this man's\nreal name is Ayrton. Ben Joyce is his fighting title. It is certain\nthat he knows Harry Grant, and has been quartermaster on board the\nBritannia.

Let us not, therefore, be led astray\nby vain conjectures, but only be certain that Ayrton is Ben Joyce, a\nsailor of the Britannia, now chief of a band of convicts.\"\n\nThe major's explanation was accepted as conclusive.\n\n\"Now,\" replied Glenarvan, \"will you tell me how and why Harry Grant's\nquartermaster is in Australia?\"\n\n\"How, I do not know,\" said MacNabb; \"and the police declare they know\nno more than I on the subject.

Chance threw us in his way. He heard Glenarvan's story of the\nshipwreck, and, like a bold man, he promptly decided to take part in\nthe expedition. At the Wimerra he communicated with one of his friends,\nthe farrier of Black Point, and thus left distinguishable traces of\nour course. His band followed us. A poisonous plant enabled him to\ngradually kill our oxen and horses. Then, at the proper moment, he\nentangled us in the marshes of the Snowy, and surrendered us to the\nconvicts he commanded.\"\n\nEverything possible had been said concerning Ben Joyce. His past had\njust been reviewed by the major, and the wretch appeared as he was,--a\nbold and formidable criminal. His intentions had been clearly proved,\nand required, on the part of Glenarvan, extreme vigilance. Fortunately,\nthere was less to fear from the detected bandit than the secret traitor.\n\nBut one serious fact appeared from this explanation. No one had yet\nthought of it; only Mary Grant, disregarding the past, looked forward\nto the future. Captain Mangles first saw her pale and disconsolate. He\nunderstood what was passing in her mind.\n\n\"Miss Mary!\" cried he, \"you are weeping!\"\n\n\"What is the matter, my child?\" asked Lady Helena.\n\n\"My father, madam, my father!\" replied the young girl.\n\nShe could not continue.

The two ladies exerted themselves\nheroically, but their strength was failing every hour. They dragged\nthemselves along, they no longer walked.\n\nThe next day they started at daybreak, and at eleven o'clock Delegete\ncame in sight, fifty miles from Twofold Bay. Here means of conveyance\nwere quickly obtained. Feeling himself so near the coast, hope returned\nto Glenarvan's heart; perhaps there had been some slight delay, and he\nwould arrive before the Duncan! In twenty-four hours he would reach the\nbay!\n\nAt noon, after a comforting repast, all the travelers took their seats\nin a mail-coach, and left Delegete at the full speed of five strong\nhorses. The postilions, stimulated by the promise of a large reward,\ndrove them along at a rapid rate, over a well-kept road. No time was\nlost in changing horses, and it seemed as if Glenarvan had inspired\nall with his own intense eagerness.\n\n[Illustration: The two ladies exerted themselves heroically, but their\nstrength was failing every hour. They dragged themselves along, they no\nlonger walked.]\n\nAll day and all night they traveled with the same swiftness, and at\nsunrise the next morning a low murmur announced the proximity of the\nIndian Ocean. It was necessary, however, to pass around the bay to gain\nthat part of the coast where Tom Austin was to meet the travelers.\n\nWhen the sea appeared, all eyes quickly surveyed the wide expanse. Was\nthe Duncan there, by a miracle of Providence, as she had been discerned\nbefore by some of them on the Argentine coast? Nothing was seen; sky\nand water mingled in an unbroken horizon; not a sail brightened the\nvast extent of ocean.\n\nOne hope still remained. Perhaps Tom Austin had thought it best to cast\nanchor in Twofold Bay, as the sea was rough and a vessel could not be\nmoored in safety near such shores.\n\n\"To Eden!\" said Glenarvan.\n\nThe mail-coach at once took the road to the right, which ran along the\nedge of the bay, and proceeded towards the little town of Eden, only\nfive miles distant. The postilions stopped not far from the light that\nguarded the entrance to the harbor. Several ships were anchored in the\nroadstead, but none displayed the flag of Malcolm Castle.\n\nGlenarvan, Captain Mangles, and Paganel alighted immediately, and\nhastened to the custom-house. Here they questioned the employees, and\nconsulted the latest arrivals. No vessel had entered the bay for a week.\n\n\"She may not have started!\" cried Glenarvan, who would not despair.\n\"Perhaps we have arrived before her!\"\n\nCaptain Mangles shook his head. He knew Tom Austin; his mate would\nnever have delayed so long to execute an order.\n\n\"I will know what this means,\" said Glenarvan. \"Certainty is better\nthan doubt.\"\n\n[Sidenote: THE LAST HOPE.]\n\nFifteen minutes later a telegram was sent to the ship-brokers of\nMelbourne, and the travelers repaired to the Victoria Hotel. Not long\nafter an answer was delivered to Lord Glenarvan. It read as follows:\n\n\"Lord Glenarvan,\n            Eden, Twofold Bay.\n\n\"Duncan started on the 18th instant for some unknown destination.\"\n\nThe dispatch fell from Glenarvan's hands. There was no more doubt! The\nhonest Scotch yacht, in Ben Joyce's hands, had become a pirate-vessel!\n\nThus ended their search in Australia, begun under such favorable\nauspices. The traces of Captain Grant and his shipwrecked sailors\nseemed irrecoverably lost. This failure had cost the lives of an entire\ncrew. Lord Glenarvan was crushed by the blow, and this courageous\nsearcher, whom the leagued elements had failed to deter, was now\nbaffled by the malice of men.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIV.\n\nA ROUGH CAPTAIN.\n\n\nIf ever the searchers for Captain Grant had reason to despair of seeing\nhim again, was it not when every hope forsook them at once? To what\npart of the world should they venture a new expedition? how explore\nunknown countries? The Duncan was no longer in their possession, and\nthey could not be immediately reconciled to their misfortune.

Is it not so,\nJohn?\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly, your lordship,\" replied the young captain; \"and yet, I\nconfess, Miss Grant is better in her place on deck, than taking a reef\nin the top-sail. But still I am very much flattered to hear her speak\nso.\"\n\n\"And especially when she admires the Duncan!\" added Glenarvan.\n\n\"Right, my lord; for she deserves it.\"\n\n\"Upon my word,\" said Lady Helena, \"since you are so proud of your\nyacht, you make me anxious to examine her to the very hold, and see how\nour brave sailors are quartered between-decks.\"\n\n\"Admirably,\" replied the captain; \"they are quite at home there.\"\n\n\"Indeed they are, my dear Helena,\" said Lord Glenarvan. \"This yacht\nis a part of our old Caledonia,--a detached portion of the county of\nDumbarton, traveling by special favor, so that we have not left our\ncountry.

Enveloped in a dense cloud of smoke,\nhe stood motionless, gazing back at the wake of the yacht. After a few\nmoments of contemplation, he turned and found himself face to face with\na new character. If _anything_ could have surprised him, it must have\nbeen this meeting, for the passenger was absolutely unknown to him.\n\n[Sidenote: A TELESCOPIC APPARITION.]\n\nThis man, tall, lank, and shriveled, might have been forty years old.\nHe resembled a long, broad-headed nail, for his head was large and\nthick, his forehead high, his nose prominent, his mouth wide, and\nhis chin blunt. As for his eyes, they were hidden behind enormous\neye-glasses, and his look seemed to have that indecision peculiar\nto nyctalops. His countenance indicated an intelligent and lively\nperson, while it had not the crabbed air of those stern people who from\nprinciple never laugh, and whose stupidity is hidden beneath a serious\nguise. The nonchalance and amiable freedom of this unknown nonentity\nclearly proved that he knew how to take men and things at their best\nadvantage. Even without his speaking you felt that he was a talker; but\nhe was abstracted, after the manner of those who do not see what they\nare looking at or hear what they are listening to. He wore a traveling\ncap, stout yellow buskins and leather gaiters, pantaloons of maroon\nvelvet, and a jacket of the same material, whose innumerable pockets\nseemed stuffed with note-books, memoranda, scraps, portfolios, and a\nthousand articles as inconvenient as they were useless, not to speak\nof a telescope which he carried in a sling.\n\nThe curiosity of this unk"}, {"chunk_id": 172, "text": "captain seized the sailor's hand.\n\n\"The surf!\" said he.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Wilson. \"The sea is breaking on the reefs.\"\n\n\"Not more than two cable-lengths distant.\"\n\n\"Not more! The shore is here!\"\n\nCaptain Mangles leaned over the railing, gazed at the dark waves, and\ncried:\n\n\"The sounding-lead, Wilson!\"\n\nThe skipper, who was in the forecastle, did not seem to suspect his\nsituation. Wilson grasped the sounding-line, which lay coiled in its\npail, and rushed into the port-shrouds. He cast the lead; the rope\nslipped between his fingers; at the third knot it stopped.\n\n\"Three fathoms!\" cried Wilson.\n\n\"We are on the breakers!\" shouted the sober captain to the stupefied\none.\n\nWhether the former saw Halley shrug his shoulders or not is of little\nconsequence. At all events, he rushed towards the wheel and crowded\nthe helm hard alee, while Wilson, letting go the line, hauled upon the\ntop-sail yard-arms to luff the ship. The sailor who was steering, and\nhad been forcibly pushed aside, did not at all understand this sudden\nattack.\n\n\"To the port-yards! let loose the sails!\" cried the young captain,\nmanaging so as to escape the reefs.\n\nFor half a minute, the starboard side of the brig grazed the rocks,\nand, in spite of the darkness, John perceived a roaring line of\nbreakers that foamed a few yards from the ship.\n\n[Sidenote: VERY CRITICAL CIRCUMSTANCES.]\n\nAt this moment Will Halley, becoming conscious of the imminent danger,\nlost his presence of mind. His sailors, who were scarcely sober,\ncould not comprehend his orders. Moreover, his incoherent words and\ncontradictory commands showed that this stupid drunkard's coolness\nhad failed. He was surprised by the nearness of the land, which was\nonly eight miles off, when he thought it thirty or forty. The currents\nhad taken him unawares, and thrown him out of his ordinary course.\n\n[Illustration: The sailor who was steering, and had been forcibly\npushed aside, did not at all understand this sudden attack.]\n\nHowever, Captain Mangles's prompt management had rescued the brig from\nher peril; but he did not know his position. Perhaps he was inclosed by\na chain of reefs. The wind blew fresh from the east, and at every pitch\nthey might strike bottom.\n\nThe roar of the surf was soon redoubled, and it was necessary to luff\nstill more. John crowded the helm down and braced farther to leeward.\nThe breakers multiplied beneath the prow of the ship, and they were\nobliged to tack so as to put to sea. Would this manoeuvre succeed with\nsuch an unsteady vessel, and under such reduced sail? It was uncertain,\nbut as their only chance they must venture it.\n\n\"Hard alee!\" cried Captain Mangles to Wilson.\n\nThe Macquarie began to approach the new line of reefs. Soon the\nwater foamed above the submerged rocks. It was a moment of torturing\nsuspense. The spray glittered on the crests of the waves. You would\nhave thought a phosphorescent glow had suddenly illumined the water.\nWilson and Mulready forced down the wheel with their whole weight.\n\nSuddenly a shock was felt. The vessel had struck upon a rock. The\nbob-stays broke, and nearly overthrew the mainmast. Could they come\nabout without any other injury? No; for all at once there was a calm,\nand the ship veered to windward again, and her movements suddenly\nceased. A lofty wave seized and bore her forward towards the reefs,\nwhile she rolled heavily. The mainmast went by the board with all its\nrigging, the brig heaved twice and was motionless, leaning over to\nstarboard. The pump-lights were shattered in pieces, and the passengers\nrushed to the deck; but the waves were sweeping it from one end to\nthe other, and they could not remain without danger. Captain Mangles,\nknowing that the ship was firmly imbedded in the sand, besought them\nfor their own sakes to go below again.\n\n\"The truth, John?\" asked Glenarvan, faintly.\n\n\"The truth, my lord, is that we shall not founder. As for being\ndestroyed by the sea, that is another question; but we have time to\ntake counsel.\"\n\n\"Is it midnight?\"\n\n\"Yes,"}]}

People seemed as though they could not show him enough\nattention.\n\nJust at this time an amiable lady of thirty, none other than the\nmajor's cousin, a little eccentric herself, but still agreeable and\ncharming, fell in love with the geographer's peculiarities. Paganel was\nfar from being insensible to Miss Arabella's attractions, yet did not\ndare to declare his sentiments. The major accordingly undertook the\npart of Cupid's messenger between these two congenial hearts, and even\ntold Paganel that marriage was \"the last blunder\" that he could commit.\nBut the geographer was very much embarrassed, and, strangely enough,\ncould not summon courage to speak for himself.\n\n[Illustration: Early in the afternoon the travelers reached Malcolm\nCastle, amidst the hurrahs of their tenantry and friends.]\n\n\"Does not Miss Arabella please you?\" MacNabb would say to him.\n\n\"Oh, major, she is charming!\" cried Paganel,--\"a thousand times too\ncharming for me; and, if I must tell you, would please me better if she\nwere less so.

In spite of the\nrepresentations of his friends, he dared not go back to France, for\nfear of exposing the whole Geographical Society in his person to the\njests and railleries of the caricaturists.\n\nThe return of Captain Grant to Scotland was welcomed as a cause for\nnational rejoicing, and he became the popular man of old Caledonia.

The geographer studied this time without a\nbook, and was often heard repeating words aloud.\n\n\"If I do not get the accent,\" said he to the major, \"you must not be\nangry with me.

The slope was gradual, and the travelers had only to descend\na gentle declivity to the sea.\n\nWhen the Patagonian declined the horse that Glenarvan offered him, the\nlatter thought that he preferred to go on foot, according to the custom\nof certain guides; and indeed, his long legs ought to have made walking\neasy. But he was mistaken.\n\nAt the moment of departure Thalcave whistled in a peculiar manner.\nImmediately a magnificent Argentine horse, of superb form, issued from\na small wood near by, and approached at the call of his master. The\nanimal was perfectly beautiful. His brown color indicated a sound,\nspirited and courageous beast. He had a small and elegantly poised\nhead, widely opening nostrils, a fiery eye, large hams, swelling\nwithers, broad breast, long pasterns, in short, all the qualities that\nconstitute strength and suppleness. The major, like a perfect horseman,\nadmired unreservedly this specimen of the horses of the plains. This\nbeautiful creature was called Thaouka, which means \"bird\" in the\nPatagonian language, and he justly merited this appellation.\n\n[Sidenote: A FRESH START.]\n\nWhen Thalcave was in the saddle, the horse pranced with spirited grace,\nand the Patagonian, a skillful rider, was magnificent to behold. His\noutfit comprised two weapons of the chase, the \"bolas\" and the lasso.\nThe bolas consists of three balls tied together by a leathern string,\nwhich are fastened to the front of the saddle. The Indians frequently\nthrow them the distance of a hundred paces at the animal or enemy that\nthey are pursuing, and with such precision that they twist about their\nlegs and bring them to the ground. It is, therefore, in their hands a\nformidable instrument, and they handle it with surprising dexterity.\nThe lasso, on the contrary, does not leave the hand that wields it. It\nconsists simply of a leathern thong thirty feet in length, terminating\nin a slip-noose which works upon an iron ring. The right hand throws\nthe slip-noose, while the left hand holds the remainder of the lasso,\nthe end of which is firmly tied to the saddle. A long carbine in a\nsling completed the Patagonian's armament.\n\nThalcave, without observing the admiration caused by his natural\ngrace, ease and courage, took the lead, and the party advanced, now\nat a gallop, and now at a walk, for their horses seemed entirely\nunaccustomed to trotting. Robert mounted with much boldness, and\nspeedily convinced Glenarvan of his ability to keep his seat.\n\nOn issuing from the gorges of the Andes, they encountered a great\nnumber of sand-ridges, called \"medanos,\" real waves incessantly\nagitated by the wind, when the roots of the herbage did not confine\nthem to the earth. This sand is of an extreme fineness; and, at the\nleast breath, they saw it float away in light clouds, or form regular\nsand-columns which rose to a considerable height. This spectacle caused\npleasure as well as annoyance to the eyes. Pleasure, for nothing was\nmore curious than these columns, wandering over the plain, struggling,\nmingling, sinking and rising in inexpressible confusion; and annoyance,\nsince an impalpable dust emanated from these innumerable medanos and\npenetrated the eyelids, however tightly they were closed.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThis phenomenon continued during a great part of the day.

When you\nare a man you will be quite like him!\"\n\n\"God grant it, Mary!\" said Robert, glowing with holy and filial pride.\n\n\"But how shall we pay our debt to Lord and Lady Glenarvan?\" continued\nMary.\n\n\"Oh, that will not be difficult,\" answered Robert, with his boyish\nimpulsiveness. \"We will tell them how much we love and respect them,\nand we will show it to them by our actions.\"\n\n\"That is all we can do!\" added the young girl, covering her brother's\nface with kisses; \"and all that they will like, too!\"\n\nThen, relapsing into reveries, the two children of the captain gazed\nsilently into the shadowy obscurity of the night. However, in fancy\nthey still conversed, questioned, and answered each other. The sea\nrocked the ship in silence, and the phosphorescent waters glistened in\nthe darkness.\n\nBut now a strange, a seemingly supernatural event took place. The\nbrother and sister, by one of those magnetic attractions that\nmysteriously draw the souls of friends together, experienced at the\nsame instant the same curious hallucination.\n\n[Sidenote: \"METHOUGHT, THE BILLOWS SPOKE!\"]\n\nFrom the midst of these alternately brightening and darkening waves,\nthey thought they heard a voice issue, whose depth of sadness stirred\nevery fibre of their hearts.\n\n\"Help! help!\" cried the voice.\n\n\"Mary,\" said Robert, \"did you hear?"}, {"chunk_id": 74, "text": " Paganel, were arrested by the curious illusion of\nthe mirage, by which was presented in the sky, at the limits of the\nhorizon, a semblance of the estancias, the poplars and willows near\nthem, and other objects; the images being so much like the reality that\nit required a strong effort to realize their deceptive character.\n\nThe weather hitherto had been fine, but now the sky assumed a less\npleasing aspect. Masses of vapor, generated by the high temperature\nof the preceding days, condensed into thick clouds and threatened to\ndissolve in showers of rain. Moreover, the proximity of the Atlantic,\nand the west wind, which here reigns supreme, rendered the climate of\nthis region peculiarly moist. However, for that day at least the heavy\nclouds did not break; and at evening the horses, after traveling forty\nmiles, halted on the edge of a deep \"cañada,\" an immense natural ditch\nfilled with water. A shelter was wanting, but the ponchos served for\ntents as well as clothing, and peaceful slumbers enwrapped all.\n\nThe next day, as they progressed farther, the presence of subterranean\nstreams betrayed itself more noticeably, and moisture was seen in every\ndepression of the ground. Soon they came to large ponds, some already\ndeep and others just forming. So long as there were only lagoons, the\nhorses could easily extricate themselves; but with these treacherous\nswamps it was more difficult. Tall grass obstructed them, and it was\nnecessary to incur the danger before it could be understood. These\nquagmires had been already fatal to more than one human being.\n\nRobert, who had ridden half a mile in advance, returned at a gallop,\ncrying,--\n\n\"Monsieur Paganel! Monsieur Paganel! A forest of horns!\"\n\n\"What!\" replied the geographer, \"have you found a forest of horns?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes; or at least a field.\"\n\n\"A field! you are dreaming, my boy,\" said Paganel, shrugging his\nshoulders.\n\n\"I am not dreaming,\" retorted Robert; \"you shall see for yourself. This\nis a strange country! People sow horns, and they spring up like corn! I\nshould like very well to have some of the seed.\"\n\n\"But he speaks seriously,\" said the major.\n\n\"Yes, major, you shall see.\"\n\nRobert was not mistaken, and soon they found themselves before a vast\nfield of horns, regularly planted.\n\n\"Well?\" said Robert.\n\n\"This is something singular,\" replied Paganel, turning towards the\nIndian with a questioning look.\n\n[Sidenote: AN ANXIOUS INDIAN.]\n\n\"The horns come from the ground,\" explained Thalcave; \"and the cattle\nare under it.\"\n\n\"What!\" cried Paganel, \"is there a whole drove in this mire?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered the Patagonian.\n\nIn fact, a vast herd had perished in this bog, which had given way\nbeneath them. Hundreds of cattle had thus met their death, side by\nside, by suffocation in this vast quagmire. This circumstance, which\nsometimes takes place on the plains, could not be ignored by the\nIndian, and it was a warning which it was proper to heed. They passed\naround this immense hecatomb, which would have satisfied the most\nexacting gods of antiquity; and an hour after the field of horns was\nfar behind.\n\nThalcave now began to observe with an anxious air the state of things\naround him. He frequently stopped, and rose in his stirrups. His tall\nform enabled him to survey a wide range; but, perceiving nothing that\ncould enlighten him, he resumed his undeviating course. A mile farther,\nhe stopped again, and, turning from the beaten track, proceeded a short\ndistance, first to the north, then to the south, and then resumed his\nplace at the head of the party, without saying either what he hoped or\nwhat he feared.\n\nThese manoeuvres, many times repeated, puzzled Paganel and annoyed\nGlenarvan. The geographer was accordingly requested to interrogate\nthe Indian, which he did at once. Thalcave replied that he was\nastonished to see the plain so soaked with moisture. Never within his\nrecollection, since he had performed the office of guide, had his feet\ntrodden a soil so saturated. Even in the season of the great rains "}, {"chunk_id": 49, "text": "short.\n\n\"Major, you are going a little too far,\" said Paganel in a very dry\ntone.\n\n\"To be sure, since you do not understand.\"\n\n\"I do not understand because this native speaks so badly!\" answered the\ngeographer, who began to be impatient.\n\n\"That is to say, he speaks badly, because you do not understand,\"\nreturned the major, calmly.\n\n\"MacNabb,\" said Glenarvan, \"that is not a probable supposition. However\nabstracted our friend Paganel may be, we cannot suppose that his\nblunder was to learn one language for another.\"\n\n\"Now, my dear Edward, or rather you, my good Paganel, explain to me\nwhat the difficulty is.\"\n\n\"I will not explain,\" replied Paganel, \"I insist. Here is the book\nin which I practice daily the difficulties of the Spanish language!\nExamine it, major, and you will see whether I impose upon you.\"\n\nSo saying, Paganel groped in his numerous pockets. After searching a\nfew moments, he drew forth a volume in a very bad state, and presented\nit with an air of assurance. The major took the book, and looked at it.\n\n\"Well, what work is this?\" he asked.\n\n\"The Lusiad,\" replied Paganel; \"an admirable poem which----\"\n\n\"The Lusiad!\" cried Glenarvan.\n\n\"Yes, my friend, the Lusiad of the immortal Camoëns, nothing more or\nless.\"\n\n\"Camoëns!\" repeated Glenarvan; \"but, unfortunate friend, Camoëns was\na Portuguese! It is Portuguese that you have been studying for six\nweeks.\"\n\n\"Camoëns! Lusiad! Portuguese!\"\n\nPaganel could say no more. His eyes wandered, while a peal of Homeric\nlaughter rang in his ears.\n\nThe Patagonian did not wink; he waited patiently for the explanation of\nthis event, which was totally incomprehensible to him.\n\n\"Insensate! fool!\" cried Paganel, at last. \"What! is it so? Is it not\na mere joke? Have I done this? It is the confusion of languages, as at\nBabel. My friends! my friends! to start for India and arrive at Chili!\nto learn Spanish and speak Portuguese! this is too much, and, if it\ncontinues, I shall some day throw myself out of the window instead of\nmy cigar.\"\n\nTo hear Paganel take his blunder thus, to see his comical actions, it\nwas impossible to keep serious. Besides, he set the example himself.\n\n\"Laugh, my friends,\" said he, \"laugh with a will! you cannot laugh as\nmuch as I do at myself.\"\n\nAnd he uttered the most formidable peal of laughter that ever issued\nfrom the mouth of a geographer.\n\n\"But we are none the less without an interpreter,\" said the major.\n\n\"Oh, do not be troubled,\" replied Paganel. \"The Portuguese and Spanish\nresemble each other so much that I made a mistake. However, this very\nresemblance will soon enable me to rectify my error, and in a short\ntime I will thank this worthy Patagonian in the language he speaks so\nwell.\"\n\nPaganel was right, for he could soon exchange a few words with the\nnative. He even learned that his name was Thalcave, a word which\nsignifies in Araucanian \"the thunderer.\" This surname was doubtless\ngiven to him for his skill in the use of fire-arms.\n\n[Sidenote: BETTER PROSPECTS.]\n\nBut Glenarvan was particularly rejoiced to discover that the Patagonian\nwas a guide, and, moreover, a guide of the Pampas. There was,\ntherefore, something so providential in this meeting that the success\nof the enterprise seemed already an accomplished fact, and no one any\nlonger doubted the rescue of Captain Grant.\n\nIn the meantime the travelers and the Patagonian had returned to\nRobert. The latter stretched his arms towards the native, who, without\na word, placed his hand upon his head. He examined the child and felt\nhis wounded limbs. Then, smiling, he went and gathered on the banks\nof the stream a few handfuls of wild celery, with which he rubbed the\nboy's body. Under this treatment, performed with an extreme gentleness,\nthe child felt his strength revive, and it was plain that a few hours\nwould suffice to restore him.\n\nIt was therefore decided that that day and the following night should\nbe passed at the encampment. Besides, two important questions remained\nto be settled--food, and means of conveyance."}]}

It is Maria Theresa.\"\n\n\"Certainly, Mr. Paganel,\" replied Harry Grant; \"Maria Theresa on the\nEnglish and German, but Tabor on the French maps.\"\n\nAt this moment a vigorous blow descended upon Paganel's shoulder. Truth\ncompels us to say that it was from the major, who now failed in his\nstrict habits of propriety.\n\n\"A fine geographer you are!\" said MacNabb, in a tone of badinage. \"But\nno matter, since we have succeeded.\"\n\n\"No matter?\" cried Paganel; \"I ought never to have forgotten that\ntwofold appellation! It is an unpardonable mistake, unworthy of the\nsecretary of a Geographical Society. I am disgraced!\"\n\nWhen the meal was finished, Harry Grant put everything in order in his\nhouse. He took nothing away, for he was willing that the guilty convict\nshould inherit his possessions.\n\nThey returned to the vessel; and, as he expected to sail the same day,\nGlenarvan gave orders for the quartermaster's landing. Ayrton was\nbrought on deck, and found himself in the presence of Harry Grant.\n\n\"It is I, Ayrton,\" said he.\n\n\"Yes, captain,\" replied Ayrton, without betraying any astonishment at\nHarry Grant's appearance. \"Well, I am not sorry to see you again in\ngood health.\"\n\n[Illustration: The passengers could see the quartermaster, with folded\narms, standing motionless as a statue, on a rock, and gazing at the\nvessel.]\n\n\"It seems, Ayrton, that I made a mistake in landing you on an inhabited\ncoast.\"\n\n\"It seems so, captain.\"\n\n\"You will take my place on this desert island. May Heaven lead you to\nrepentance!\"\n\n\"May it be so,\" rejoined Ayrton, in a calm tone.\n\nThen Glenarvan, addressing the quartermaster, said:\n\n\"Do you still adhere, Ayrton, to this determination to be abandoned?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord.\"\n\n\"Does Tabor Island suit you?\"\n\n\"Perfectly.\"\n\n\"Now listen to my last words. You will be far removed from every land,\nand deprived of all communication with your fellow-men. Miracles are\nrare, and you will not probably remove from this island, where we leave\nyou. You will be alone, under the eye of God, who reads the uttermost\ndepths of all hearts; but you will not be lost, as was Captain Grant.\nHowever unworthy you may be of the remembrance of men, still they will\nremember you. I know where you are, and will never forget you.\"\n\n\"Thank you, my lord!\" replied Ayrton, simply.\n\nSuch were the last words exchanged between Glenarvan and the\nquartermaster. The boat was ready, and Ayrton embarked. Captain Mangles\nhad previously sent to the island several cases of preserved food, some\nclothes, tools, weapons, and a supply of powder and shot. The abandoned\nman could therefore employ his time to advantage. Nothing was wanting,\nnot even books, foremost among which was a Bible.\n\nThe hour for separation had come. The crew and passenge"}, {"chunk_id": 184, "text": ", and\na long beak or bill like that of a woodcock, and small white feathers\nall over its body. Of this bird there was then an entire absence in the\nzoological collections of Europe, and Paganel indulged the hope that he\nmight be able to be the proud contributor of such a valuable specimen\nto the \"Jardin\" of his own city. For the present, at least, the\nrealization of his hopes had to be deferred; and at length, after some\ndays of weariness and continued travel, the party reached the banks\nof the Waipa. The country was deserted. There was no sign of natives,\nno path that would indicate the presence of man in these regions. The\nwaters of the river flowed between tall bushes, or glided over sandy\nshallows, while the range of vision extended to the hills that inclosed\nthe valley on the east.\n\nAt four o'clock in the afternoon nine miles had been valiantly\naccomplished. According to the map, which Paganel continually\nconsulted, the junction of the Waikato and Waipa could not be more\nthan five miles distant. The road to Auckland passed this point, and\nthere they would encamp for the night. As for the fifty miles that\nwould still separate them from the capital, two or three days would\nbe sufficient for this, and even eight hours, if they should meet the\nmail-coach.\n\n\"Then,\" said Glenarvan, \"we shall be compelled to encamp again\nto-night.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Paganel; \"but, as I hope, for the last time.\"\n\n\"So much the better; for these are severe hardships for Lady Helena and\nMary Grant.\"\n\n\"And they endure them heroically,\" added Captain Mangles. \"But, if I am\nnot mistaken, Mr. Paganel, you have spoken of a village situated at the\njunction of the two rivers.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered the geographer; \"here it is on the map. It is\nNgarnavahia, about two miles below the junction.\"\n\n\"Well, could we not lodge there for the night? Lady Helena and Miss\nGrant would not hesitate to go two miles farther, if they could find a\ntolerable hotel.\"\n\n\"A hotel!\" cried Paganel. \"A hotel in a Maori village! There is not\neven a tavern. This village is only a collection of native huts;\nand, far from seeking shelter there, my advice is to avoid it most\ncarefully.\"\n\n\"Always your fears, Paganel!\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\"My dear lord, distrust is better than confidence among the Maoris. I\ndo not know upon what terms they are with the English. Now, timidity\naside, such as ourselves would be fine prizes, and I dislike to try New\nZealand hospitality. I therefore think it wise to avoid this village,\nand likewise any meeting with the natives. Once at Drury, it will be\ndifferent, and there our courageous ladies can refresh themselves at\ntheir ease for the fatigues of their journey.\"\n\nThe geographer's opinion prevailed. Lady Helena preferred to pass\nthe last night in the open air rather than to expose her companions.\nNeither she nor Mary Grant required a halt, and they therefore\ncontinued to follow the banks of the river.\n\nTwo hours after, the first shadows of evening began to descend the\nmountains. The sun before disappearing below the western horizon had\nglinted a few rays through a rift in the clouds. The eastern peaks were\ncrimsoned with the last beams of day.\n\nGlenarvan and his friends hastened their pace. They knew the shortness\nof the twilight in this latitude, and how quickly night sets in. It\nwas important to reach the junction of the two rivers before it became\ndark. But a dense fog rose from the earth, and made it very difficult\nto distinguish the way.\n\nFortunately, hearing availed in place of sight. Soon a distinct murmur\nof the waters indicated the union of the two streams in a common bed,\nand not long after the little party arrived at the point where the\nWaipa mingles with the Waikato in resounding cascades.\n\n\"Here is the Waikato,\" cried Paganel, \"and the road to Auckland runs\nalong its right bank.\"\n\n\"We shall see to-morrow,\" replied the major. \"Let us encamp here. It\nseems to me as if those deeper shadows yonder proceeded from a little\nthicket of trees that has grown here"}, {"chunk_id": 112, "text": "m to attach so much importance as did Captain\nMangles. When he stopped, Mary said, in her sweet voice,--\n\n\"Mr. Ayrton, please tell us more about our father.\"\n\nAyrton acceded to the young girl's request. Glenarvan was reluctant to\ninterrupt him, and yet many more important questions thronged his mind.\nBut Lady Helena, pointing out to him Mary's joyful excitement, checked\nhis inquiries.\n\n[Sidenote: TWO YEARS OF SLAVERY.]\n\nThe quartermaster now told the story of the Britannia and her voyage\nacross the Pacific. During the period of a year Harry Grant landed\nat the principal ports of Oceanica, opposing unjustifiable captures,\nand often a victim to the hostility of unjust traders. He found,\nhowever, an important point on the western coast of Papua. Here the\nestablishment of a Scottish colony appeared to him feasible, and its\nprosperity assured. After examining Papua, the Britannia sailed to\nCallao for provisions, and left that port on the 30th of May, 1862, to\nreturn to Europe by the way of the Indian Ocean and the Cape. Three\nweeks after her departure, a terrible tempest disabled her. It became\nnecessary to cut away the masts. A leak was discovered in the hold,\nwhich they did not succeed in stopping. The crew were soon overtasked\nand exhausted. The pumps could not be worked. For eight days the\nvessel was at the mercy of the storm. There were six feet of water\nin her hold, and she gradually foundered. The boats had been washed\noverboard, and the crew had given themselves up for lost, when on the\nnight of June 22nd, as Paganel had rightly interpreted, they descried\nthe eastern coast of Australia. The vessel soon stranded. A violent\nshock was felt. At this moment Ayrton, borne by a wave, was cast into\nthe midst of the breakers, and lost all consciousness. When he came to\nhimself, he was in the hands of the natives, who carried him into the\ninterior of the country. Since then he had heard nothing more of the\nBritannia, and naturally supposed that she had been wrecked, with all\non board, on the dangerous reefs of Twofold Bay.\n\nThis was Ayrton's story, which elicited more than once exclamations of\nsympathy. The major could not justly doubt its correctness; and after\nthis recital the quartermaster's own experiences possessed a more real\ninterest. Indeed, thanks to the document, they no longer doubted that\nCaptain Grant had survived the shipwreck with two of his sailors. From\nthe fate of the one they could fairly conjecture that of the other.\n\nAyrton was invited to tell of his own adventures, which was soon and\nsimply done. The shipwrecked sailor, prisoner of a native tribe, was\ncarried into the interior regions watered by the Darling. Here he led\na very wretched existence, because the tribe itself was miserable; but\nhe was not maltreated. For two long years he endured a painful slavery.\nHowever, the hope of regaining his liberty sustained his courage. He\nwatched for the least opportunity of escaping, although his flight\nwould plunge him into the midst of innumerable perils. One night\nin October he eluded the vigilance of the natives, and took refuge\nin the depths of extensive forests. For a month, living on roots,\nedible ferns, and the gum of the mimosa, often overcome by despair,\nhe wandered in those vast solitudes, with the sun as his guide by\nday and the stars by night. In this way he crossed marshes, rivers,\nmountains, in short, all that uninhabited portion of country that few\ntravelers have explored. At last, exhausted and almost dead, he reached\nthe hospitable dwelling of Mr. O'Moore, where his labor insured him a\ncomfortable livelihood.\n\n\"And if Ayrton is pleased with me,\" said the Irish colonist, when the\nstory was finished, \"I cannot but be pleased with him. He is an honest\nand intelligent man, a good worker, and, if he chooses, this house\nshall long be at his service.\"\n\nAyrton thanked Mr. O'Moore, and waited for further questions. He\nprobably thought, however, that the legitimate curiosity of his hearers\nought to be satisfied. W"}, {"chunk_id": 51, "text": " Paganel, he did not leave the Indian. He became Thalcave's\nshadow, and could not remain quiet in the presence of a real\nPatagonian, in comparison with whom he would have passed for a dwarf.\nHe overwhelmed the grave Indian with Spanish phrases, to which the\nlatter quietly listened. The geographer studied this time without a\nbook, and was often heard repeating words aloud.\n\n\"If I do not get the accent,\" said he to the major, \"you must not be\nangry with me. Who would have thought that one day a Patagonian would\nteach me Spanish!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\nNEWS OF THE LOST CAPTAIN.\n\n\nAt eight o'clock the next morning Thalcave gave the signal for\ndeparture. The slope was gradual, and the travelers had only to descend\na gentle declivity to the sea.\n\nWhen the Patagonian declined the horse that Glenarvan offered him, the\nlatter thought that he preferred to go on foot, according to the custom\nof certain guides; and indeed, his long legs ought to have made walking\neasy. But he was mistaken.\n\nAt the moment of departure Thalcave whistled in a peculiar manner.\nImmediately a magnificent Argentine horse, of superb form, issued from\na small wood near by, and approached at the call of his master. The\nanimal was perfectly beautiful. His brown color indicated a sound,\nspirited and courageous beast. He had a small and elegantly poised\nhead, widely opening nostrils, a fiery eye, large hams, swelling\nwithers, broad breast, long pasterns, in short, all the qualities that\nconstitute strength and suppleness. The major, like a perfect horseman,\nadmired unreservedly this specimen of the horses of the plains. This\nbeautiful creature was called Thaouka, which means \"bird\" in the\nPatagonian language, and he justly merited this appellation.\n\n[Sidenote: A FRESH START.]\n\nWhen Thalcave was in the saddle, the horse pranced with spirited grace,\nand the Patagonian, a skillful rider, was magnificent to behold. His\noutfit comprised two weapons of the chase, the \"bolas\" and the lasso.\nThe bolas consists of three balls tied together by a leathern string,\nwhich are fastened to the front of the saddle. The Indians frequently\nthrow them the distance of a hundred paces at the animal or enemy that\nthey are pursuing, and with such precision that they twist about their\nlegs and bring them to the ground. It is, therefore, in their hands a\nformidable instrument, and they handle it with surprising dexterity.\nThe lasso, on the contrary, does not leave the hand that wields it. It\nconsists simply of a leathern thong thirty feet in length, terminating\nin a slip-noose which works upon an iron ring. The right hand throws\nthe slip-noose, while the left hand holds the remainder of the lasso,\nthe end of which is firmly tied to the saddle. A long carbine in a\nsling completed the Patagonian's armament.\n\nThalcave, without observing the admiration caused by his natural\ngrace, ease and courage, took the lead, and the party advanced, now\nat a gallop, and now at a walk, for their horses seemed entirely\nunaccustomed to trotting. Robert mounted with much boldness, and\nspeedily convinced Glenarvan of his ability to keep his seat.\n\nOn issuing from the gorges of the Andes, they encountered a great\nnumber of sand-ridges, called \"medanos,\" real waves incessantly\nagitated by the wind, when the roots of the herbage did not confine\nthem to the earth. This sand is of an extreme fineness; and, at the\nleast breath, they saw it float away in light clouds, or form regular\nsand-columns which rose to a considerable height. This spectacle caused\npleasure as well as annoyance to the eyes. Pleasure, for nothing was\nmore curious than these columns, wandering over the plain, struggling,\nmingling, sinking and rising in inexpressible confusion; and annoyance,\nsince an impalpable dust emanated from these innumerable medanos and\npenetrated the eyelids, however tightly they were closed.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThis phenomenon continued during a great part of the day.

The worthy geographer almost fell backwards. \"A rough little\ngentleman,\" said he; \"I will teach him geography.\" As Captain Mangles\nhad engaged to make him a sailor, Glenarvan a man of honor, the major a\nboy of coolness, Lady Helena a noble and generous being, and Mary Grant\na pupil grateful towards such patrons, Robert was evidently to become\none day an accomplished gentleman.\n\nThe Duncan soon finished shipping her coal, and then leaving these\ngloomy regions she gained the current from the southeast coast of\nBrazil, and, after crossing the equator with a fine breeze from the\nnorth, she entered the southern hemisphere. The passage was effected\nwithout difficulty, and every one had good hopes. On this voyage in\nsearch of Captain Grant, the probabilities increased every day. Their\ncaptain was one of the most confident on board; but his confidence\nproceeded especially from the desire that he cherished so strongly at\nheart, of seeing Miss Mary happy and consoled. He was particularly\ninterested in this young girl; and this feeling he concealed so well,\nthat, except Miss Grant and himself, no one on board the Duncan had\nperceived it.\n\nAs for the learned geographer, he was probably the happiest man in the\nsouthern hemisphere. He passed his time in studying the maps with which\nhe covered the cabin-table; and then followed daily discussions with\nMr. Olbinett, so that he could scarcely set the table.\n\nBut Paganel had all the passengers on his side except the major,\nwho was very indifferent to geographical questions, especially at\ndinner-time. Having discovered a whole cargo of odd books in the mate's\nchests, and among them a number of Cervantes' works, the Frenchman\nresolved to learn Spanish, which nobody on board knew, and which would\nfacilitate his search on the shores of Chili. Thanks to his love for\nphilology, he did not despair of speaking this new tongue fluently on\narriving at Concepcion. He therefore studied assiduously, and was heard\nincessantly muttering heterogeneous syllables. During his leisure hours\nhe did not fail to give young Robert practical instruction, and taught\nhim the history of the country they were rapidly approaching.\n\nIn the meantime the Duncan was proceeding at a remarkable rate. She\ncut the Tropic of Capricorn, and her prow was headed toward the strait\nof the celebrated geographer.

Keep your journey a secret; do not boast of what you have\ncome to Paris to do, or have done; return with all speed; enter\nMarseilles at night, and your house by the back-door, and there remain,\nquiet, submissive, secret, and, above all, inoffensive; for this time,\nI swear to you, we shall act like powerful men who know their enemies.\nGo, my son—go, my dear Gérard, and by your obedience to my paternal\norders, or, if you prefer it, friendly counsels, we will keep you in\nyour place.

Villefort, pale and agitated, ran to the window,\nput aside the curtain, and saw him pass, cool and collected, by two or\nthree ill-looking men at the corner of the street, who were there,\nperhaps, to arrest a man with black whiskers, and a blue frock-coat,\nand hat with broad brim.\n\nVillefort stood watching, breathless, until his father had disappeared\nat the Rue Bussy.

The Hundred Days\n\nM. Noirtier was a true prophet, and things progressed rapidly, as he\nhad predicted. Everyone knows the history of the famous return from\nElba, a return which was unprecedented in the past, and will probably\nremain without a counterpart in the future.\n\nLouis XVIII. made but a faint attempt to parry this unexpected blow;\nthe monarchy he had scarcely reconstructed tottered on its precarious\nfoundation, and at a sign from the emperor the incongruous structure of\nancient prejudices and new ideas fell to the ground. Villefort,\ntherefore, gained nothing save the king’s gratitude (which was rather\nlikely to injure him at the present time) and the cross of the Legion\nof Honor, which he had the prudence not to wear, although M. de Blacas\nhad duly forwarded the brevet.\n\nNapoleon would, doubtless, have deprived Villefort of his office had it\nnot been for Noirtier, who was all powerful at court, and thus the\nGirondin of ’93 and the Senator of 1806 protected him who so lately had\nbeen his protector. All Villefort’s influence barely enabled him to\nstifle the secret Dantès had so nearly divulged. The king’s procureur\nalone was deprived of his office, being suspected of royalism.\n\nHowever, scarcely was the imperial power established—that is, scarcely\nhad the emperor re-entered the Tuileries and begun to issue orders from\nthe closet into which we have introduced our readers,—he found on the\ntable there Louis XVIII.’s half-filled snuff-box,—scarcely had this\noccurred when Marseilles began, in spite of the authorities, to\nrekindle the flames of civil war, always smouldering in the south, and\nit required but little to excite the populace to acts of far greater\nviolence than the shouts and insults with which they assailed the\nroyalists whenever they ventured abroad.\n\n0159m\n\n\n\nOwing to this change, the worthy shipowner became at that moment—we\nwill not say all powerful, because Morrel was a prudent and rather a\ntimid man, so much so, that many of the most zealous partisans of\nBonaparte accused him of “moderation”—but sufficiently influential to\nmake a demand in favor of Dantès.\n\nVillefort retained his place, but his marriage was put off until a more\nfavorable opportunity. If the emperor remained on the throne, Gérard\nrequired a different alliance to aid his career; if Louis XVIII.\nreturned, the influence of M. de Saint-Méran, like his own, could be\nvastly increased, and the marriage be still more suitable. The deputy\nprocureur was, therefore, the first magistrate of Marseilles, when one\nmorning his door opened, and M. Morrel was announced.\n\nAnyone else would have hastened to receive him; but Villefort was a man\nof ability, and he knew this would be a sign of weakness. He made\nMorrel wait in the antechamber, although he had no one with him, for\nthe simple reason that the king’s procureur always makes everyone wait,\nand after passing a quarter of an hour in reading the papers, he\nordered M. Morrel to be admitted.\n\nMorrel expected Villefort would be dejected; he found him as he had\nfound him six weeks before, calm, firm, and full of that glacial\npoliteness, that most insurmountable barrier which separates the\nwell-bred from the vulgar man.\n\nHe had entered Villefort’s office expecting that the magistrate would\ntremble at the sight of him; on the contrary, he felt a cold shudder\nall over him when he saw Villefort sitting there with his elbow on his\ndesk, and his head leaning on his hand. He stopped at the door;\nVillefort gazed at him as if he had some difficulty in recognizing him;\nthen, after a brief interval, during which the honest shipowner turned\nhis hat in his hands,\n\n“M. Morrel, I believe?” said Villefort.\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“Come nearer,” said the magistrate, with a patronizing wave of the\nhand, “and tell me to what circumstance I owe the honor of this visit.”\n\n“Do you not guess, monsieur?” asked Morrel.\n\n“Not in the least; but if I can serve you in any way I shall be\ndelighted.”\n"}, {"chunk_id": 31, "text": "hus called up; “but bear in mind, if you\nplease, that our respective parents underwent persecution and\nproscription from diametrically opposite principles; in proof of which\nI may remark, that while my family remained among the staunchest\nadherents of the exiled princes, your father lost no time in joining\nthe new government; and that while the Citizen Noirtier was a Girondin,\nthe Count Noirtier became a senator.”\n\n“Dear mother,” interposed Renée, “you know very well it was agreed that\nall these disagreeable reminiscences should forever be laid aside.”\n\n“Suffer me, also, madame,” replied Villefort, “to add my earnest\nrequest to Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran’s, that you will kindly allow\nthe veil of oblivion to cover and conceal the past. What avails\nrecrimination over matters wholly past recall? For my own part, I have\nlaid aside even the name of my father, and altogether disown his\npolitical principles.

Come,\nnow, I have hopes of obtaining what I have been for years endeavoring\nto persuade the marquise to promise; namely, a perfect amnesty and\nforgetfulness of the past.”\n\n“With all my heart,” replied the marquise; “let the past be forever\nforgotten. I promise you it affords _me_ as little pleasure to revive\nit as it does you. All I ask is, that Villefort will be firm and\ninflexible for the future in his political principles. Remember, also,\nVillefort, that we have pledged ourselves to his majesty for your\nfealty and strict loyalty, and that at our recommendation the king\nconsented to forget the past, as I do” (and here she extended to him\nher hand)—“as I now do at your entreaty. But bear in mind, that should\nthere fall in your way anyone guilty of conspiring against the\ngovernment, you will be so much the more bound to visit the offence\nwith rigorous punishment, as it is known you belong to a suspected\nfamily.”\n\n“Alas, madame,” returned Villefort, “my profession, as well as the\ntimes in which we live, compels me to be severe. I have already\nsuccessfully conducted several public prosecutions, and brought the\noffenders to merited punishment. But we have not done with the thing\nyet.”\n\n0087m\n\n\n\n“Do you, indeed, think so?” inquired the marquise.\n\n“I am, at least, fearful of it. Napoleon, in the Island of Elba, is too\nnear France, and his proximity keeps up the hopes of his partisans.\nMarseilles is filled with half-pay officers, who are daily, under one\nfrivolous pretext or other, getting up quarrels with the royalists;\nfrom hence arise continual and fatal duels among the higher classes of\npersons, and assassinations in the lower.”\n\n“You have heard, perhaps,” said the Comte de Salvieux, one of M. de\nSaint-Méran’s oldest friends, and chamberlain to the Comte d’Artois,\n“that the Holy Alliance purpose removing him from thence?”\n\n“Yes; they were talking about it when we left Paris,” said M. de\nSaint-Méran; “and where is it decided to transfer him?”\n\n“To Saint Helena.”\n\n“For heaven’s sake, where is that?” asked the marquise.\n\n“An island situated on the other side of the equator, at least two\nthousand leagues from here,” replied the count.\n\n“So much the better. As Villefort observes, it is a great act of folly\nto have left such a man between Corsica, where he was born, and Naples,\nof which his brother-in-law is king, and face to face with Italy, the\nsovereignty of which he coveted for his son.”\n\n“Unfortunately,” said Villefort, “there are the treaties of 1814, and\nwe cannot molest Napoleon without breaking those compacts.”\n\n“Oh, well, we"}, {"chunk_id": 66, "text": "ounted the throne; Villefort, to whom Marseilles had\nbecome filled with remorseful memories, sought and obtained the\nsituation of king’s procureur at Toulouse, and a fortnight afterwards\nhe married Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran, whose father now stood higher\nat court than ever.\n\nAnd so Dantès, after the Hundred Days and after Waterloo, remained in\nhis dungeon, forgotten of earth and heaven.\n\nDanglars comprehended the full extent of the wretched fate that\noverwhelmed Dantès; and, when Napoleon returned to France, he, after\nthe manner of mediocre minds, termed the coincidence, _a decree of\nProvidence_. But when Napoleon returned to Paris, Danglars’ heart\nfailed him, and he lived in constant fear of Dantès’ return on a\nmission of vengeance. He therefore informed M. Morrel of his wish to\nquit the sea, and obtained a recommendation from him to a Spanish\nmerchant, into whose service he entered at the end of March, that is,\nten or twelve days after Napoleon’s return. He then left for Madrid,\nand was no more heard of.\n\nFernand understood nothing except that Dantès was absent. What had\nbecome of him he cared not to inquire. Only, during the respite the\nabsence of his rival afforded him, he reflected, partly on the means of\ndeceiving Mercédès as to the cause of his absence, partly on plans of\nemigration and abduction, as from time to time he sat sad and\nmotionless on the summit of Cape Pharo, at the spot from whence\nMarseilles and the Catalans are visible, watching for the apparition of\na young and handsome man, who was for him also the messenger of\nvengeance. Fernand’s mind was made up; he would shoot Dantès, and then\nkill himself. But Fernand was mistaken; a man of his disposition never\nkills himself, for he constantly hopes.\n\nDuring this time the empire made its last conscription, and every man\nin France capable of bearing arms rushed to obey the summons of the\nemperor. Fernand departed with the rest, bearing with him the terrible\nthought that while he was away, his rival would perhaps return and\nmarry Mercédès. Had Fernand really meant to kill himself, he would have\ndone so when he parted from Mercédès. His devotion, and the compassion\nhe showed for her misfortunes, produced the effect they always produce\non noble minds—Mercédès had always had a sincere regard for Fernand,\nand this was now strengthened by gratitude.\n\n“My brother,” said she, as she placed his knapsack on his shoulders,\n“be careful of yourself, for if you are killed, I shall be alone in the\nworld.” These words carried a ray of hope into Fernand’s heart. Should\nDantès not return, Mercédès might one day be his.\n\n0165m\n\n\n\nMercédès was left alone face to face with the vast plain that had never\nseemed so barren, and the sea that had never seemed so vast. Bathed in\ntears she wandered about the Catalan village. Sometimes she stood mute\nand motionless as a statue, looking towards Marseilles, at other times\ngazing on the sea, and debating as to whether it were not better to\ncast herself into the abyss of the ocean, and thus end her woes. It was\nnot want of courage that prevented her putting this resolution into\nexecution; but her religious feelings came to her aid and saved her.\n\nCaderousse was, like Fernand, enrolled in the army, but, being married\nand eight years older, he was merely sent to the frontier. Old Dantès,\nwho was only sustained by hope, lost all hope at Napoleon’s downfall.\nFive months after he had been separated from his son, and almost at the\nhour of his arrest, he breathed his last in Mercédès’ arms. M. Morrel\npaid the expenses of his funeral, and a few small debts the poor old\nman had contracted.\n\nThere was more than benevolence in this action; there was courage; the\nsouth was aflame, and to assist, even on his death-bed, the father of\nso dangerous a Bonapartist as Dantès, was stigmatized as a crime.\n\n\n\n Chapter 14.

I really must pray you to excuse me, but—in\ntruth—I was not attending to the conversation.”\n\n“Marquise, marquise!” interposed the old nobleman who had proposed the\ntoast, “let the young people alone; let me tell you, on one’s wedding\nday there are more agreeable subjects of conversation than dry\npolitics.”\n\n“Never mind, dearest mother,” said a young and lovely girl, with a\nprofusion of light brown hair, and eyes that seemed to float in liquid\ncrystal, “’tis all my fault for seizing upon M. de Villefort, so as to\nprevent his listening to what you said. But there—now take him—he is\nyour own for as long as you like. M. Villefort, I beg to remind you my\nmother speaks to you.”\n\n“If the marquise will deign to repeat the words I but imperfectly\ncaught, I shall be delighted to answer,” said M. de Villefort.\n\n“Never mind, Renée,” replied the marquise, with a look of tenderness\nthat seemed out of keeping with her harsh dry features; but, however\nall other feelings may be withered in a woman’s nature, there is always\none bright smiling spot in the desert of her heart, and that is the\nshrine of maternal love. “I forgive you. What I was saying, Villefort,\nwas, that the Bonapartists had not our sincerity, enthusiasm, or\ndevotion.”\n\n“They had, however, what supplied the place of those fine qualities,”\nreplied the young man, “and that was fanaticism. Napoleon is the\nMahomet of the West, and is worshipped by his commonplace but ambitious\nfollowers, not only as a leader and lawgiver, but also as the\npersonification of equality.”\n\n“He!” cried the marquise: “Napoleon the type of equality! For mercy’s\nsake, then, what would you call Robespierre? Come, come, do not strip\nthe latter of his just rights to bestow them on the Corsican, who, to\nmy mind, has usurped quite enough.”\n\n0085m\n\n\n\n“Nay, madame; I would place each of these heroes on his right\npedestal—that of Robespierre on his scaffold in the Place Louis Quinze;\nthat of Napoleon on the column of the Place Vendôme. The only\ndifference consists in the opposite character of the equality advocated\nby these two men; one is the equality that elevates, the other is the\nequality that degrades; one brings a king within reach of the\nguillotine, the other elevates the people to a level with the throne.\nObserve,” said Villefort, smiling, “I do not mean to deny that both\nthese men were revolutionary scoundrels, and that the 9th Thermidor and\nthe 4th of April, in the year 1814, were lucky days for France, worthy\nof being gratefully remembered by every friend to monarchy and civil\norder; and that explains how it comes to pass that, fallen, as I trust\nhe is forever, Napoleon has still retained a train of parasitical\nsatellites. Still, marquise, it has been so with other\nusurpers—Cromwell, for instance, who was not half so bad as Napoleon,\nhad his partisans and advocates.”\n\n“Do you know, Villefort, that you are talking in a most dreadfully\nrevolutionary strain? But I excuse it, it is impossible to expect the\nson of a Girondin to be free from a small spice of the old leaven.” A\ndeep crimson suffused the countenance of Villefort.\n\n“’Tis true, madame,” answered he, “that my father was a Girondin, but\nhe was not among the number of those who voted for the king’s death; he\nwas an equal sufferer with yourself during the Reign of Terror, and had\nwell-nigh lost his head on the same scaffold on which your father\nperished.”\n\n“True,” replied the marquise, without wincing in the slightest degree\nat the tragic remembrance thus called up; “but bear in mind, if you\nplease, that our respective parents underwent persecution and\nproscription from diametrically opposite principles; in proof of which\nI may remark, that while my family remained among the staunchest\nadherents of the exiled princes, your father lost no time in joining\nthe new government; and that while the Citizen Noirtier was a Girondin,\nthe Count Noirtier became a senator.”\n\n“Dear mother,” interposed Renée, “you know very well it was agreed that\nall these"}]}

D’Avrigny\nfollowed the direction and saw that they were fixed on a bottle\ncontaining the mixture which he took every morning. “Ah, indeed?” said\nd’Avrigny, struck with a sudden thought, “has it occurred to\nyou”—Noirtier did not let him finish.\n\n“Yes,” said he.\n\n“To prepare her system to resist poison?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“By accustoming her by degrees——”\n\n“Yes, yes, yes,” said Noirtier, delighted to be understood.\n\n“Of course.

Villefort,\ntherefore, gained nothing save the king’s gratitude (which was rather\nlikely to injure him at the present time) and the cross of the Legion\nof Honor, which he had the prudence not to wear, although M. de Blacas\nhad duly forwarded the brevet.\n\nNapoleon would, doubtless, have deprived Villefort of his office had it\nnot been for Noirtier, who was all powerful at court, and thus the\nGirondin of ’93 and the Senator of 1806 protected him who so lately had\nbeen his protector. All Villefort’s influence barely enabled him to\nstifle the secret Dantès had so nearly divulged. The king’s procureur\nalone was deprived of his office, being suspected of royalism.\n\nHowever, scarcely was the imperial power established—that is, scarcely\nhad the emperor re-entered the Tuileries and begun to issue orders from\nthe closet into which we have introduced our readers,—he found on the\ntable there Louis XVIII.’s half-filled snuff-box,—scarcely had this\noccurred when Marseilles began, in spite of the authorities, to\nrekindle the flames of civil war, always smouldering in the south, and\nit required but little to excite the populace to acts of far greater\nviolence than the shouts and insults with which they assailed the\nroyalists whenever they ventured abroad.\n\n0159m\n\n\n\nOwing to this change, the worthy shipowner became at that moment—we\nwill not say all powerful, because Morrel was a prudent and rather a\ntimid man, so much so, that many of the most zealous partisans of\nBonaparte accused him of “moderation”—but sufficiently influential to\nmake a demand in favor of Dantès.\n\nVillefort retained his place, but his marriage was put off until a more\nfavorable opportunity. If the emperor remained on the throne, Gérard\nrequired a different alliance to aid his career; if Louis XVIII.\nreturned, the influence of M. de Saint-Méran, like his own, could be\nvastly increased, and the marriage be still more suitable. The deputy\nprocureur was, therefore, the first magistrate of Marseilles, when one\nmorning his door opened, and M. Morrel was announced.\n\nAnyone else would have hastened to receive him; but Villefort was a man\nof ability, and he knew this would be a sign of weakness. He made\nMorrel wait in the antechamber, although he had no one with him, for\nthe simple reason that the king’s procureur always makes everyone wait,\nand after passing a quarter of an hour in reading the papers, he\nordered M. Morrel to be admitted.\n\nMorrel expected Villefort would be dejected; he found him as he had\nfound him six weeks before, calm, firm, and full of that glacial\npoliteness, that most insurmountable barrier which separates the\nwell-bred from the vulgar man.\n\nHe had entered Villefort’s office expecting that the magistrate would\ntremble at the sight of him; on the contrary, he felt a cold shudder\nall over him when he saw Villefort sitting there with his elbow on his\ndesk, and his head leaning on his hand. He stopped at the door;\nVillefort gazed at him as if he had some difficulty in recognizing him;\nthen, after a brief interval, during which the honest shipowner turned\nhis hat in his hands,\n\n“M. Morrel, I believe?” said Villefort.\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“Come nearer,” said the magistrate, with a patronizing wave of the\nhand, “and tell me to what circumstance I owe the honor of this visit.”\n\n“Do you not guess, monsieur?” asked Morrel.\n\n“Not in the least; but if I can serve you in any way I shall be\ndelighted.”\n"}, {"chunk_id": 343, "text": "one of the greatest; in fact, a man who believed himself, like\nyou, one of the envoys, not of God, but of a supreme being; not of\nProvidence, but of fate. Well, sir, the rupture of a blood-vessel on\nthe lobe of the brain has destroyed all this, not in a day, not in an\nhour, but in a second. M. Noirtier, who, on the previous night, was the\nold Jacobin, the old senator, the old Carbonaro, laughing at the\nguillotine, the cannon, and the dagger—M. Noirtier, playing with\nrevolutions—M. Noirtier, for whom France was a vast chess-board, from\nwhich pawns, rooks, knights, and queens were to disappear, so that the\nking was checkmated—M. Noirtier, the redoubtable, was the next morning\n_poor M. Noirtier_, the helpless old man, at the tender mercies of the\nweakest creature in the household, that is, his grandchild, Valentine;\na dumb and frozen carcass, in fact, living painlessly on, that time may\nbe given for his frame to decompose without his consciousness of its\ndecay.”\n\n“Alas, sir,” said Monte Cristo “this spectacle is neither strange to my\neye nor my thought. I am something of a physician, and have, like my\nfellows, sought more than once for the soul in living and in dead\nmatter; yet, like Providence, it has remained invisible to my eyes,\nalthough present to my heart. A hundred writers since Socrates, Seneca,\nSt. Augustine, and Gall, have made, in verse and prose, the comparison\nyou have made, and yet I can well understand that a father’s sufferings\nmay effect great changes in the mind of a son. I will call on you, sir,\nsince you bid me contemplate, for the advantage of my pride, this\nterrible spectacle, which must have been so great a source of sorrow to\nyour family.”\n\n“It would have been so unquestionably, had not God given me so large a\ncompensation. In contrast with the old man, who is dragging his way to\nthe tomb, are two children just entering into life—Valentine, the\ndaughter by my first wife—Mademoiselle Renée de Saint-Méran—and Edward,\nthe boy whose life you have this day saved.”\n\n“And what is your deduction from this compensation, sir?” inquired\nMonte Cristo.\n\n“My deduction is,” replied Villefort, “that my father, led away by his\npassions, has committed some fault unknown to human justice, but marked\nby the justice of God. That God, desirous in his mercy to punish but\none person, has visited this justice on him alone.”\n\nMonte Cristo with a smile on his lips, uttered in the depths of his\nsoul a groan which would have made Villefort fly had he but heard it.\n\n“Adieu, sir,” said the magistrate, who had risen from his seat; “I\nleave you, bearing a remembrance of you—a remembrance of esteem, which\nI hope will not be disagreeable to you when you know me better; for I\nam not a man to bore my friends, as you will learn. Besides, you have\nmade an eternal friend of Madame de Villefort.”\n\nThe count bowed, and contented himself with seeing Villefort to the\ndoor of his cabinet, the procureur being escorted to his carriage by\ntwo footmen, who, on a signal from their master, followed him with\nevery mark of attention. When he had gone, Monte Cristo breathed a\nprofound sigh, and said:\n\n“Enough of this poison, let me now seek the antidote.”\n\nThen sounding his bell, he said to Ali, who entered:\n\n“I am going to madame’s chamber—have the carriage ready at one\no’clock.”\n\n\n\n Chapter 49. Haydée\n\nIt will be recollected that the new, or rather old, acquaintances of\nthe Count of Monte Cristo, residing in the Rue Meslay, were no other\nthan Maximilian, Julie, and Emmanuel.\n\nThe very anticipations of delight to be enjoyed in his forthcoming\nvisits—the bright, pure gleam of heavenly happiness it diffused over\nthe almost deadly warfare in which he had voluntarily engaged,\nillumined his whole countenance with a look of ineffable joy and\ncalmness, as, immediately after Villefort’s departure, his thoughts\nflew back to the cheering prospect before him, of tasting, at least, a\nbrief respite from the fierce and stormy passions of his mind.

Nonsense! Impossible!” said Château-Renaud; “only ten\ndays after the flight of her daughter, and three days from the\nbankruptcy of her husband?”\n\nDebray colored slightly, and followed with his eyes the direction of\nBeauchamp’s glance.\n\n“Come,” he said, “it is only a veiled lady, some foreign princess,\nperhaps the mother of Cavalcanti. But you were just speaking on a very\ninteresting topic, Beauchamp.”\n\n“I?”\n\n“Yes; you were telling us about the extraordinary death of Valentine.”\n\n“Ah, yes, so I was. But how is it that Madame de Villefort is not\nhere?”\n\n“Poor, dear woman,” said Debray, “she is no doubt occupied in\ndistilling balm for the hospitals, or in making cosmetics for herself\nor friends. Do you know she spends two or three thousand crowns a year\nin this amusement? But I wonder she is not here. I should have been\npleased to see her, for I like her very much.”\n\n“And I hate her,” said Château-Renaud.\n\n“Why?”\n\n“I do not know. Why do we love? Why do we hate? I detest her, from\nantipathy.”\n\n“Or, rather, by instinct.”\n\n“Perhaps so. But to return to what you were saying, Beauchamp.”\n\n“Well, do you know why they die so multitudinously at M. de\nVillefort’s?”\n\n“‘Multitudinously’ is good,” said Château-Renaud.\n\n“My good fellow, you’ll find the word in Saint-Simon.”\n\n“But the thing itself is at M. de Villefort’s; but let’s get back to\nthe subject.”\n\n“Talking of that,” said Debray, “Madame was making inquiries about that\nhouse, which for the last three months has been hung with black.”\n\n“Who is Madame?” asked Château-Renaud.\n\n“The minister’s wife, _pardieu!_”\n\n“Oh, your pardon! I never visit ministers; I leave that to the\nprinces.”\n\n“Really, you were only before sparkling, but now you are brilliant;\ntake compassion on us, or, like Jupiter, you will wither us up.”\n\n“I will not speak again,” said Château-Renaud; “pray have compassio"}]}

For instance, having tried every\nother remedy to restore movement and speech to M. Noirtier, I resolved\nto try one last means, and for three months I have been giving him\nbrucine; so that in the last dose I ordered for him there were six\ngrains. This quantity, which is perfectly safe to administer to the\nparalyzed frame of M. Noirtier, which has become gradually accustomed\nto it, would be sufficient to kill another person.”\n\n“My dear doctor, there is no communication between M.

Morrel\npaid the expenses of his funeral, and a few small debts the poor old\nman had contracted.\n\nThere was more than benevolence in this action; there was courage; the\nsouth was aflame, and to assist, even on his death-bed, the father of\nso dangerous a Bonapartist as Dantès, was stigmatized as a crime.\n\n\n\n Chapter 14. The Two Prisoners\n\nA year after Louis XVIII.’s restoration, a visit was made by the\ninspector-general of prisons. Dantès in his cell heard the noise of\npreparation,—sounds that at the depth where he lay would have been\ninaudible to any but the ear of a prisoner, who could hear the splash\nof the drop of water that every hour fell from the roof of his dungeon.\nHe guessed something uncommon was passing among the living; but he had\nso long ceased to have any intercourse with the world, that he looked\nupon himself as dead.\n\nThe inspector visited, one after another, the cells and dungeons of\nseveral of the prisoners, whose good behavior or stupidity recommended\nthem to the clemency of the government. He inquired how they were fed,\nand if they had any request to make. The universal response was, that\nthe fare was detestable, and that they wanted to be set free.\n\nThe inspector asked if they had anything else to ask for. They shook\ntheir heads. What could they desire beyond their liberty? The inspector\nturned smilingly to the governor.\n\n“I do not know what reason government can assign for these useless\nvisits; when you see one prisoner, you see all,—always the same\nthing,—ill fed and innocent. Are there any others?”\n\n“Yes; the dangerous and mad prisoners are in the dungeons.”\n\n“Let us visit them,” said the inspector with an air of fatigue. “We\nmust play the farce to the end. Let us see the dungeons.”\n\n“Let us first send for two soldiers,” said the governor. “The prisoners\nsometimes, through mere uneasiness of life, and in order to be\nsentenced to death, commit acts of useless violence, and you might fall\na victim.”\n\n“Take all needful precautions,” replied the inspector.\n\nTwo soldiers were accordingly sent for, and the inspector descended a\nstairway, so foul, so humid, so dark, as to be loathsome to sight,\nsmell, and respiration.\n\n“Oh,” cried the inspector, “who can live here?”\n\n“A most dangerous conspirator, a man we are ordered to keep the most\nstrict watch over, as he is daring and resolute.”\n\n“He is alone?”\n\n“Certainly.”\n\n“How long has he been there?”\n\n“Nearly a year.”\n\n“Was he placed here when he first arrived?”\n\n“No; not until he attempted to kill the turnkey, who took his food to\nhim.”\n\n“To kill the turnkey?”\n\n“Yes, the very one who is lighting us. Is it not true, Antoine?” asked\nthe governor.\n\n“True enough; he wanted to kill me!” returned the turnkey.\n\n“He must be mad,” said the inspector.\n\n“He is worse than that,—he is a devil!” returned the turnkey.\n\n“Shall I complain of him?” demanded the inspector.\n\n“Oh, no; it is useless. Besides, he is almost mad now, and in another\nyear he will be quite so.”\n\n“So much the better for him,—he will suffer less,” said the inspector.\nHe was, as this remark shows, a man full of philanthropy, and in every\nway fit for his office.\n\n“You are right, sir,” replied the governor; “and this remark proves\nthat you have deeply considered the subject. Now we have in a dungeon\nabout twenty feet distant, and to which you descend by another stair,\nan old abbé, formerly leader of a party in Italy, who has been here\nsince 1811, and in 1813 he went mad, and the change is astonishing. He\nused to weep, he now laughs; he grew thin, he now grows fat. You had\nbetter see him, for his madness is amusing.”\n\n“I will see them both,” returned the inspector; “I must conscientiously\nperform my duty.”\n\nThis was the inspector’s first visit; he wished to display his\nauthority.\n\n“Let us visit this one first,” added he.\n\n“By all means,” replied the governor, and he signed to the turnkey to\nopen the door.

In the meanwhile, as the thing is difficult to find in\nFrance, and your abbé is not probably disposed to make a journey to\nParis on my account, I must continue to use Monsieur Planche’s\nanti-spasmodics; and mint and Hoffman’s drops are among my favorite\nremedies. Here are some lozenges which I have made up on purpose; they\nare compounded doubly strong.”\n\nMonte Cristo opened the tortoise-shell box, which the lady presented to\nhim, and inhaled the odor of the lozenges with the air of an amateur\nwho thoroughly appreciated their composition.\n\n“They are indeed exquisite,” he said; “but as they are necessarily\nsubmitted to the process of deglutition—a function which it is\nfrequently impossible for a fainting person to accomplish—I prefer my\nown specific.”\n\n“Undoubtedly, and so should I prefer it, after the effects I have seen\nproduced; but of course it is a secret, and I am not so indiscreet as\nto ask it of you.”\n\n“But I,” said Monte Cristo, rising as he spoke—“I am gallant enough to\noffer it you.”\n\n30079m\n\n\n\n“How kind you are.”\n\n“Only remember one thing—a small dose is a remedy, a large one is\npoison. One drop will restore life, as you have seen; five or six will\ninevitably kill, and in a way the more terrible inasmuch as, poured\ninto a glass of wine, it would not in the slightest degree affect its\nflavor. But I say no more, madame; it is really as if I were\nprescribing for you.”\n\nThe clock struck half-past six, and a lady was announced, a friend of\nMadame de Villefort, who came to dine with her.\n\n“If I had had the honor of seeing you for the third or fourth time,\ncount, instead of only for the second,” said Madame de Villefort; “if I\nhad had the honor of being your friend, instead of only having the\nhappiness of being under an obligation to you, I should insist on\ndetaining you to dinner, and not allow myself to be daunted by a first\nrefusal.”\n\n“A thousand thanks, madame,” replied Monte Cristo “but I have an\nengagement which I cannot break. I have promised to escort to the\nAcadémie a Greek princess of my acquaintance who has never seen your\ngrand opera, and who relies on me to conduct her thither.”\n\n“Adieu, then, sir, and do not forget the prescription.”\n\n“Ah, in truth, madame, to do that I must forget the hour’s conversation\nI have had with you, which is indeed impossible.”\n\nMonte Cristo bowed, and left the house. Madame de Villefort remained\nimmersed in thought.\n\n“He is a very strange man,” she said, “and in my opinion is himself the\nAdelmonte he talks about.”\n\nAs to Monte Cristo the result had surpassed his utmost expectations.\n\n“Good,” said he, as he went away; “this is a fruitful soil, and I feel\ncertain that the seed sown will not be cast on barren ground.”\n\nNext morning, faithful to his promise, he sent the prescription\nrequested.\n\n\n\n Chapter 53.

The first thing\nnecessary to render an act valid is, that the notary should be\nthoroughly convinced that he has faithfully interpreted the will and\nwishes of the person dictating the act.

An imperceptible smile of triumph\nwas expressed on the lips of the procureur.

Noirtier has received, without any detriment\nto his mental faculties?”\n\n“It is not exactly that, sir,” said the notary, “which makes me uneasy,\nbut the difficulty will be in wording his thoughts and intentions, so\nas to be able to get his answers.”\n\n“You must see that to be an utter impossibility,” said Villefort.\nValentine and the old man heard this conversation, and Noirtier fixed\nhis eye so earnestly on Valentine that she felt bound to answer to the\nlook.\n\n“Sir,” said she, “that need not make you uneasy, however difficult it\nmay at first sight appear to be.

He has but one\nfault, he is somewhat wilful; but really, on referring for the moment\nto what he said, do you truly believe that Mithridates used these\nprecautions, and that these precautions were efficacious?”\n\n“I think so, madame, because I myself have made use of them, that I\nmight not be poisoned at Naples, at Palermo, and at Smyrna—that is to\nsay, on three several occasions when, but for these precautions, I must\nhave lost my life.”\n\n“And your precautions were successful?”\n\n“Completely so.”\n\n“Yes, I remember now your mentioning to me at Perugia something of this\nsort.”\n\n“Indeed?” said the count with an air of surprise, remarkably well\ncounterfeited; “I really did not remember.”\n\n“I inquired of you if poisons acted equally, and with the same effect,\non men of the North as on men of the South; and you answered me that\nthe cold and sluggish habits of the North did not present the same\naptitude as the rich and energetic temperaments of the natives of the\nSouth.”\n\n“And that is the case,” observed Monte Cristo. “I have seen Russians\ndevour, without being visibly inconvenienced, vegetable substances\nwhich would infallibly have killed a Neapolitan or an Arab.”\n\n“And you really believe the result would be still more sure with us\nthan in the East, and in the midst of our fogs and rains a man would\nhabituate himself more easily than in a warm latitude to this\nprogressive absorption of poison?”\n\n“Certainly; it being at the same time perfectly understood that he\nshould have been duly fortified against the poison to which he had not\nbeen accustomed.”\n\n“Yes, I understand that; and how would you habituate yourself, for\ninstance, or rather, how did you habituate yourself to it?”\n\n“Oh, very easily. Suppose you knew beforehand the poison that would be\nmade use of against you; suppose the poison was, for instance,\nbrucine——”\n\n“Brucine is extracted from the false angostura8 is it not?” inquired\nMadame de Villefort.\n\n“Precisely, madame,” replied Monte Cristo; “but I perceive I have not\nmuch to teach you. Allow me to compliment you on your knowledge; such\nlearning is very rare among ladies.”\n\n“Oh, I am aware of that,” said Madame de Villefort; “but I have a\npassion for the occult sciences, which speak to the imagination like\npoetry, and are reducible to figures, like an algebraic equation; but\ngo on, I beg of you; what you say interests me to the greatest degree.”\n\n30069m\n\n\n\n“Well,” replied Monte Cristo “suppose, then, that this poison was\nbrucine, and you were to take a milligramme the first day, two\nmilligrammes the second day, and so on. Well, at the end of ten days\nyou would have taken a centigramme, at the end of twenty days,\nincreasing another milligramme, you would have taken three hundred\ncentigrammes; that is to say, a dose which you would support without\ninconvenience, and which would be very dangerous for any other person\nwho had not taken the same precautions as yourself. Well, then, at the\nend of a month, when drinking water from the same carafe, you would\nkill the person who drank with you, without your perceiving, otherwise\nthan from slight inconvenience, that there was any poisonous substance\nmingled with this water.”\n\n“Do you know any other counter-poisons?”\n\n“I do not.”\n\n“I have often read, and read again, the history of Mithridates,” said\nMadame de Villefort in a tone of reflection, “and had always considered\nit a fable.”\n\n“No, madame, contrary to most history, it is true; but what you tell\nme, madame, what you inquire of me, is not the result of a chance\nquery, for two years ago you asked me the same questions, and said\nthen, that for a very long time this history of Mithridates had\noccupied your mind.”\n\n“True, sir.

Then, having renewed his\ninjunction not to give Valentine anything, he went down again to\nNoirtier, shut the doors carefully, and after convincing himself that\nno one was listening:\n\n“Do you,” said he, “know anything of this young lady’s illness?”\n\n“Yes,” said the old man.\n\n“We have no time to lose; I will question, and do you answer me.”\nNoirtier made a sign that he was ready to answer. “Did you anticipate\nthe accident which has happened to your granddaughter?”\n\n“Yes.” D’Avrigny reflected a moment; then approaching Noirtier:\n\n“Pardon what I am going to say,” added he, “but no indication should be\nneglected in this terrible situation. Did you see poor Barrois die?”\nNoirtier raised his eyes to heaven.\n\n“Do you know of what he died!” asked d’Avrigny, placing his hand on\nNoirtier’s shoulder.\n\n“Yes,” replied the old man.\n\n“Do you think he died a natural death?” A sort of smile was discernible\non the motionless lips of Noirtier.\n\n“Then you have thought that Barrois was poisoned?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Do you think the poison he fell a victim to was intended for him?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Do you think the same hand which unintentionally struck Barrois has\nnow attacked Valentine?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Then will she die too?” asked d’Avrigny, fixing his penetrating gaze\non Noirtier. He watched the effect of this question on the old man.\n\n“No,” replied he with an air of triumph which would have puzzled the\nmost clever diviner.\n\n“Then you hope?” said d’Avrigny, with surprise.\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“What do you hope?” The old man made him understand with his eyes that\nhe could not answer.\n\n“Ah, yes, it is true,” murmured d’Avrigny. Then, turning to\nNoirtier,—“Do you hope the assassin will be tried?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Then you hope the poison will take no effect on Valentine?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“It is no news to you,” added d’Avrigny, “to tell you that an attempt\nhas been made to poison her?” The old man made a sign that he\nentertained no doubt upon the subject. “Then how do you hope Valentine\nwill escape?”\n\nNoirtier kept his eyes steadfastly fixed on the same spot. D’Avrigny\nfollowed the direction and saw that they were fixed on a bottle\ncontaining the mixture which he took every morning. “Ah, indeed?” said\nd’Avrigny, struck with a sudden thought, “has it occurred to\nyou”—Noirtier did not let him finish.\n\n“Yes,” said he.\n\n“To prepare her system to resist poison?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“By accustoming her by degrees——”\n\n“Yes, yes, yes,” said Noirtier, delighted to be understood.\n\n“Of course. I had told you that there was brucine in the mixture I give\nyou.”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“And by accustoming her to that poison, you have endeavored to\nneutralize the effect of a similar poison?” Noirtier’s joy continued.\n“And you have succeeded,” exclaimed d’Avrigny. “Without that precaution\nValentine would have died before assistance could have been procured.\nThe dose has been excessive, but she has only been shaken by it; and\nthis time, at any rate, Valentine will not die.”\n\nA superhuman joy expanded the old man’s eyes, which were raised towards\nheaven with an expression of infinite gratitude. At this moment\nVillefort returned.\n\n“Here, doctor,” said he, “is what you sent me for.”\n\n“Was this prepared in your presence?”\n\n“Yes,” replied the procureur.\n\n“Have you not let it go out of your hands?”\n\n“No.”\n\nD’Avrigny took the bottle, poured some drops of the mixture it\ncontained in the hollow of his hand, and swallowed them.\n\n“Well,” said he, “let us go to Valentine; I will give instructions to\neveryone, and you, M. de Villefort, will yourself see that no one\ndeviates from them.”\n\n40294m\n\n\n\nAt the moment when d’Avrigny was returning to Valentine’s room,\naccompanied by Villefort, an Italian priest, of serious demeanor and\ncalm an"}, {"chunk_id": 563, "text": "k could not find the right key.

Meanwhile Monte Cristo had rapidly taken off his greatcoat,\nwaistcoat, and shirt, and one might distinguish by the glimmering\nthrough the open panel that he wore a pliant tunic of steel mail, of\nwhich the last in France, where daggers are no longer dreaded, was worn\nby King Louis XVI., who feared the dagger at his breast, and whose head\nwas cleft with a hatchet. The tunic soon disappeared under a long\ncassock, as did his hair under a priest’s wig; the three-cornered hat\nover this effectually transformed the count into an abbé.\n\nThe man, hearing nothing more, stood erect, and while Monte Cristo was\ncompleting his disguise had advanced straight to the secretaire, whose\nlock was beginning to crack under his nightingale.\n\n“Try again,” whispered the count, who depended on the secret spring,\nwhich was unknown to the picklock, clever as he might be—“try again,\nyou have a few minutes’ work there.”\n\nAnd he advanced to the window. The man whom he had seen seated on a\nfence had got down, and was still pacing the street; but, strange as it\nappeared, he cared not for those who might pass from the avenue of the\nChamps-Élysées or by the Faubourg Saint-Honoré; his attention was\nengrossed with what was passing at the count’s, and his only aim\nappeared to be to discern every movement in the dressing-room.\n\nMonte Cristo suddenly struck his finger on his forehead and a smile\npassed over his lips; then drawing near to Ali, he whispered:\n\n“Remain here, concealed in the dark, and whatever noise you hear,\nwhatever passes, only come in or show yourself if I call you.”\n\nAli bowed in token of strict obedience. Monte Cristo then drew a\nlighted taper from a closet, and when the thief was deeply engaged with\nhis lock, silently opened the door, taking care that the light should\nshine directly on his face. The door opened so quietly that the thief\nheard no sound; but, to his astonishment, the room was suddenly\nilluminated. He turned.\n\n“Ah, good-evening, my dear M. Caderousse,” said Monte Cristo; “what are\nyou doing here, at such an hour?”\n\n40156m\n\n\n\n“The Abbé Busoni!” exclaimed Caderousse; and, not knowing how this\nstrange apparition could have entered when he had bolted the doors, he\nlet fall his bunch of keys, and remained motionless and stupefied. The\ncount placed himself between Caderousse and the window, thus cutting\noff from the thief his only chance of retreat.\n\n“The Abbé Busoni!” repeated Caderousse, fixing his haggard gaze on the\ncount.\n\n“Yes, undoubtedly, the Abbé Busoni himself,” replied Monte Cristo. “And\nI am very glad you recognize me, dear M. Caderousse; it proves you have\na good memory, for it must be about ten years since we last met.”\n\nThis calmness of Busoni, combined with his irony and boldness,\nstaggered Caderousse.\n\n“The abbé, the abbé!” murmured he, clenching his fists, and his teeth\nchattering.\n\n“So you would rob the Count of Monte Cristo?” continued the false abbé.\n\n“Reverend sir,” murmured Caderousse, seeking to regain the window,\nwhich the count pitilessly blocked—“reverend sir, I don’t know—believe\nme—I take my oath——”\n\n“A pane of glass out,” continued the count, “a dark lantern, a bunch of\nfalse keys, a secretaire half forced—it is tolerably evident——”\n\nCaderousse was choking; he looked "}, {"chunk_id": 473, "text": "\ntalent are they celebrated?

The thing was discussed for a long time, but finally decided\nin his favor. I can assure you the vertebra made a great noise in the\nlearned world, and the gentleman, who was only a knight of the Legion\nof Honor, was made an officer.”\n\n“Come,” said Monte Cristo, “this cross seems to me to be wisely\nawarded. I suppose, had he found another additional vertebra, they\nwould have made him a commander.”\n\n“Very likely,” said Albert.\n\n“And who can that person be who has taken it into his head to wrap\nhimself up in a blue coat embroidered with green?”\n\n“Oh, that coat is not his own idea; it is the Republic’s, which deputed\nDavid12 to devise a uniform for the Academicians.”\n\n“Indeed?” said Monte Cristo; “so this gentleman is an Academician?”\n\n“Within the last week he has been made one of the learned assembly.”\n\n“And what is his especial talent?”\n\n“His talent? I believe he thrusts pins through the heads of rabbits, he\nmakes fowls eat madder, and punches the spinal marrow out of dogs with\nwhalebone.”\n\n“And he is made a member of the Academy of Sciences for this?”\n\n“No; of the French Academy.”\n\n“But what has the French Academy to do with all this?”\n\n“I was going to tell you. It seems——”\n\n“That his experiments have very considerably advanced the cause of\nscience, doubtless?”\n\n“No; that his style of writing is very good.”\n\n“This must be very flattering to the feelings of the rabbits into whose\nheads he has thrust pins, to the fowls whose bones he has dyed red, and\nto the dogs whose spinal marrow he has punched out?”\n\nAlbert laughed.\n\n“And the other one?” demanded the count.\n\n“That one?”\n\n“Yes, the third.”\n\n“The one in the dark blue coat?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“He is a colleague of the count, and one of the most active opponents\nto the idea of providing the Chamber of Peers with a uniform. He was\nvery successful upon that question. He stood badly with the Liberal\npapers, but his noble opposition to the wishes of the court is now\ngetting him into favor with the journalists. They talk of making him an\nambassador.”\n\n30303m\n\n\n\n“And what are his claims to the peerage?”\n\n“He has composed two or three comic operas, written four or five\narticles in the _Siècle_, and voted five or six years on the\nministerial side.”\n\n“Bravo, viscount,” said Monte Cristo, smiling; “you are a delightful\n_cicerone_. And now you will do me a favor, will you not?”\n\n“What is it?”\n\n“Do not introduce me to any of these gentlemen; and should they wish\nit, you will warn me.” Just then the count felt his arm pressed. He\nturned round; it was Danglars.\n\n“Ah! is it you, baron?” said he.\n\n“Why do you call me baron?” said Danglars; “you know that I care\nnothing for my title. I am not like you, viscount; you like your title,\ndo you not?”\n\n“Certainly,” replied Albert, “seeing that without my title I should be\nnothing; while you, sacrificing the baron, would still remain the\nmillionaire.”\n\n“Which seems to me the finest title under the royalty of July,” replied\nDanglars.\n\n“Unfortunately,” said Monte Cristo, “one’s title to a millionaire does\nnot last for life, like that of baron, peer of France, or academician;\nfor example, the millionaires Franck & Poulmann, of Frankfurt, who have\njust become bankrupts.”\n\n“Indeed?” said Danglars, becoming pale.\n\n“Yes; I received the news this evening by a courier. I had about a\nmillion in their hands, but, warned in time, I withdrew it a month\nago.”\n\n“Ah, _mon Dieu!_” exclaimed Danglars, “they have drawn on me for\n200,000 francs!”\n\n“Well, you can throw out the draft; their signature is worth five per\ncent.”\n\n“Yes, but it is too late,” said Danglars, “I have honored their bills.”\n\n“Then,” said Monte Cristo, “here are 200,000 francs gone after——”\n\n“Hush, do not mention these things,” said Da"}, {"chunk_id": 343, "text": "one of the greatest; in fact, a man who believed himself, like\nyou, one of the envoys, not of God, but of a supreme being; not of\nProvidence, but of fate.

That God, desirous in his mercy to punish but\none person, has visited this justice on him alone.”\n\nMonte Cristo with a smile on his lips, uttered in the depths of his\nsoul a groan which would have made Villefort fly had he but heard it.\n\n“Adieu, sir,” said the magistrate, who had risen from his seat; “I\nleave you, bearing a remembrance of you—a remembrance of esteem, which\nI hope will not be disagreeable to you when you know me better; for I\nam not a man to bore my friends, as you will learn.

When he had gone, Monte Cristo breathed a\nprofound sigh, and said:\n\n“Enough of this poison, let me now seek the antidote.”\n\nThen sounding his bell, he said to Ali, who entered:\n\n“I am going to madame’s chamber—have the carriage ready at one\no’clock.”\n\n\n\n Chapter 49.

Ayrton was\nbrought on deck, and found himself in the presence of Harry Grant.\n\n\"It is I, Ayrton,\" said he.\n\n\"Yes, captain,\" replied Ayrton, without betraying any astonishment at\nHarry Grant's appearance. \"Well, I am not sorry to see you again in\ngood health.\"\n\n[Illustration: The passengers could see the quartermaster, with folded\narms, standing motionless as a statue, on a rock, and gazing at the\nvessel.]\n\n\"It seems, Ayrton, that I made a mistake in landing you on an inhabited\ncoast.\"\n\n\"It seems so, captain.\"\n\n\"You will take my place on this desert island.

My life has but one\nobject, to which it is wholly devoted,--to search always for him who\nwould never have abandoned either of us. Dear Mary, how good our father\nwas!\"\n\n\"And so noble, so generous!\" added Mary. \"Do you know, Robert, that he\nwas already one of the glories of our country, and would have ranked\namong its great men if fate had not arrested his course?\"\n\n\"How well I know it!\" answered Robert.\n\nMary pressed her brother to her heart, and the child felt tears\ndropping upon his forehead.\n\n\"Mary! Mary!\" cried he, \"it is in vain for them to speak, or to keep\nsilent. I hope still, and shall always do so. A man like our father\ndoes not die till he has accomplished his purpose!\"\n\nMary Grant could not reply; sobs choked her utterance. A thousand\nemotions agitated her soul at the thought that new attempts would be\nmade to find her father, and that the young captain's devotion was\nboundless.\n\n\"Does Mr. John still hope?\" asked she.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Robert. \"He is a brother who will never forsake us. I\nshall be a sailor, shall I not, sister,--a sailor to seek my father\nwith him? Are you willing?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mary. \"But must we be separated?\"\n\n\"You will not be alone, Mary, I know. John has told me so. Lady Helena\nwill not permit you to leave her. You are a woman, and can and ought to\naccept her benefits. To refuse them would be ungrateful. But a man, as\nmy father has told me a hundred times, ought to make his own fortune.\"\n\n\"But what will become of our house at Dundee, so full of associations?\"\n\n\"We will keep it, my sister. All that has been well arranged by our\nfriend John and Lord Glenarvan, who will keep you at Malcolm Castle\nlike a daughter. He said so to John, who told me. You will be at home\nthere, and wait till John and I bring back our father. Ah, what a\njoyful day that will be!\" cried Robert, whose face was radiant with\nenthusiasm.\n\n\"My brother, my child!\" exclaimed Mary, \"how happy our father would be\nif he could hear you! How much you resemble him, dear Robert! When you\nare a man you will be quite like him!\"\n\n\"God grant it, Mary!\" said Robert, glowing with holy and filial pride.\n\n\"But how shall we pay our debt to Lord and Lady Glenarvan?\" continued\nMary.\n\n\"Oh, that will not be difficult,\" answered Robert, with his boyish\nimpulsiveness. \"We will tell them how much we love and respect them,\nand we will show it to them by our actions.\"\n\n\"That is all we can do!\" added the young girl, covering her brother's\nface with kisses; \"and all that they will like, too!\"\n\nThen, relapsing into reveries, the two children of the captain gazed\nsilently into the shadowy obscurity of the night. However, in fancy\nthey still conversed, questioned, and answered each other. The sea\nrocked the ship in silence, and the phosphorescent waters glistened in\nthe darkness.\n\nBut now a strange, a seemingly supernatural event took place. The\nbrother and sister, by one of those magnetic attractions that\nmysteriously draw the souls of friends together, experienced at the\nsame instant the same curious hallucination.\n\n[Sidenote: \"METHOUGHT, THE BILLOWS SPOKE!\"]\n\nFrom the midst of these alternately brightening and darkening waves,\nthey thought they heard a voice issue, whose depth of sadness stirred\nevery fibre of their hearts.\n\n\"Help! help!\" cried the voice.\n\n\"Mary,\" said Robert, \"did you hear?"}]}

Between the shores of South America and the\nlittle speck in the ocean known by the name of Tristan d'Acunha, there\nwas no probability of her meeting with any strange sail; and under some\ncircumstances, or in some company, the days might have been monotonous\nand the hours might have hung wearily. But so ardent was the desire\nfor success, and so accomplished, yet varied, were the characters of\nthose who composed the little assembly, that the voyage on the South\nAtlantic, though devoid of striking incident, was by no means wanting\nin interest. Much of the time was spent on deck, where the ladies'\ncabins were now located, Mary Grant especially training her hand, head,\nand heart in feeling, thought, and action. The geographer set to work\non a composition entitled \"Travels of a Geographer on the Argentine\nPampas;\" but many a blank page did he leave. Tho Scottish peer (when\ntired of examining for the thousandth time all that belonged to his\nyacht) could look at the books and documents which he had brought with\nhim, intending to peruse them carefully. And as to the major he was\nnever in company and never out of company; his cigar insured, nothing\nelse was wanted.\n\nEver and anon many miles of the ocean would be covered by masses of\nsea-weed; these different species of algæ would afford subject for\nresearch; specimens must be preserved, authorities must be consulted,\nand as one result at least all would become wiser. Then a discussion\nwould ensue on some geographical problem, and maps that were not\nattainable were of course appealed to by each disputant, though the\nsubject in question was often of very trivial moment. It was in the\nmidst of a debate of this kind, during the evening, that a sailor cried\nout,--\n\n\"Land ahead!\"\n\n\"In what direction?\" asked Paganel.\n\n\"To windward,\" replied the sailor.\n\nThe landsmen's eyes were strained, but to no purpose. The geographer's\ntelescope was brought into requisition, but with no avail. \"I do not\nsee the land,\" said its owner.\n\n\"Look into the clouds,\" said the captain.\n\n\"Ah!\" replied Paganel, struck with the idea, and shortly with the\nreality also; for there was the barren mountain-top of Tristan d'Acunha.\n\n\"Then,\" said he, \"if I remember aright, we are eighty miles from it. Is\nnot that the distance from which this mountain is visible?\"\n\n\"Exactly so,\" replied the captain.\n\nA few hours brought them much nearer to the group of high and steep\nrocks, and at sunrise they saw the conical peak of Tristan, seemingly\nseparated from all the rest of the rocky group, and reflecting the\nglory of the blue heavens and of the rising orb on the pla"}, {"chunk_id": 166, "text": "ding, he judged it advisable to visit the ship\nin question. Accordingly, he, with Glenarvan, the major, Paganel, and\nRobert, took a boat, and pulled out to where it was anchored.\n\nIt was a brig of two hundred and fifty tons, called the Macquarie,\nwhich traded between the different ports of Australia and New Zealand.\nThe captain, or rather the \"master,\" received his visitors very\ngruffly. They saw that they had to deal with an uneducated man, whose\nmanners were not different from those of the five sailors of his\ncrew. A coarse red face, big hands, a flat nose, a blinded eye, lips\nblackened by his pipe, and a specially brutish appearance, made Will\nHalley a very forbidding character. But they had no choice, and for a\nvoyage of a few days there was no need to be very particular.\n\n\"What do you want?\" asked Will Halley, as the strangers reached the\ndeck of his vessel.\n\n\"The captain,\" replied Mangles.\n\n[Sidenote: A BUSINESS INTERVIEW.]\n\n\"I am he,\" said Halley. \"What then?\"\n\n\"The Macquarie is loading for Auckland?\"\n\n\"Yes. What of it?\"\n\n\"What does she carry?\"\n\n\"Anything that is bought or sold.\"\n\n\"When does she sail?\"\n\n\"To-morrow, at the noon tide.\"\n\n\"Would she take passengers?\"\n\n\"That depends upon the passengers, and whether they would be satisfied\nwith the ship's mess.\"\n\n\"They would take their own provisions.\"\n\n\"Well, how many are there?\"\n\n\"Nine,--two of them ladies.\"\n\n\"I have no cabins.\"\n\n\"We will arrange a place for their exclusive use.\"\n\n\"What then?\"\n\n\"Do you accept?\" asked Captain Mangles, who was not embarrassed by this\ncurtness.\n\n\"I must see,\" replied the master of the Macquarie. He took a turn or\ntwo, striking the deck with his heavy, hobnailed boots; then, turning\nto Captain Mangles, said:\n\n\"What do you pay?\"\n\n\"What do you ask?\" was the reply.\n\n\"Fifty pounds.\"\n\nGlenarvan nodded assent.\n\n\"Very well! Fifty pounds.\"\n\n\"But the passage in cash!\" added Halley.\n\n\"In cash.\"\n\n\"Food separate?\"\n\n\"Separate.\"\n\n\"Agreed. Well?\" said Will Halley, holding out his hand.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"The advance-money.\"\n\n\"Here is half the fare,--twenty-five pounds,\" said Captain Mangles,\ncounting out the sum, which the master pocketed without saying \"thank\nyou.\"\n\n\"Be on board to-morrow,\" said he. \"Whether you are here or not, I shall\nweigh anchor.\"\n\n\"We will be here.\"\n\nThereupon Glenarvan, the major, Robert, Paganel, and Captain Mangles\nleft the vessel, without Will Halley's having so much as touched the\nbrim of his hat.\n\n\"What a stupid fellow!\" was their first remark.\n\n\"Well, I like him,\" replied Paganel. \"He is a real sea-wolf.\"\n\n\"A real bear!\" remarked the major.\n\n\"And I imagine,\" added Captain Mangles, \"that this bear has at some\ntime traded in human flesh.\"\n\n\"What matter,\" replied Glenarvan, \"so long as he commands the\nMacquarie, which goes to New Zealand? We shall see very little of him\non the voyage.\"\n\nLady Helena and Mary Grant were very much pleased to know that they\nwere to start the next day. Glenarvan observed, however, that the\nMacquarie could not equal the Duncan for comfort; but, after so many\nhardships, they were not likely to be overcome by trifles. Mr. Olbinett\nwas requested to take charge of the provisions. The poor man, since the\nloss of the Duncan, had often lamented the unhappy fate of his wife,\nwho had remained on board, and would be, consequently, the victim of\nthe convicts' brutality. However, he fulfilled his duties as steward\nwith his accustomed zeal, and their food might yet consist of dishes\nthat were never seen on the ship's table.\n\nIn the mean time the major discounted at a money-changer's some drafts\nthat Glenarvan had on the Union Bank of Melbourne. As for Paganel, he\nprocured an excellent map of New Zealand.\n\nMulready was now quite well. He scarcely felt his wound, which had so\nnearly proved fatal. A few hours at sea would complete his recovery.\n\n[Illustration: The landlord of Victoria Hotel furnished them with two\nhorses, and they set out.]\n\nWilson went on board first, charged with arranging the passengers'\nquarters.

He held in his hand the letter written\nby Paganel, and signed by Glenarvan.\n\n\"Read it, my lord,\" said the old sailor.\n\nGlenarvan took the letter, and read:\n\n\"Order for Tom Austin to put to sea, and bring the Duncan to the\neastern coast of New Zealand.\"\n\n\"New Zealand?\" cried Paganel, starting.\n\nHe snatched the letter from Glenarvan's hands, rubbed his eyes,\nadjusted his spectacles to his nose, and read in his turn.\n\n\"New Zealand!\" repeated he, in an indescribable tone, while the letter\nslipped from his fingers.\n\nJust then he felt a hand fall upon his shoulder. He turned, and found\nhimself face to face with the major.\n\n[Sidenote: PAGANEL IN THE WITNESS-BOX.]\n\n\"Well, my good Paganel,\" said MacNabb, in a grave tone, \"it is\nfortunate that you did not send the Duncan to Cochin-China.\"\n\nThis sally finished the poor geographer. A fit of laughter seized the\nwhole crew. Paganel, as if mad, ran to and fro, holding his head in his\nhands, and tearing his hair. However, when he had recovered from his\nfrenzy, there was still another unavoidable question to answer.\n\n\"Now, Paganel,\" said Glenarvan, \"be candid. I acknowledge that your\nabsent-mindedness has been providential. To be sure, without you the\nDuncan would have fallen into the hands of the convicts; without you we\nshould have been recaptured by the Maoris. But do tell me, what strange\nassociation of ideas, what unnatural aberration, induced you to write\nNew Zealand instead of Australia?\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Paganel. \"It was----\"\n\nBut at that moment his eyes fell upon Robert and Mary Grant, and he\nstopped short, finally replying:\n\n\"Never mind, my dear Glenarvan. I am a madman, a fool, an incorrigible\nbeing, and shall die a most famous blunderer!\"\n\nThe affair was no longer discussed. The mystery of the Duncan's\npresence there was solved; and the travelers, so miraculously saved,\nthought only of revisiting their comfortable cabins and partaking of a\ngood breakfast.\n\nHowever, leaving Lady Helena, Mary Grant, the major, Paganel, and\nRobert to enter the saloon, Glenarvan and Captain Mangles retained Tom\nAustin with them. They wished to question him further.\n\n\"Now, Tom,\" said Glenarvan, \"let me know: did not this order to sail\nfor the coast of New Zealand seem strange to you?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord,\" replied Austin. \"I was very much surprised; but, as I\nam not in the habit of discussing the orders I receive, I obeyed. Could\nI act otherwise? If any accident had happened from not following your\ninstructions, should I not have been to blame? Would you have done\ndifferently, captain?\"\n\n\"No, Tom,\" answered Captain Mangles.\n\n\"But what did you think?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"I thought, my lord, that, in the cause of Captain Grant, it was\nnecessary to go wherever you directed me; that by some combination of\ncircumstances another vessel would take you to New Zealand, and that\nI was to wait for you on the eastern coast of the island. Moreover,\non leaving Melbourne, I kept my destination secret, and the crew did\nnot know it till we were out at sea and the shores of Australia had\ndisappeared from sight. But then an incident occurred that perplexed me\nvery much.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, Tom?\" inquired Glenarvan.\n\n\"I mean,\" he replied, \"that when the quartermaster, Ayrton, learned,\nthe day after our departure, the Duncan's destination----\"\n\n\"Ayrton!\" cried Glenarvan. \"Is he on board?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord.\"\n\n\"Ayrton here!\" repeated Glenarvan, glancing at Captain Mangles.\n\n\"Wonderful indeed!\" said the young captain.\n\nIn an instant, with the swiftness of lightning, Ayrton's conduct, his\nlong-contrived treachery, Glenarvan's wound, the attack upon Mulready,\ntheir suffer"}, {"chunk_id": 0, "text": "*** START OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK 46597 ***\n\nNote: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this\n      file which includes the original 170 engravings.\n      See 46597-h.htm or 46597-h.zip:\n      (http://www.gutenberg.org/files/46597/46597-h/46597-h.htm)\n      or\n      (http://www.gutenberg.org/files/46597/46597-h.zip)\n\n\n      Images of the original pages are available through\n      HathiTrust Digital Library.

The flag of England fluttered at her yard-arm, while at\nthe top of the mainmast floated a blue pennon, bearing the initials\nE. G., worked in gold and surmounted by a ducal coronet. The yacht\nwas called the Duncan, and belonged to Lord Glenarvan, one of the\nsixteen Scottish peers sitting in the House of Lords, and also a most\ndistinguished member of the \"Royal Thames Yacht Club,\" so celebrated\nthroughout the United Kingdom.\n\nLord Edward Glenarvan was on board with his young wife, Lady Helena"}, {"chunk_id": 223, "text": "ths\nafter my abandonment, the finding of the document, the shipwreck of the\nvessel, and finally the important reasons you had for seeking Captain\nGrant in Australia. I did not hesitate, but resolved to appropriate\nthe Duncan,--a marvelous ship, that would have distanced the best of\nthe British navy. However, there were serious injuries to be repaired.\nI therefore let her start for Melbourne, and offered myself to you in\nmy real character of quartermaster, volunteering to guide you to the\nscene of the shipwreck, which I falsely located on the eastern coast\nof Australia. Thus followed at a distance and sometimes preceded by\nmy band of convicts, I conducted your party across the province of\nVictoria. My companions committed a useless crime at Camden Bridge,\nsince the Duncan, once at Twofold Bay, could not have escaped me, and\nwith it I should have been master of the ocean. I brought you thus\nunsuspectingly as far as the Snowy River. The horses and oxen fell dead\none by one, poisoned by the gastrolobium. I entangled the cart in the\nmarshes. At my suggestion----but you know the rest, my lord, and can\nbe certain that, except for Mr. Paganel's absent-mindedness, I should\nnow be commander on board the Duncan. Such is my story, gentlemen. My\ndisclosures, unfortunately, cannot set you on the track of Captain\nGrant, and you see that in dealing with me you have made a bad bargain.\"\n\nThe quartermaster ceased, crossed his arms, according to his custom,\nand waited. Glenarvan and his friends were silent. They felt that this\nstrange criminal had told the entire truth. The capture of the Duncan\nhad only failed through a cause altogether beyond his control. His\naccomplices had reached Twofold Bay, as the convict's blouse, found by\nGlenarvan, proved. There, faithful to the orders of their chief, they\nhad lain in wait for the yacht, and at last, tired of watching, they\nhad doubtless resumed their occupation of plunder and burning in the\nfields of New South Wales.\n\nThe major was the first to resume the examination, in order to\ndetermine the dates relative to the Britannia.\n\n\"It was the 8th of April, 1862, then, that you were landed on the west\ncoast of Australia?\" he asked of the quartermaster.\n\n\"Exactly,\" replied Ayrton.\n\n\"And do you know what Captain Grant's plans were then?\"\n\n\"Vaguely.\"\n\n\"Continue, Ayrton,\" said Glenarvan. \"The least sign may set us on the\ntrack.\"\n\n\"What I can say is this, my lord. Captain Grant intended to visit New\nZealand. But this part of his programme was not carried out while I was\non board. The Britannia might, therefore, after leaving Callao, have\ngained the shores of New Zealand. This would agree with the date, June\n27, 1862, given in the document as the time of the shipwreck.\"\n\n\"Evidently,\" remarked Paganel.\n\n\"But,\" added Glenarvan, \"there is nothing in these half-obliterated\nportions of the document which can apply to New Zealand.\"\n\n\"That I cannot answer,\" said the quartermaster.\n\n\"Well, Ayrton,\" continued Glenarvan, \"you have kept your word, and I\nwill keep mine. We will decide on what island of the Pacific you shall\nbe abandoned.\"\n\n\"Oh, it matters little to me,\" answered Ayrton.\n\n\"Return to your cabin now, and await our decision.\"\n\nThe quartermaster retired, under guard of the two sailors.\n\n\"This villain might have been a great man,\" observed the major.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Glenarvan. \"He has a strong and self-reliant character.\nWhy must his abilities be devoted to crime?\"\n\n\"But Harry Grant?\"\n\n\"I fear that he is forever lost! Poor children! who could tell them\nwhere their father is?\"\n\n\"I!\" cried Paganel.\n\nAs we have remarked, the geographer, although so loquacious and\nexcitable usually, had scarcely spoken during Ayrton's examination. He\nhad listened in total silence. But this last word that he had uttered\nwas worth more than all the others, and startled Glenarvan at once.\n\n\"You, Paganel!\" he exclaimed; \"do you know where Captain Grant is?\"\n\n\"As well as can be known,\" answered the geographer.\n\n\"And how do you know?\"\n\n\"By"}]}

His strength must have been\nunusual, even considering his stature, for he was all bone and sinew.\nHis countenance, full of intelligence and energy, although the features\nwere stern, prepossessed one in his favor. The sympathy that he\nelicited was still more increased by the traces of recent hardships\nimprinted upon his face. It was evident that he had suffered much,\nalthough he seemed a man able to brave, endure, and conquer suffering.\n\nThe travelers felt all this at first sight. Ayrton's appearance had\ninterested them; and Glenarvan, acting as spokesman for all, pressed\nhim with inquiries. This strange meeting had evidently produced a\nbewildering effect, and the first questions were, to some extent,\nwithout order.\n\n\"You are one of the sailors of the Britannia?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"Yes, my lord; Captain Grant's quartermaster,\" replied Ayrton.\n\n\"Saved with him from the shipwreck?\"\n\n\"No, my lord. At that terrible moment I was washed overboard and cast\nashore.\"\n\n\"You are not one of the sailors, then, of whom the document makes\nmention?\"\n\n\"No; I did not know of the existence of such a document. The captain\nmust have thrown it overboard after I was gone.\"\n\n\"But the captain, the captain?\"\n\n\"I suppose he was lost, drowned, with the rest of the crew. I thought I\nwas the sole survivor.\"\n\n\"But you said that Captain Grant was living!\"\n\n[Illustration: He was a somewhat rough-looking, broad-shouldered man,\nof about forty-five.]\n\n[Illustration: \"When I was washed from the forecastle, as I was hauling\ndown the jib, the Britannia was driving towards the coast of Australia,\nwhich was not two cable-lengths distant.\"]\n\n\"No. I said, 'if the captain is living'----\"\n\n\"'He is in Australia,' you added.\"\n\n\"He can be nowhere else.\"\n\n\"You do not know, then, where he is?\"\n\n\"No, my lord. I repeat that I thought he was buried in the waves or\ndashed upon the rocks. You say that perhaps he is still living.\"\n\n\"What do you know, then?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"Simply this, that if Captain Grant is living he is in Australia.\"\n\n\"Where did the shipwreck take place?\" inquired the major.\n\nThis should have been the first question; but, in the excitement of the\nmoment, Glenarvan, anxious to know where Captain Grant was, had not\ninquired where the Britannia was lost. From this point the conversation\nassumed a more definite form, and soon the details of the complicated\nstory appeared clear and exact to the minds of Ayrton's hearers.\n\nTo the major's question Ayrton replied,--\n\n\"When I was washed from the forecastle, as I was hauling down the jib,\nthe Britannia was driving towards the coast of Australia, which was not\ntwo cable-lengths distant. The shipwreck, therefore, took place at that\npoint.\"\n\n\"In latitude thirty-seven?\""}, {"chunk_id": 222, "text": "on, and\nstill I do not hesitate to tell you that I know little concerning Harry\nGrant.\"\n\n\"Little!\" cried Glenarvan.\n\n\"Yes, my lord; the circumstances that I am able to communicate to\nyou are relative to myself. They are personal experiences, and will\nscarcely tend to put you on the track you have lost.\"\n\n[Sidenote: REVELATIONS AND DISCLOSURES.]\n\nA keen disappointment was manifest on the features of Glenarvan and\nthe major. They had believed the quartermaster to possess an important\nsecret, and yet he now confessed that his disclosures would be almost\nuseless.\n\nHowever that may be, this avowal of Ayrton, who surrendered himself\nwithout security, singularly affected his hearers, especially when he\nadded, in conclusion:\n\n\"Thus you are forewarned, my lord, that the business will be less\nadvantageous for you than for me.\"\n\n\"No matter,\" replied Glenarvan; \"I accept your proposal, Ayrton. You\nhave my word that you shall be landed at one of the islands of the\nPacific.\"\n\n\"Very well, my lord,\" said he.\n\nWas this strange man pleased with this decision? You might have doubted\nit, for his impassive countenance betrayed no emotion. He seemed as if\nacting for another more than for himself.\n\n\"I am ready to answer,\" continued he.\n\n\"We have no questions to ask you,\" rejoined Glenarvan. \"Tell us what\nyou know, Ayrton, and, in the first place, who you are.\"\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" replied he, \"I am really Tom Ayrton, quartermaster of the\nBritannia. I left Glasgow in Captain Grant's ship on the 12th of March,\n1861. For fourteen months we traversed together the Pacific, seeking\nsome favorable place to found a Scottish colony. Harry Grant was a man\ncapable of performing great deeds, but frequently serious disputes\narose between us. His character did not harmonize with mine. I could\nnot yield; but with Harry Grant, when his resolution is taken, all\nresistance is impossible. He is like iron towards himself and others.\nHowever, I dared to mutiny, and attempted to involve the crew and gain\npossession of the vessel. Whether I did right or wrong is of little\nimportance. However it may be, Captain Grant did not hesitate to land\nme, April 8, 1862, on the west coast of Australia.\"\n\n\"Australia!\" exclaimed the major, interrupting Ayrton's story. \"Then\nyou left the Britannia before her arrival at Callao, where the last\nnews of her was dated?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the quartermaster; \"for the Britannia never stopped at\nCallao while I was on board. If I spoke of Callao at O'Moore's farm, it\nwas your story that gave me this information.\"\n\n\"Go on, Ayrton,\" said Glenarvan.\n\n[Sidenote: MORE BLANKS THAN PRIZES.]\n\n\"I found myself, therefore, abandoned on an almost desert coast, but\nonly twenty miles from the penitentiary of Perth, the capital of\nWestern Australia. Wandering along the shore, I met a band of convicts\nwho had just escaped. I joined them. You will spare me, my lord, the\naccount of my life for two years and a half. It is enough to know that\nI became chief of the runaways, under the name of Ben Joyce. In the\nmonth of September, 1864, I made my appearance at the Irishman's farm,\nand was received as a servant under my true name of Ayrton. Here I\nwaited till an opportunity should be offered to gain possession of a\nvessel. This was my great object. Two months later the Duncan arrived.\nDuring your visit at the farm you related, my lord, the whole story of\nCaptain Grant. I then learned what I had not known, the Britannia's\nstoppage at Callao, the last news of her, dated June, 1862, two months\nafter my abandonment, the finding of the document, the shipwreck of the\nvessel, and finally the important reasons you had for seeking Captain\nGrant in Australia. I did not hesitate, but resolved to appropriate\nthe Duncan,--a marvelous ship, that would have distanced the best of\nthe British navy.

Accordingly, he, with Glenarvan, the major, Paganel, and\nRobert, took a boat, and pulled out to where it was anchored.\n\nIt was a brig of two hundred and fifty tons, called the Macquarie,\nwhich traded between the different ports of Australia and New Zealand.\nThe captain, or rather the \"master,\" received his visitors very\ngruffly. They saw that they had to deal with an uneducated man, whose\nmanners were not different from those of the five sailors of his\ncrew. A coarse red face, big hands, a flat nose, a blinded eye, lips\nblackened by his pipe, and a specially brutish appearance, made Will\nHalley a very forbidding character. But they had no choice, and for a\nvoyage of a few days there was no need to be very particular.\n\n\"What do you want?\" asked Will Halley, as the strangers reached the\ndeck of his vessel.\n\n\"The captain,\" replied Mangles.\n\n[Sidenote: A BUSINESS INTERVIEW.]\n\n\"I am he,\" said Halley. \"What then?\"\n\n\"The Macquarie is loading for Auckland?\"\n\n\"Yes. What of it?\"\n\n\"What does she carry?\"\n\n\"Anything that is bought or sold.\"\n\n\"When does she sail?\"\n\n\"To-morrow, at the noon tide.\"\n\n\"Would she take passengers?\"\n\n\"That depends upon the passengers, and whether they would be satisfied\nwith the ship's mess.\"\n\n\"They would take their own provisions.\"\n\n\"Well, how many are there?\"\n\n\"Nine,--two of them ladies.\"\n\n\"I have no cabins.\"\n\n\"We will arrange a place for their exclusive use.\"\n\n\"What then?\"\n\n\"Do you accept?\" asked Captain Mangles, who was not embarrassed by this\ncurtness.\n\n\"I must see,\" replied the master of the Macquarie. He took a turn or\ntwo, striking the deck with his heavy, hobnailed boots; then, turning\nto Captain Mangles, said:\n\n\"What do you pay?\"\n\n\"What do you ask?\" was the reply.\n\n\"Fifty pounds.\"\n\nGlenarvan nodded assent.\n\n\"Very well! Fifty pounds.\"\n\n\"But the passage in cash!\" added Halley.\n\n\"In cash.\"\n\n\"Food separate?\"\n\n\"Separate.\"\n\n\"Agreed. Well?\" said Will Halley, holding out his hand.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"The advance-money.\"\n\n\"Here is half the fare,--twenty-five pounds,\" said Captain Mangles,\ncounting out the sum, which the master pocketed without saying \"thank\nyou.\"\n\n\"Be on board to-morrow,\" said he. \"Whether you are here or not, I shall\nweigh anchor.\"\n\n\"We will be here.\"\n\nThereupon Glenarvan, the major, Robert, Paganel, and Captain Mangles\nleft the vessel, without Will Halley's having so much as touched the\nbrim of his hat.\n\n\"What a stupid fellow!\" was their first remark.\n\n\"Well, I like him,\" replied Paganel. \"He is a real sea-wolf.\"\n\n\"A real bear!\" remarked the major.\n\n\"And I imagine,\" added Captain Mangles, \"that this bear has at some\ntime traded in human flesh.\"\n\n\"What matter,\" replied Glenarvan, \"so long as he commands the\nMacquarie, which goes to New Zealand? We shall see very little of him\non the voyage.\"\n\nLady Helena and Mary Grant were very much pleased to know that they\nwere to start the next day. Glenarvan observed, however, that the\nMacquarie could not equal the Duncan for comfort; but, after so many\nhardships, they were not likely to be overcome by trifles. Mr. Olbinett\nwas requested to take charge of the provisions. The poor man, since the\nloss of the Duncan, had often lamented the unhappy fate of his wife,\nwho had remained on board, and would be, consequently, the victim of\nthe convicts' brutality. However, he fulfilled his duties as steward\nwith his accustomed zeal, and their food might yet consist of dishes\nthat were never seen on the ship's table.\n\nIn the mean time the major discounted at a money-changer's some drafts\nthat Glenarvan had on the Union Bank of Melbourne. As for Paganel, he\nprocured an excellent map of New Zealand.\n\nMulready was now quite well. He scarcely felt his wound, which had so\nnearly proved fatal. A few hours at sea would complete his recovery.\n\n[Illustration: The landlord of Victoria Hotel furnished them with two\nhorses, and they set out.]\n\nWilson went on board first, charged with arranging the passengers'\nquarters.

While he was gone, they gazed\nat each other in silence, except the major, who, with his eye fixed\nupon Paganel, said, as he folded his arms:\n\n\"Indeed, I must confess, Paganel, that this is a little too much.\"\n\nAt this moment Austin returned. He held in his hand the letter written\nby Paganel, and signed by Glenarvan.\n\n\"Read it, my lord,\" said the old sailor.\n\nGlenarvan took the letter, and read:\n\n\"Order for Tom Austin to put to sea, and bring the Duncan to the\neastern coast of New Zealand.\"\n\n\"New Zealand?\" cried Paganel, starting.\n\nHe snatched the letter from Glenarvan's hands, rubbed his eyes,\nadjusted his spectacles to his nose, and read in his turn.\n\n\"New Zealand!\" repeated he, in an indescribable tone, while the letter\nslipped from his fingers.\n\nJust then he felt a hand fall upon his shoulder. He turned, and found\nhimself face to face with the major.\n\n[Sidenote: PAGANEL IN THE WITNESS-BOX.]\n\n\"Well, my good Paganel,\" said MacNabb, in a grave tone, \"it is\nfortunate that you did not send the Duncan to Cochin-China.\"\n\nThis sally finished the poor geographer. A fit of laughter seized the\nwhole crew. Paganel, as if mad, ran to and fro, holding his head in his\nhands, and tearing his hair. However, when he had recovered from his\nfrenzy, there was still another unavoidable question to answer.\n\n\"Now, Paganel,\" said Glenarvan, \"be candid. I acknowledge that your\nabsent-mindedness has been providential. To be sure, without you the\nDuncan would have fallen into the hands of the convicts; without you we\nshould have been recaptured by the Maoris. But do tell me, what strange\nassociation of ideas, what unnatural aberration, induced you to write\nNew Zealand instead of Australia?\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Paganel. \"It was----\"\n\nBut at that moment his eyes fell upon Robert and Mary Grant, and he\nstopped short, finally replying:\n\n\"Never mind, my dear Glenarvan. I am a madman, a fool, an incorrigible\nbeing, and shall die a most famous blunderer!\"\n\nThe affair was no longer discussed. The mystery of the Duncan's\npresence there was solved; and the travelers, so miraculously saved,\nthought only of revisiting their comfortable cabins and partaking of a\ngood breakfast.\n\nHowever, leaving Lady Helena, Mary Grant, the major, Paganel, and\nRobert to enter the saloon, Glenarvan and Captain Mangles retained Tom\nAustin with them. They wished to question him further.\n\n\"Now, Tom,\" said Glenarvan, \"let me know: did not this order to sail\nfor the coast of New Zealand seem strange to you?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord,\" replied Austin. \"I was very much surprised; but, as I\nam not in the habit of discussing the orders I receive, I obeyed. Could\nI act otherwise? If any accident had happened from not following your\ninstructions, should I not have been to blame? Would you have done\ndifferently, captain?\"\n\n\"No, Tom,\" answered Captain Mangles.\n\n\"But what did you think?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"I thought, my lord, that, in the cause of Captain Grant, it was\nnecessary to go wherever you directed me; that by some combination of\ncircumstances another vessel would take you to New Zealand, and that\nI was to wait for you on the eastern coast of the island. Moreover,\non leaving Melbourne, I kept my destination secret, and the crew did\nnot know it till we were out at sea and the shores of Australia had\ndisappeared from sight. But then an incident occurred that perplexed me\nvery much.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, Tom?\" inquired Glenarvan.\n\n\"I mean,\" he replied, \"that when the quartermaster, Ayrton, learned,\nthe day after our departure, the Duncan's destination----\"\n\n\"Ayrton!\" cried Glenarvan. \"Is he on board?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord.\"\n\n\"Ayrton here!\" repeated Glenarvan, glancing at Captain Mangles.\n\n\"Wonderful indeed!\" said the young captain.\n\nIn an instant, with the swiftness of lightning, Ayrton's conduct, his\nlong-contrived treachery, Glenarvan's wound, the attack upon Mulready,\ntheir suffer"}, {"chunk_id": 71, "text": "lighted! Welcome, welcome! I am almost a Frenchman,\"\ncried the commander, shaking the geographer's arm with rather painful\nviolence.\n\n\"One of your friends?\" asked the major of Paganel.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied he, with national pride; \"we have friends in all parts\nof the world!\"\n\n[Illustration: \"Ah, I am delighted! Welcome, welcome! I am almost a\nFrenchman,\" cried the commander, shaking the geographer's arm with\nrather painful violence.]\n\n[Sidenote: RAISING A REGIMENT.]\n\nHe then entered into conversation with the commander. Glenarvan would\ngladly have put in a word in regard to his affairs, but the soldier\nwas telling his story, and was not in the mood to be interrupted.\nThis honest man had left France a long time before; and the native\nlanguage was no longer perfectly familiar to him: he had forgotten,\nif not words, at least the manner of combining them. As his visitors\nsoon learned, he had been a sergeant in the French army. Since the\nfoundation of the fort he had not left it, and commanded it by\nappointment from the Argentine government. He was by parentage a\nBasque, and his name was Manuel Ipharaguerre. A year after his arrival\nin the country, Sergeant Manuel was naturalized, joined the Argentine\narmy, and married an honest Indian woman, who had twins,--boys, to be\nsure, for the sergeant's worthy consort would never present him with\ndaughters. Manuel did not think of any other calling than that of the\nsoldier, and hoped, in time, with the help of God, to offer to the\nrepublic a whole battalion of young soldiers.\n\n\"You have seen them?\" said he. \"Charming fellows! Good soldiers! José!\nJuan! Miguel! Pepe! Pepe is only seven years old, and is already biting\nhis cartridge!\"\n\nPepe, hearing himself complimented, joined his two little feet, and\npresented arms with perfect precision.\n\n\"He will do!\" added the sergeant. \"He will be a major--or\nbrigadier-general one day!\"\n\nThis story lasted a quarter of an hour, to Thalcave's great\nastonishment. The Indian could not understand how so many words could\ncome from a single throat. No one interrupted the commander; and even\na French sergeant had to conclude at last, though not without forcing\nhis guests to accompany him to his dwelling. Here they were introduced\nto Madame Ipharaguerre, who appeared to be \"a good-looking person,\" if\nthis expression may be employed in regard to an Indian.\n\nWhen he had exhausted himself, the sergeant asked his guests to what he\nowed the honor of their visit. And now it was their turn to explain.\n\nPaganel, opening the conversation in French, told him of their journey\nacross the Pampas, and ended by asking why the Indians had abandoned\nthe country.\n\n\"War!\" replied the sergeant.\n\n\"War?\"\n\n\"Yes, civil war.\"\n\n\"Civil war?\" rejoined Paganel.\n\n\"Yes, war between Paraguay and Buenos Ayres,\" answered the sergeant.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Why, all the Indians of the north are in the rear of General Flores,\nand those of the plains are plundering.\"\n\n\"But the caziques?\"\n\n\"The caziques with them.\"\n\nThis answer was reported to Thalcave, who shook his head. Indeed,\nhe either did not know, or had forgotten, that a civil war, which\nwas afterwards to involve Brazil, was decimating two-thirds of the\nrepublic. The Indians had everything to gain in these internal\nstruggles, and could not neglect such fine opportunities for plunder.\nThe sergeant, therefore, was not mistaken in attributing this desertion\nof the Pampas to the civil war that was being waged in the northern\npart of the Argentine Provinces.\n\nBut this event disconcerted Glenarvan's hopes. If Captain Grant was\na prisoner of the caziques, he must have been carried by them to the\nnorthern frontiers. Yet how and where to find him? Must they attempt\na perilous and almost useless search to the northern limits of the\nPampas? It was a serious matter, which was to be earnestly considered.\n\nHowever, one important question was still to be asked of the sergeant,\nand the major thought of this, while his companions were looking at\neach other in silence.\n\n\"Hav"}]}

Then, smiling, he went and gathered on the banks\nof the stream a few handfuls of wild celery, with which he rubbed the\nboy's body. Under this treatment, performed with an extreme gentleness,\nthe child felt his strength revive, and it was plain that a few hours\nwould suffice to restore him.\n\nIt was therefore decided that that day and the following night should\nbe passed at the encampment. Besides, two important questions remained\nto be settled--food, and means of conveyance. Provisions and mules were\nboth wanting.\n\nFortunately Thalcave solved the difficulty. This guide, who was\naccustomed to conduct travelers along the Patagonian frontiers, and\nwas one of the most intelligent baqueanos of the country, engaged to\nfurnish Glenarvan all that his little party needed. He offered to take\nhim to a \"tolderia\" (encampment) of Indians, about four miles distant,\nwhere they would find everything necessary for the expedition. This\nproposal was made partly by gestures, partly by Spanish words which\nPaganel succeeded in understanding. It was accepted, and Glenarvan and\nhis learned friend, taking leave of their companions, reascended the\nstream under the guidance of the Patagonian.\n\nThey proceeded at a good pace for an hour and a half, taking long\nstrides to keep up to the giant Thalcave. All the region was charming,\nand of a rich fertility. The grassy pastures succeeded each other,\nand could easily have fed thousands of cattle. Large ponds, united by\na winding chain of streams, gave these plains a verdant moisture.\nBlack-headed swans sported on the mirror-like surface, and disputed the\nempire of the waters with numberless ostriches that gamboled over the\nplains, while the brilliant feathered tribes were in wonderful variety.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nJacques Paganel proceeded from admiration to ecstasy. Exclamations\nof delight continually escaped his lips, to the astonishment of the\nPatagonian, who thought it very natural that there should be birds in\nthe air, swans on the lakes, and grass on the prairies. The geographer\nhad no reason to regret his walk, or complain of its length. He\nscarcely believed himself started, or that the encampment would soon\ncome in sight.\n\nThis tolderia was at the bottom of a narrow valley among the mountains.\nHere in huts of branches lived thirty wandering natives, grazing\nlarge herds of milch cows, sheep, cattle and horses. Thus they roamed\nfrom one pasture to another, always finding a repast ready for their\nfour-footed companions.\n\n[Sidenote: GLENARVAN GOING TO MARKET.]\n\nThalcave took upon himself the negotiation, which was not long. In\nreturn for seven small Argentine horses, all saddled, a hundred pounds\nof dried meat, a few measures of rice, and some leathern bottles for\nwater, the Indians received twenty ounces of gold, the value of which\nthey perfectly understood. Glenarvan would have bought another horse\nfor the Patagonian, but he intimated that it was unnecessary.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe bargain concluded, Glenarvan took leave of his new \"providers,\" as\nPaganel expressed it, and returned to the encampment. His arrival was\nwelcomed by cries of joy at sight of the provisions and horses. Every\none ate with avidity. Robert partook of some nourishment; he had almost\nentirely regained his strength, and the remainder of the day was passed\nin perfect rest. Various subjects were alluded to: the absent dear\nones, the Duncan, Captain Mangles, his brave crew, and Harry Grant who\nwas, perhaps, not far distant.\n\nAs for Paganel, he did not leave the Indian. He became Thalcave's\nshadow, and could not remain quiet in the presence of a real\nPatagonian, in comparison with whom he would have passed for a dwarf.\nHe overwhelmed the grave Indian with Spanish phrases, to which the\nlatter quietly listened. The geographer studied this time without a\nbook, and was often heard repeating words aloud.\n\n\"If I do not get the accent,\" said he to the major, \"you must not be\nangry with me. Who would have thought that one day a Pa"}, {"chunk_id": 36, "text": "xcepting\nRobert, were still in good health; and, since the journey had begun\nunder such favorable auspices, they thought it best to profit by it,\nand push on. The following day they advanced rapidly, crossed without\naccident Bell Rapids, and at evening encamped on the banks of the Rio\nBiobio. There were thirty-five miles more to travel before they were\nout of Chili.\n\nThe country had not changed. It was still rich in amaryllis, violets,\ndate-trees, and golden-flowered cactuses. A few animals, among\nothers the ocelot, inhabited the thickets. A heron, a solitary owl,\nthrushes and snipes wary of the talons of the hawk, were the only\nrepresentatives of the feathered tribe.\n\nOf the natives few were seen; only some \"guassos\" (degenerate children\nof the Indians and Spanish), galloping on horses which they lacerated\nwith the gigantic spurs that adorned their naked feet, and passing\nlike shadows. They met on the way no one who could inform them, and\ninquiries were therefore utterly impossible.\n\n[Sidenote: AN ASTONISHED CATAPAZ.]\n\nGlenarvan thought that Captain Grant, if prisoner of the Indians, must\nhave been carried by them beyond the Andes. Their search could be\nsuccessful only in the Pampas. They must be patient, and travel on\nswiftly and continuously.\n\n[Illustration: By means of a ford, they crossed the Rio Tubal, the\nmountains visible in the distance.]\n\nThey advanced in the same order as before, which Robert with difficulty\nkept, for his eagerness led him to press forward, to the great\nannoyance of his animal. Nothing but a command from Glenarvan would\nkeep the young boy at his place in the line. The country now became\nmore uneven; and several hillocks indicated that they were approaching\nthe mountains.\n\nPaganel still continued his study of Spanish.\n\n\"What a language it is!\" exclaimed he; \"so full and sonorous!\"\n\n\"But you are making progress, of course?\" replied Glenarvan.\n\n\"Certainly, my dear lord. Ah! if there were only no accent! But, alas!\nthere is one!\"\n\nIn studying this language, Paganel did not, however, neglect his\ngeographical observations. In these, indeed, he was astonishingly\nclever, and could not have found his superior. When Glenarvan\nquestioned the catapaz about some peculiarity of the country, his\nlearned companion would always anticipate the answer of the guide, who\nthen gazed at him with a look of amazement.\n\nThat same day they met a road which crossed the line that they had\nhitherto pursued. Lord Glenarvan naturally asked its name of their\nguide, and Paganel as naturally answered,--\n\n\"The road from Yumbel to Los Angelos.\"\n\nGlenarvan looked at the catapaz.\n\n\"Exactly,\" replied he.\n\nThen, addressing the geographer, he said,--\n\n\"You have traveled in this country?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" replied Paganel gravely.\n\n\"On a mule?\"\n\n\"No; in an arm-chair.\"\n\nThe catapaz did not understand, for he shrugged his shoulders and\nreturned to the head of the troop.\n\nAt five o'clock in the afternoon they stopped in a shallow gorge, a\nfew miles above the little town of Loja; and that night the travelers\nencamped at the foot of the first slopes of the Andes.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\nELEVEN THOUSAND FEET ALOFT.\n\n\nThe route through Chili had as yet presented no serious obstacles; but\nnow the dangers that attend a journey across the mountains suddenly\nincreased, the struggle with the natural difficulties was about to\nbegin in earnest.\n\nAn important question had to be decided before starting. By what pass\ncould they cross the Andes with the least departure from the prescribed\ncourse? The catapaz was questioned on this subject.\n\n\"I know,\" he replied, \"of but two passes that are practicable in this\npart of the Andes.\"\n\n\"Doubtless the pass of Arica,\" said Paganel, \"which was discovered by\nValdivia Mendoza.\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\n\"And that of Villarica, situated to the south of Nevado.\"\n\n\"You are right.\"\n\n\"Well, my friend, these two passes have only one difficulty; they will\ncarry us to the south, or the north, farther than we wish.\"\n\n\"Have you another pass to propose?"}, {"chunk_id": 34, "text": "ompany\nof mules and Indians, that he could not converse with the travelers.\nHence it was easy for Glenarvan to make known his wishes, and for\nthe muleteer to execute his orders, of which circumstance the former\navailed himself, since Paganel had not yet succeeded in making himself\nunderstood.\n\nThis leader, or \"catapaz,\" in the language of Chili, was assisted by\ntwo native peons and a boy of twelve. The peons had charge of the\nmules laden with the baggage of the party, and the boy led the madrina\n(little mare), which wore small bells, and went in advance of the other\nten mules. The travelers were mounted on seven, and the catapaz on one,\nof these animals, while the two others carried the provisions and a\nfew rolls of cloth designed to insure the good-will of the chiefs of\nthe plains. The peons traveled on foot according to their custom. This\njourney in South America was, therefore, to be performed under the most\nfavorable conditions of safety and speed.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nCrossing the Andes is not an ordinary journey. It cannot be undertaken\nwithout employing those hardy mules, of which the most preferable\nbelong to the Argentine Republic. These excellent animals have attained\nin that country a development superior to their pristine quality and\nstrength. They are not very particular about their food, drink only\nonce a day, and easily make ten leagues in eight hours.\n\nThere are no taverns on this route, from one ocean to the other. You\neat dried meat, rice seasoned with allspice, and whatever game can be\ncaptured on the way. In the mountains the torrents, and in the plains\nthe rivers, furnish water, generally flavored with a few drops of rum,\nof which each has a supply in an ox-horn called \"chiffle.\" However,\ncare must be taken not to indulge too much in alcoholic drinks, which\nare specially injurious in a region where the nervous system is\npeculiarly excited.\n\nAs for your bedding, it consists merely of the native saddle called\n\"recado.\" This saddle is made of sheep-skins tanned on one side and\ncovered with wool on the other, and is supported by broad girths\nelaborately embroidered. A traveler wrapped in one of these warm\ncoverings can brave with impunity the dampness of the nights, and enjoy\nthe soundest repose.\n\nGlenarvan, who knew how to travel and conform to the customs of\ndifferent countries, had adopted the Chilian costume for himself and\nhis friends. Paganel and Robert, two children (a large and a small\none), felt no pleasure in introducing their heads into the national\nponcho (a large blanket with a hole in the centre), and their legs\ninto leathern stirrups. They would rather have seen their mules\nrichly caparisoned, with the Arab bit in their mouths, a long bridle\nof braided leather for a whip, and their heads adorned with metal\nornaments and the \"alforjas\" (double saddle-bags containing the\nprovisions).\n\n[Sidenote: LAND AND WATER.]\n\nPaganel, always absent-minded, received three or four kicks from his\nexcellent animal just as he was mounting. Once in the saddle, however,\nwith his inseparable telescope in a sling and his feet confined in the\nstirrups, he confided himself to the sagacity of his beast, and had\nno reason to repent. As for young Robert, he showed from the first a\nremarkable capacity for becoming an excellent horseman.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThey started. The day was magnificent, the sky was perfectly clear,\nand the atmosphere sufficiently refreshed by the sea-breezes in spite\nof the heat of the sun. The little party followed at a rapid pace the\nwinding shores of the bay, and made good progress the first day across\nthe reeds of old dried marshes. Little was said. The parting farewells\nhad left a deep impression upon the minds of all. They could still see\nthe smoke of the Duncan as she gradually disappeared on the horizon.\nAll were silent, except Paganel; this studious geographer kept asking\nhimself questions, and answering them, in his new language.\n\nThe catapaz was, moreover, quite a taciturn man, whose avocation ha"}, {"chunk_id": 53, "text": "e human skeleton had added its bones to those of\nthese humbler animals.\n\nHitherto Thalcave had made no remark concerning the line so rigorously\nfollowed. He understood, however, that if they kept no definite\ncourse over the Pampas, they would not come to cities or villages.\nEvery morning they advanced towards the rising sun, without deviating\nfrom the straight line, and every evening the setting sun was behind\nthem. In his capacity of guide, Thalcave must, therefore, have been\nastonished to see that not only he did not guide them, but that they\nguided him. Nevertheless, if he was astonished, with the reserve\nnatural to the Indians he made no remark. But to-day arriving at the\nabove-mentioned road, he stopped his horse, and turned towards Paganel.\n\n\"Road to Carmen,\" said he.\n\n\"Yes, my good Patagonian,\" replied the geographer, in his purest\nSpanish; \"road to Carmen and Mendoza.\"\n\n\"We do not take it?\" resumed Thalcave.\n\n\"No,\" answered Paganel.\n\n\"And we are going----?\"\n\n\"Always to the east.\"\n\n\"That is going nowhere.\"\n\n\"Who knows?\"\n\nThalcave was silent, and gazed at the geographer with profound\nsurprise. He did not admit, however, that Paganel was joking the least\nin the world. An Indian, with his natural seriousness, never imagines\nthat you are not speaking in earnest.\n\n\"You are not going to Carmen then?\" he added, after an instant of\nsilence.\n\n[Sidenote: A PROFESSORIAL DIFFICULTY.]\n\n\"No,\" replied Paganel.\n\n\"Nor to Mendoza?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nAt this moment Glenarvan, rejoining Paganel, asked what Thalcave said,\nand why he had stopped.\n\nWhen he had told him, Glenarvan said,--\n\n\"Could you not explain to him the object of our expedition, and why we\nmust always proceed toward the east?\"\n\n\"That would be very difficult,\" answered Paganel, \"for an Indian\nunderstands nothing of geography.\"\n\n\"But,\" said the major seriously, \"is it the history, or the historian,\nthat he cannot understand?\"\n\n\"Ah, MacNabb,\" said Paganel, \"you still doubt my Spanish!\"\n\n\"Try, my worthy friend.\"\n\n\"Very well.\"\n\nPaganel turned to the Patagonian, and began a discourse, frequently\ninterrupted for want of words and from the difficulty of explaining to\na half-ignorant savage details which were rather incomprehensible to\nhim.\n\nThe geographer was just then a curious sight. He gesticulated,\narticulated, and exerted himself in a hundred ways, while great\ndrops of sweat rolled down his face. When his tongue could no longer\nmove, his arm came to his aid. He dismounted, and traced on the\nsand a geographical map, with lines of latitude and longitude, the\ntwo oceans, and the road to Carmen. Never was professor in such\nembarrassment. Thalcave watched these manoeuvres without showing whether\nhe comprehended or not.\n\nThe lesson in geography lasted more than half an hour. At last Paganel\nceased, wiped his face, which was wet with perspiration, and looked at\nthe Patagonian.\n\n\"Did he understand?\" inquired Glenarvan.\n\n\"We shall see,\" replied Paganel; \"but, if he did not, I give it up.\"\n\n[Sidenote: \"PERHAPS!\"]\n\nThalcave did not stir. He no longer spoke. His eyes were fixed upon\nthe figures traced on the sand, which the wind was gradually effacing.\n\n[Illustration: An important road--that from Carmen to\nMendoza--distinguishable by the bones of such animals as mules, horses,\nsheep and oxen, whose remains were scattered by the birds of prey, and\nlay bleaching in the sun.]\n\n\"Well?\" asked Paganel.\n\nThalcave did not appear to hear him. Paganel already saw an ironical\nsmile forming upon the lips of the major, and, wishing to save\nhis reputation, had begun with renewed energy his geographical\ndemonstrations, when the Patagonian stopped him with a gesture.\n\n\"You are searching for a prisoner?\" he said.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Paganel.\n\n\"And exactly on the line from the setting to the rising sun?\" said\nThalcave, indicating by a comparison, in the Indian manner, the course\nfrom west to east.\n\n\"Yes, yes, that is it!\"\n\n\"And it is your God,\" said the Patagonian, \"who has confided to the\nwaves of the vast ocean the se"}, {"chunk_id": 55, "text": "sation. It was possible that the three\nprisoners had been separated a long time. But the substance of the\nPatagonian's information was that the Indians spoke of a European who\nhad fallen into their power. The date of his captivity, the place where\nhe must have been, everything, even to the Patagonian phrase used to\nexpress his courage, related evidently to Captain Harry Grant.\n\nTheir progress was now somewhat slow and difficult; their next object\nbeing to reach and cross the river Colorado, to which at length\ntheir horses brought them. Here Paganel's first care was to bathe\n\"geographically\" in its waters, which are colored by a reddish clay. He\nwas surprised to find the depth so great as it really was, this being\nthe result of the snow having melted rapidly under the first heat of\nsummer. The width likewise of this stream was so considerable that it\nwas almost impossible for their horses to swim across; but they happily\ndiscovered a sort of weir-bridge, of wattles looped and fastened\ntogether, which the Indians were in the habit of using; and by its aid\nthe little troop was enabled to pass over to the left bank, where they\nrested for the night.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\nA SERIOUS NECESSITY.\n\n\nThey set out at daybreak. The horses advanced at a brisk pace among\nthe tufts of \"paja-brava,\" a kind of grass that serves the Indians\nas a shelter during the storms. At certain distances, but less and\nless frequent, pools of shallow water contributed to the growth of\nwillows and a certain plant which is found in the neighborhood of\nfresh water. Here the horses drank their fill, to fortify themselves\nfor the journey. Thalcave, who rode in advance, beat the bushes, and\nthus frightened away the \"cholinas\" (vipers), while the agile Thaouka\nbounded over all obstacles, and aided his master in clearing a passage\nfor the horses that followed.\n\n[Illustration: They set out at daybreak. The horses advanced at a brisk\npace among the tufts of \"paja-brava,\" a kind of grass that serves the\nIndians as a shelter during the storms.]\n\nEarly in the afternoon, the first traces of animals were\nencountered--the bones of an innumerable drove of cattle, in whitened\nheaps. These fragments did not extend in a winding line, such as\nanimals exhausted and falling one by one would leave behind them. Thus\nno one, not even Paganel, knew how to explain this chain of skeletons\nin a space comparatively circumscribed. He therefore questioned\nThalcave, who was not at a loss for a reply.\n\n\"What is this?\" they asked, after Paganel had inquired of the Indian.\n\n\"The fire of heaven,\" replied the geographer.\n\n\"What! the lightning could not have produced such a disaster,\" said Tom\nAustin, \"and stretched five hundred head of cattle on the earth!\"\n\nBut Thalcave reaffirmed it, and he was not mistaken; for the storms of\nthe Pampas are noted for their violence.\n\nAt evening they stopped at an abandoned rancho, made of interlaced\nbranches plastered with mud and covered with thatch. This structure\nstood within an inclosure of half-rotten stakes which, however,\nsufficed to protect the horses during the night against the attacks of\nthe foxes. Not that they had anything to fear personally from these\nanimals, but the malicious beasts gnawed the halters, so that the\nhorses could escape.\n\nA few paces from the rancho, a hole was dug which served as a kitchen\nand contained half-cooled embers. Within, there was a bench, a bed of\nox-hide, a saucepan, a spit, and a pot for boiling maté. The maté is\na drink very much in use in South America. It is the Indian's tea,\nconsisting of a decoction of leaves dried in the fire, and is imbibed\nthrough a straw. At Paganel's request, Thalcave prepared several\ncups of this beverage, which very agreeably accompanied the ordinary\neatables, and was declared excellent.\n\n[Sidenote: A CHANGE FOR THE WORSE.]\n\nThe next day they resumed their journey towards the east. About noon\na change took place in the appearance of the Pampas, which could\nnot escape eyes weari"}]}
{"claim_id": "49_1", "row_id": 49, "book_name": "In Search of the Castaways", "character": "Thalcave", "claim_text": "Thalcave dodging bandits.", "evidence": [{"chunk_id": 63, "text": " I should not even think of them.\"\n\n\"What does it matter?\" replied Robert. \"We are well armed. Let them\ncome.\"\n\n\"And they shall be well received.\"\n\nSpeaking thus, Glenarvan endeavored to reassure the lad; but he did\nnot think without a secret terror of that dense horde of exasperated\nbeasts. Perhaps there were hundreds of them; and these three, however\nwell armed, could not advantageously contend against so many and such\nantagonists.\n\nBy the howls that resounded over the Pampas, and by the multitude of\nshadows that flitted about the plain, Glenarvan could not be mistaken\nas to the number. These animals had scented a sure prey, horse-flesh or\nhuman flesh, and not one among them would return to his lair without\nhaving his portion. The situation was, therefore, very alarming.\n\nMeanwhile the circle of wolves grew gradually narrower. The horses,\nawakened, gave signs of the liveliest terror. Thaouka alone pawed the\nground, seeking to break his halter, and ready to rush out. His master\nsucceeded in calming him only by whistling continually.\n\nGlenarvan and Robert had stationed themselves so as to defend the\nentrance of the ramada, and with their loaded rifles were about to fire\nat the first ranks of wolves, when Thalcave turned aside their weapons\nalready poised for a shot.\n\n\"What does Thalcave wish?\" asked Robert.\n\n\"He prohibits us from firing,\" answered Glenarvan.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Perhaps he does not consider it the proper time.\"\n\nThis was not, however, the motive which actuated the Indian, but a\ngraver reason, which Glenarvan understood when Thalcave, raising his\npowder-flask and inverting it, showed that it was almost empty.\n\n\"Well?\" said Robert.\n\n\"We must economize our ammunition. Our hunt to-day has cost us dear,\nand we are deficient in powder and shot. We have not twenty charges\nleft.\"\n\nThe boy answered nothing.\n\n\"You are not afraid, Robert?\"\n\n\"No, my lord.\"\n\n\"Very well, my boy.\"\n\nAt this moment another report resounded. Thalcave had brought down a\ntoo bold enemy. The wolves that were advancing in close ranks recoiled,\nand gathered together again a hundred paces from the inclosure.\n\n[Sidenote: THE LAST HOUR.]\n\nGlenarvan, at a sign from the Indian, took his place at once, while the\nlatter, collecting the bedding, grass, and all combustible materials,\npiled them at the entrance of the ramada and threw on a burning ember.\nSoon a curtain of flame was defined against the dark background of the\nsky, and through the openings the plain appeared illumined by great\nmoving reflections. Glenarvan could therefore judge of the great number\nof animals against which they had to defend themselves. Never had so\nmany wolves been seen together before, nor so excited by rapacity. The\nfiery barrier that Thalcave had just opposed to them had redoubled\ntheir fury. Some, however, advanced to the very fire, crowded by\nthe rear ranks, and burned their paws. From time to time a shot was\nnecessary to check the howling horde, and at the end of an hour fifteen\nbodies lay on the prairie.\n\nThe besieged were now in a situation relatively less dangerous. So long\nas their supplies lasted, so long as the barrier of fire stood at the\nentrance to the ramada, invasion was not to be feared. But what was to\nbe done if all these methods of repelling the wolves should fail at the\nsame time?\n\nGlenarvan gazed at Robert, and felt his heart beat quick with\nexcitement. He forgot himself, and thought only of this poor child, who\ndisplayed a courage beyond his years. Robert was pale, but his hand did\nnot leave his weapon, and he awaited with firm bearing the assault of\nthe enraged wolves.\n\nMeantime, Glenarvan, after coolly considering the situation, resolved\nto do something decisive.\n\n\"In one hour,\" said he, \"we shall have no more powder, shot, or fire.\nWe must not wait till then to make a sally.\"\n\nHe turned towards Thalcave, and, recalling a few words of Spanish,\nbegan a conversation with the Indian, frequently interrupted by the\ncracks of the rifle.\n\nIt was not without difficulty th"}, {"chunk_id": 77, "text": "fled away in the track of Thaouka.\n\nIt was time. Five miles to the south a high and broad wall of water\nwas rushing over the plain, which was fast becoming an ocean. The tall\ngrass disappeared as before the scythe, and the tufts of mimosas, torn\nup by the current, separated and formed floating islands. The mass of\nwaters spread itself in broad waves of irresistible power. The dikes of\nthe great rivers had evidently given way, and perhaps the waters of the\nColorado and Rio Negro were now mingling in a common stream.\n\nThe wall of water descried by Thalcave advanced with the speed of a\nrace-horse. The travelers fled before it like a cloud driven by the\nstorm. Their eyes sought in vain a place of refuge. Sky and water\nmingled together on the horizon. The horses, excited by the danger,\ndashed along in a mad gallop, so that their riders could scarcely keep\ntheir seats. Glenarvan frequently glanced behind him.\n\n\"The water is overtaking us,\" he thought.\n\n\"Quick! quick!\" cried Thalcave.\n\n[Sidenote: THE ARK.]\n\nThe unfortunate beasts were urged to a swifter pace. From their flanks,\nlacerated with the spur, flowed bright red streams, which marked\ntheir course on the water by long, crimson lines. They stumbled in\nthe hollows of the ground; they were entangled in the hidden grass;\nthey fell and rose again continually. The depth of the water sensibly\nincreased. Long surges announced the on-rush of the mass of water that\ntossed its foaming crests less than two miles distant.\n\nFor a quarter of an hour this final struggle against the most terrible\nof elements was prolonged. The fugitives could keep no account of the\ndistance they had traversed; but, judging by the rapidity of their\nflight, it must have been considerable.\n\nMeantime the horses, immersed to their breasts, could no longer\nadvance without extreme difficulty. Glenarvan, Paganel, Austin, all\nbelieved themselves lost, victims of the horrible death of unfortunates\nabandoned at sea. Their animals began to lose their footing; six feet\nof water was sufficient to drown them.\n\nWe must forbear to picture the acute anguish of these eight men\novertaken by a rising inundation. They felt their powerlessness to\nstruggle against these convulsions of nature, superior to human\nstrength. Their safety was no longer in their own hands.\n\nFive minutes after, the horses were swimming, while the current alone\ncarried them along with irresistible force and furious swiftness. All\nsafety seemed impossible, when the voice of the major was heard.\n\n\"A tree!\" said he.\n\n\"A tree!\" cried Glenarvan.\n\n\"Yes, yonder!\" replied Thalcave, and he pointed northward to a kind of\ngigantic walnut-tree, which rose solitary from the midst of the waters.\n\nHis companions had no need to be urged. This tree that was opportunely\npresented to them they must reach at all hazards. The horses probably\ncould not accomplish the distance; but the men, at least, could be\nsaved,--the current would carry them.\n\nAt that moment Tom Austin's horse gave a stifled neigh and disappeared.\nHis rider, extricating himself from the stirrups, began to swim\nvigorously.\n\n\"Cling to my saddle!\" cried Glenarvan to him.\n\n\"Thanks, my lord,\" replied he, \"my arms are strong.\"\n\n\"Your horse, Robert?\" continued Glenarvan, turning towards the boy.\n\n\"All right, my lord, all right! He swims like a fish.\"\n\n\"Attention!\" cried the major, in a loud voice.\n\nThis word was scarcely pronounced, when the enormous wall of water\nreached them. A huge wave, forty feet high, overwhelmed the fugitives\nwith a terrible roar. Men and beasts, everything, disappeared in a\nwhirlpool of foam. A ponderous liquid mass engulfed them in its furious\ntide. When the deluge had passed, the men regained the surface, and\nrapidly counted their numbers; but the horses, except Thaouka, had\ndisappeared forever.\n\n\"Courage! courage!\" cried Glenarvan, who supported Paganel with one arm\nand swam with the other.\n\n\"All right! all right!\" replied the worthy geographer; \"indeed I am not\nsorry----\"\n\nWhat was he not "}, {"chunk_id": 50, "text": "lt\nhis wounded limbs. Then, smiling, he went and gathered on the banks\nof the stream a few handfuls of wild celery, with which he rubbed the\nboy's body. Under this treatment, performed with an extreme gentleness,\nthe child felt his strength revive, and it was plain that a few hours\nwould suffice to restore him.\n\nIt was therefore decided that that day and the following night should\nbe passed at the encampment. Besides, two important questions remained\nto be settled--food, and means of conveyance. Provisions and mules were\nboth wanting.\n\nFortunately Thalcave solved the difficulty. This guide, who was\naccustomed to conduct travelers along the Patagonian frontiers, and\nwas one of the most intelligent baqueanos of the country, engaged to\nfurnish Glenarvan all that his little party needed. He offered to take\nhim to a \"tolderia\" (encampment) of Indians, about four miles distant,\nwhere they would find everything necessary for the expedition. This\nproposal was made partly by gestures, partly by Spanish words which\nPaganel succeeded in understanding. It was accepted, and Glenarvan and\nhis learned friend, taking leave of their companions, reascended the\nstream under the guidance of the Patagonian.\n\nThey proceeded at a good pace for an hour and a half, taking long\nstrides to keep up to the giant Thalcave. All the region was charming,\nand of a rich fertility. The grassy pastures succeeded each other,\nand could easily have fed thousands of cattle. Large ponds, united by\na winding chain of streams, gave these plains a verdant moisture.\nBlack-headed swans sported on the mirror-like surface, and disputed the\nempire of the waters with numberless ostriches that gamboled over the\nplains, while the brilliant feathered tribes were in wonderful variety.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nJacques Paganel proceeded from admiration to ecstasy. Exclamations\nof delight continually escaped his lips, to the astonishment of the\nPatagonian, who thought it very natural that there should be birds in\nthe air, swans on the lakes, and grass on the prairies. The geographer\nhad no reason to regret his walk, or complain of its length. He\nscarcely believed himself started, or that the encampment would soon\ncome in sight.\n\nThis tolderia was at the bottom of a narrow valley among the mountains.\nHere in huts of branches lived thirty wandering natives, grazing\nlarge herds of milch cows, sheep, cattle and horses. Thus they roamed\nfrom one pasture to another, always finding a repast ready for their\nfour-footed companions.\n\n[Sidenote: GLENARVAN GOING TO MARKET.]\n\nThalcave took upon himself the negotiation, which was not long. In\nreturn for seven small Argentine horses, all saddled, a hundred pounds\nof dried meat, a few measures of rice, and some leathern bottles for\nwater, the Indians received twenty ounces of gold, the value of which\nthey perfectly understood. Glenarvan would have bought another horse\nfor the Patagonian, but he intimated that it was unnecessary.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe bargain concluded, Glenarvan took leave of his new \"providers,\" as\nPaganel expressed it, and returned to the encampment. His arrival was\nwelcomed by cries of joy at sight of the provisions and horses. Every\none ate with avidity. Robert partook of some nourishment; he had almost\nentirely regained his strength, and the remainder of the day was passed\nin perfect rest. Various subjects were alluded to: the absent dear\nones, the Duncan, Captain Mangles, his brave crew, and Harry Grant who\nwas, perhaps, not far distant.\n\nAs for Paganel, he did not leave the Indian. He became Thalcave's\nshadow, and could not remain quiet in the presence of a real\nPatagonian, in comparison with whom he would have passed for a dwarf.\nHe overwhelmed the grave Indian with Spanish phrases, to which the\nlatter quietly listened. The geographer studied this time without a\nbook, and was often heard repeating words aloud.\n\n\"If I do not get the accent,\" said he to the major, \"you must not be\nangry with me. Who would have thought that one day a Pa"}, {"chunk_id": 89, "text": " passing one, and then\neach, getting into his aerial resting-place, wrapped himself in his\nponcho and waited for sleep.\n\n[Illustration: The incessant flashes assumed various forms. Some,\ndarting perpendicularly towards the earth, were repeated five or six\ntimes in the same place; others spread in zigzag lines, and produced on\nthe dark vault of the heavens astonishing jets of arborescent flame.]\n\nBut the approach of a mighty tempest brings to the hearts of most\nsentient beings a vague anxiety of which the bravest cannot divest\nthemselves. The occupants of the tree, agitated and fearful, could not\nclose their eyes, and the first thunder-clap found them all awake.\nIt took place about eleven o'clock, resembling a distant rumbling.\nGlenarvan climbed to the end of the branch, and peered out from the\nfoliage. The dark firmament was fitfully illumined by vivid and\nbrilliant flashes, which the waters brightly reflected, and which\ndisclosed great rifts in the clouds. Glenarvan, after surveying the\nzenith and the horizon, returned to his couch.\n\n\"What do you think, Glenarvan?\" asked Paganel.\n\n\"I think that the storm is beginning, and, if it continues, it will be\nterrible.\"\n\n\"So much the better,\" replied the enthusiastic Paganel. \"I like a fine\nspectacle, especially when I cannot avoid it. Only one thing would make\nme anxious, if anxiety served to avert danger,\" added he, \"and that\nis, that the culminating point of this plain is the ombu upon which we\nare perched. A lightning-conductor would be very useful here, for this\nvery tree among all those of the Pampas is the one that particularly\nattracts the lightning. And then, as you are aware, my friends,\nmeteorologists advise us not to take refuge under trees during a storm.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the major, \"that is timely advice.\"\n\n\"It must be confessed, Paganel,\" replied Glenarvan, \"that you choose a\ngood time to tell us these encouraging things!\"\n\n\"Bah!\" replied Paganel; \"all times are good to receive information. Ah,\nit is beginning!\"\n\n[Sidenote: AN EXTRAORDINARY STORM.]\n\nViolent thunder-claps interrupted this conversation, and their\nintensity increased till they reached the most deafening peals.\nThey soon became sonorous, and made the atmosphere vibrate in rapid\noscillations. The firmament was on fire, and during this commotion\nit was impossible to distinguish from what electric spark emanated\nthe indefinitely-prolonged rumblings that reverberated throughout the\nabysses of the sky.\n\nThe incessant flashes assumed various forms. Some, darting\nperpendicularly towards the earth, were repeated five or six times in\nthe same place; others, separating into a thousand different branches,\nspread in zigzag lines and produced on the dark vault of the heavens\nastonishing jets of arborescent flame. Soon the sky, from east to\nnorth, was crossed by a phosphorescent band of intense brilliancy. This\nillumination gradually overspread the entire horizon, lighting up the\nclouds like a bonfire, and was reflected in the mirror-like waters,\nforming what seemed to be an immense circle of fire, of which the tree\noccupied the centre.\n\nGlenarvan and his companions watched this terrific spectacle in\nsilence. Sheets of dazzling light glided towards them, and blinding\nflashes followed in rapid succession, now showing the calm countenance\nof the major, then the speculative face of Paganel or the energetic\nfeatures of Glenarvan, and again the frightened look of Robert or the\nunconcerned expression of the sailors. The rain, however, did not fall\nas yet, nor had the wind risen. But soon the flood-gates of the heavens\nopened, and the rain came down in torrents, the drops, as they struck\nthe surface of the water, rebounding in thousands of sparks illuminated\nby the incessant lightning.\n\nDid this rain predict the end of the storm? Were Glenarvan and his\ncompanions to be released with a few thorough drenchings? At the height\nof this struggle of the elements, suddenly there appeared at the end\nof the branch which extended horizontal"}, {"chunk_id": 127, "text": "increased, and was now approaching the\nstation. In the midst of the multitude two men were bearing a corpse.\nIt was that of the guard, already cold. A poniard-thrust had pierced\nhim to the heart. The assassins had dragged the body some distance from\nCamden Bridge, doubtless intending by this means to mislead the police\nin their first investigations. This discovery clearly justified the\ndoubts of the officer. The natives had no hand in the crime.\n\n\"Those who struck the blow,\" said he, \"are persons already familiar\nwith the use of these little instruments.\"\n\nAs he spoke he displayed a pair of \"darbies,\" a kind of manacles\nconsisting of a double ring of iron, furnished with a padlock.\n\n\"Before long,\" added he, \"I shall have the pleasure of presenting them\nwith these bracelets as a new year's gift.\"\n\n\"Then you suspect----?\"\n\n\"People who have 'traveled free on Her Majesty's vessels.'\"\n\n\"What! convicts?\" cried Paganel, who recognized the phrase employed in\nthe Australian colonies.\n\n\"I thought,\" observed Glenarvan, \"that those who have been transported\nhad no right to stay in the province of Victoria.\"\n\n\"Ah, well,\" replied the officer, \"if they have not the right, they take\nit! Sometimes they escape; and, if I am not greatly mistaken, these\nfellows have come direct from Perth. Well, they shall return again, you\nmay be sure.\"\n\n[Sidenote: A RAILROAD SLEEPER.]\n\nMr. Mitchell nodded approvingly at the words of the officer. At this\nmoment the cart arrived at the railroad crossing. Glenarvan, wishing\nto spare the ladies the spectacle at Camden Bridge, took leave of the\nsurveyor-general, and made a sign to his companions to follow him.\n\n\"There is no occasion,\" said he, \"for us to interrupt our journey.\"\n\nOn reaching the cart, Glenarvan simply told Lady Helena that a railroad\naccident had taken place, without mentioning the part that the convicts\nhad played in the catastrophe. He reserved this matter that he might\nquestion Ayrton in private. The little party then crossed the track,\nnot far above the bridge, and resumed their route towards the east.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\n\nFRESH FACES.\n\n\nThey had not proceeded far before they reached a native cemetery,\npleasantly situated and with abundance of shady trees. Here for a\ntime they halted, and, whilst Robert and Paganel were exploring, Lord\nand Lady Glenarvan almost stumbled over a queer object. It was human,\nindigenous, and sleeping; but at first this was all that they could\ndecide, until, as the eyes opened and the sleeper roused to active\nlife, they saw before them a boy of eight years, with a notice pinned\nto the back of his jacket which read as follows: \"TOLINÉ*, to be\nconducted to Echuca, care of Jeff Smith, Railway Porter. Prepaid.\"\n\n[Illustration: A boy of eight years, with a notice pinned to the back\nof his jacket which read as follows: \"Toliné, to be conducted to\nEchuca, care of Jeff Smith, Railway Porter. Prepaid.\"]\n\nHere, it would seem, was another waif that Providence had cast in their\npath. They questioned him, and his answers were pertinent and clear. He\nhad been educated in the Wesleyan Methodist day-school at Melbourne,\nand was now going for a time to visit his parents, who were living\nwith the rest of their tribe in Lachlan. He had been in the train to\nwhich the accident had happened, and had, with childlike confidence,\ntroubled less about his fate than did those of older years.

Thus a new, a\nstronger, and more inexorable barrier was interposed to cut off the\nrealization of their hopes.\n\n“You see,” said the young man, with an air of sorrowful resignation, to\nFaria, “that God deems it right to take from me any claim to merit for\nwhat you call my devotion to you. I have promised to remain forever\nwith you, and now I could not break my promise if I would. The treasure\nwill be no more mine than yours, and neither of us will quit this\nprison. But my real treasure is not that, my dear friend, which awaits\nme beneath the sombre rocks of Monte Cristo, it is your presence, our\nliving together five or six hours a day, in spite of our jailers; it is\nthe rays of intelligence you have elicited from my brain, the languages\nyou have implanted in my memory, and which have taken root there with\nall their philological ramifications. These different sciences that you\nhave made so easy to me by the depth of the knowledge you possess of\nthem, and the clearness of the principles to which you have reduced\nthem—this is my treasure, my beloved friend, and with this you have\nmade me rich and happy. Believe me, and take comfort, this is better\nfor me than tons of gold and cases of diamonds, even were they not as\nproblematical as the clouds we see in the morning floating over the\nsea, which we take for _terra firma_, and which evaporate and vanish as\nwe draw near to them. To have you as long as possible near me, to hear\nyour eloquent speech,—which embellishes my mind, strengthens my soul,\nand makes my whole frame capable of great and terrible things, if I\nshould ever be free,—so fills my whole existence, that the despair to\nwhich I was just on the point of yielding when I knew you, has no\nlonger any hold over me; and this—this is my fortune—not chimerical,\nbut actual. I owe you my real good, my present happiness; and all the\nsovereigns of the earth, even Cæsar Borgia himself, could not deprive\nme of this.”\n\nThus, if not actually happy, yet the days these two unfortunates passed\ntogether went quickly. Faria, who for so long a time had kept silence\nas to the treasure, now perpetually talked of it. As he had prophesied\nwould be the case, he remained paralyzed in the right arm and the left\nleg, and had given up all hope of ever enjoying it himself. But he was\ncontinually thinking over some means of escape for his young companion,\nand anticipating the pleasure he would enjoy. For fear the letter might\nbe some day lost or stolen, he compelled Dantès to learn it by heart;\nand Dantès knew it from the first to the last word. Then he destroyed\nthe second portion, assured that if the first were seized, no one would\nbe able to discover its real meaning. Whole hours sometimes passed\nwhile Faria was giving instructions to Dantès,—instructions which were\nto serve him when he was at liberty. Then, once free, from the day and\nhour and moment when he was so, he could have but one only thought,\nwhich was, to gain Monte Cristo by some means, and remain there alone\nunder some pretext which would arouse no suspicions; and once there, to\nendeavor to find the wonderful caverns, and search in the appointed\nspot,—the appointed spot, be it remembered, being the farthest angle in\nthe second opening.\n\nIn the meanwhile the hours passed, if not rapidly, at least tolerably.\nFaria, as we have said, without having recovered the use of his hand\nand foot, had regained all the clearness of his understanding, and had\ngradually, besides the moral instructions we have detailed, taught his\nyouthful companion the patient and sublime duty of a prisoner, who\nlearns to make something from nothing. They were thus perpetually\nemployed,—Faria, that he might not see himself grow old; Dantès, for\nfear of recalling the almost extinct past which now only floated in his\nmemory like a distant light wandering in the night. So life went on for\nthem as it does for those who are not victims of misfortune and whose\nactivities gl"}, {"chunk_id": 97, "text": "ious moment should arrive; their greatest dread\nnow was lest the stone through which the sentry was doomed to fall\nshould give way before its right time, and this they had in some\nmeasure provided against by propping it up with a small beam which they\nhad discovered in the walls through which they had worked their way.\nDantès was occupied in arranging this piece of wood when he heard\nFaria, who had remained in Edmond’s cell for the purpose of cutting a\npeg to secure their rope-ladder, call to him in a tone indicative of\ngreat suffering. Dantès hastened to his dungeon, where he found him\nstanding in the middle of the room, pale as death, his forehead\nstreaming with perspiration, and his hands clenched tightly together.\n\n“Gracious heavens!” exclaimed Dantès, “what is the matter? what has\nhappened?”\n\n“Quick! quick!” returned the abbé, “listen to what I have to say.”\n\nDantès looked in fear and wonder at the livid countenance of Faria,\nwhose eyes, already dull and sunken, were surrounded by purple circles,\nwhile his lips were white as those of a corpse, and his very hair\nseemed to stand on end.\n\n“Tell me, I beseech you, what ails you?” cried Dantès, letting his\nchisel fall to the floor.\n\n“Alas,” faltered out the abbé, “all is over with me. I am seized with a\nterrible, perhaps mortal illness; I can feel that the paroxysm is fast\napproaching. I had a similar attack the year previous to my\nimprisonment. This malady admits but of one remedy; I will tell you\nwhat that is. Go into my cell as quickly as you can; draw out one of\nthe feet that support the bed; you will find it has been hollowed out\nfor the purpose of containing a small phial you will see there\nhalf-filled with a red-looking fluid. Bring it to me—or rather—no,\nno!—I may be found here, therefore help me back to my room while I have\nthe strength to drag myself along. Who knows what may happen, or how\nlong the attack may last?”\n\nIn spite of the magnitude of the misfortune which thus suddenly\nfrustrated his hopes, Dantès did not lose his presence of mind, but\ndescended into the passage, dragging his unfortunate companion with\nhim; then, half-carrying, half-supporting him, he managed to reach the\nabbé’s chamber, when he immediately laid the sufferer on his bed.\n\n“Thanks,” said the poor abbé, shivering as though his veins were filled\nwith ice. “I am about to be seized with a fit of catalepsy; when it\ncomes to its height I shall probably lie still and motionless as though\ndead, uttering neither sigh nor groan. On the other hand, the symptoms\nmay be much more violent, and cause me to fall into fearful\nconvulsions, foam at the mouth, and cry out loudly. Take care my cries\nare not heard, for if they are it is more than probable I should be\nremoved to another part of the prison, and we be separated forever.\nWhen I become quite motionless, cold, and rigid as a corpse, then, and\nnot before,—be careful about this,—force open my teeth with the knife,\npour from eight to ten drops of the liquor contained in the phial down\nmy throat, and I may perhaps revive.”\n\n“Perhaps!” exclaimed Dantès in grief-stricken tones.\n\n“Help! help!” cried the abbé, “I—I—die—I——”\n\n0229m\n\n\n\nSo sudden and violent was the fit that the unfortunate prisoner was\nunable to complete the sentence; a violent convulsion shook his whole\nframe, his eyes started from their sockets, his mouth was drawn on one\nside, his cheeks became purple, he struggled, foamed, dashed himself\nabout, and uttered the most dreadful cries, which, however, Dantès\nprevented from being heard by covering his head with the blanket. The\nfit lasted two hours; then, more helpless than an infant, and colder\nand paler than marble, more crushed and broken than a reed trampled\nunder foot, he fell back, doubled up in one last convulsion, and became\nas rigid as a corpse.\n\nEdmond waited till life seemed extinct in the body of his friend, then,\ntaking up the knife, he with difficulty forced open the closely fixed\njaws, carefully administered the appointed number of"}, {"chunk_id": 650, "text": " then the maid had been below, and like everyone else she thought\nthe young ladies were in their own room; Madame Danglars, therefore,\nwent to bed without a shadow of suspicion, and began to muse over the\nrecent events. In proportion as her memory became clearer, the\noccurrences of the evening were revealed in their true light; what she\nhad taken for confusion was a tumult; what she had regarded as\nsomething distressing, was in reality a disgrace. And then the baroness\nremembered that she had felt no pity for poor Mercédès, who had been\nafflicted with as severe a blow through her husband and son.\n\n“Eugénie,” she said to herself, “is lost, and so are we. The affair, as\nit will be reported, will cover us with shame; for in a society such as\nours satire inflicts a painful and incurable wound. How fortunate that\nEugénie is possessed of that strange character which has so often made\nme tremble!”\n\nAnd her glance was turned towards heaven, where a mysterious Providence\ndisposes all things, and out of a fault, nay, even a vice, sometimes\nproduces a blessing. And then her thoughts, cleaving through space like\na bird in the air, rested on Cavalcanti. This Andrea was a wretch, a\nrobber, an assassin, and yet his manners showed the effects of a sort\nof education, if not a complete one; he had been presented to the world\nwith the appearance of an immense fortune, supported by an honorable\nname. How could she extricate herself from this labyrinth? To whom\nwould she apply to help her out of this painful situation? Debray, to\nwhom she had run, with the first instinct of a woman towards the man\nshe loves, and who yet betrays her,—Debray could but give her advice,\nshe must apply to someone more powerful than he.\n\nThe baroness then thought of M. de Villefort. It was M. de Villefort\nwho had remorselessly brought misfortune into her family, as though\nthey had been strangers. But, no; on reflection, the procureur was not\na merciless man; and it was not the magistrate, slave to his duties,\nbut the friend, the loyal friend, who roughly but firmly cut into the\nvery core of the corruption; it was not the executioner, but the\nsurgeon, who wished to withdraw the honor of Danglars from ignominious\nassociation with the disgraced young man they had presented to the\nworld as their son-in-law. And since Villefort, the friend of Danglars,\nhad acted in this way, no one could suppose that he had been previously\nacquainted with, or had lent himself to, any of Andrea’s intrigues.\nVillefort’s conduct, therefore, upon reflection, appeared to the\nbaroness as if shaped for their mutual advantage. But the inflexibility\nof the procureur should stop there; she would see him the next day, and\nif she could not make him fail in his duties as a magistrate, she\nwould, at least, obtain all the indulgence he could allow. She would\ninvoke the past, recall old recollections; she would supplicate him by\nthe remembrance of guilty, yet happy days. M. de Villefort would stifle\nthe affair; he had only to turn his eyes on one side, and allow Andrea\nto fly, and follow up the crime under that shadow of guilt called\ncontempt of court. And after this reasoning she slept easily.\n\nAt nine o’clock next morning she arose, and without ringing for her\nmaid or giving the least sign of her activity, she dressed herself in\nthe same simple style as on the previous night; then running\ndownstairs, she left the hotel, walked to the Rue de Provence, called a\ncab, and drove to M. de Villefort’s house.\n\nFor the last month this wretched house had presented the gloomy\nappearance of a lazaretto infected with the plague. Some of the\napartments were closed within and without; the shutters were only\nopened to admit a minute’s air, showing the scared face of a footman,\nand immediately afterwards the window would be closed, like a\ngravestone falling on a sepulchre, and the neighbors would say to each\nother in a low voice, “Will there be another funeral today at the\nprocureur’s house?”\n\nMadame Danglars involuntaril"}, {"chunk_id": 71, "text": "inspector; “and the abbé’s plan\nhas not even the merit of originality.”\n\nThen turning to Faria, “I inquired if you are well fed?” said he.\n\n“Swear to me,” replied Faria, “to free me if what I tell you prove\ntrue, and I will stay here while you go to the spot.”\n\n“Are you well fed?” repeated the inspector.\n\n“Monsieur, you run no risk, for, as I told you, I will stay here; so\nthere is no chance of my escaping.”\n\n“You do not reply to my question,” replied the inspector impatiently.\n\n“Nor you to mine,” cried the abbé. “You will not accept my gold; I will\nkeep it for myself. You refuse me my liberty; God will give it me.” And\nthe abbé, casting away his coverlet, resumed his place, and continued\nhis calculations.\n\n0177m\n\n\n\n“What is he doing there?” said the inspector.\n\n“Counting his treasures,” replied the governor.\n\nFaria replied to this sarcasm with a glance of profound contempt. They\nwent out. The turnkey closed the door behind them.\n\n“He was wealthy once, perhaps?” said the inspector.\n\n“Or dreamed he was, and awoke mad.”\n\n“After all,” said the inspector, “if he had been rich, he would not\nhave been here.”\n\nSo the matter ended for the Abbé Faria. He remained in his cell, and\nthis visit only increased the belief in his insanity.\n\nCaligula or Nero, those treasure-seekers, those desirers of the\nimpossible, would have accorded to the poor wretch, in exchange for his\nwealth, the liberty he so earnestly prayed for. But the kings of modern\ntimes, restrained by the limits of mere probability, have neither\ncourage nor desire. They fear the ear that hears their orders, and the\neye that scrutinizes their actions. Formerly they believed themselves\nsprung from Jupiter, and shielded by their birth; but nowadays they are\nnot inviolable.\n\nIt has always been against the policy of despotic governments to suffer\nthe victims of their persecutions to reappear. As the Inquisition\nrarely allowed its victims to be seen with their limbs distorted and\ntheir flesh lacerated by torture, so madness is always concealed in its\ncell, from whence, should it depart, it is conveyed to some gloomy\nhospital, where the doctor has no thought for man or mind in the\nmutilated being the jailer delivers to him. The very madness of the\nAbbé Faria, gone mad in prison, condemned him to perpetual captivity.\n\nThe inspector kept his word with Dantès; he examined the register, and\nfound the following note concerning him:\n\n_Edmond Dantès:_\n\nViolent Bonapartist; took an active part in the return from Elba.\n\nThe greatest watchfulness and care to be exercised.\n\nThis note was in a different hand from the rest, which showed that it\nhad been added since his confinement. The inspector could not contend\nagainst this accusation; he simply wrote, _Nothing to be done._\n\nThis visit had infused new vigor into Dantès; he had, till then,\nforgotten the date; but now, with a fragment of plaster, he wrote the\ndate, 30th July, 1816, and made a mark every day, in order not to lose\nhis reckoning again. Days and weeks passed away, then months—Dantès\nstill waited; he at first expected to be freed in a fortnight. This\nfortnight expired, he decided that the inspector would do nothing until\nhis return to Paris, and that he would not reach there until his\ncircuit was finished, he therefore fixed three months; three months\npassed away, then six more. Finally ten months and a half had gone by\nand no favorable change had taken place, and Dantès began to fancy the\ninspector’s visit but a dream, an illusion of the brain.\n\nAt the expiration of a year the governor was transferred; he had\nobtained charge of the fortress at Ham. He took with him several of his\nsubordinates, and amongst them Dantès’ jailer. A new governor arrived;\nit would have been too tedious to acquire the names of the prisoners;\nhe learned their numbers instead. This horrible place contained fifty\ncells; their inhabitants were designated by the numbers of their cell,\nand the unhappy young man was no longer called Edmond Dantès—he was now\nnumber 3"}, {"chunk_id": 109, "text": "gradually, besides the moral instructions we have detailed, taught his\nyouthful companion the patient and sublime duty of a prisoner, who\nlearns to make something from nothing.

So life went on for\nthem as it does for those who are not victims of misfortune and whose\nactivities glide along mechanically and tranquilly beneath the eye of\nProvidence.\n\nBut beneath this superficial calm there were in the heart of the young\nman, and perhaps in that of the old man, many repressed desires, many\nstifled sighs, which found vent when Faria was left alone, and when\nEdmond returned to his cell.\n\nOne night Edmond awoke suddenly, believing that he heard someone\ncalling him. He opened his eyes upon utter darkness. His name, or\nrather a plaintive voice which essayed to pronounce his name, reached\nhim. He sat up in bed and a cold sweat broke out upon his brow.\nUndoubtedly the call came from Faria’s dungeon.\n\n“Alas,” murmured Edmond; “can it be?”\n\nHe moved his bed, drew up the stone, rushed into the passage, and\nreached the opposite extremity; the secret entrance was open. By the\nlight of the wretched and wavering lamp, of which we have spoken,\nDantès saw the old man, pale, but yet erect, clinging to the bedstead.\nHis features were writhing with those horrible symptoms which he\nalready knew, and which had so seriously alarmed him when he saw them\nfor the first time.\n\n“Alas, my dear friend,” said Faria in a resigned tone, “you understand,\ndo you not, and I need not attempt to explain to you?”\n\nEdmond uttered a cry of agony, and, quite out of his senses, rushed\ntowards the door, exclaiming, “Help, help!”\n\nFaria had just sufficient strength to restrain him.\n\n“Silence,” he said, “or you are lost. We must now only think of you, my\ndear friend, and so act as to render your captivity supportable or your\nflight possible. It would require years to do again what I have done\nhere, and the results would be instantly destroyed if our jailers knew\nwe had communicated with each other. Besides, be assured, my dear\nEdmond, the dungeon I am about to leave will not long remain empty;\nsome other unfortunate being will soon take my place, and to him you\nwill appear like an angel of salvation. Perhaps he will be young,\nstrong, and enduring, like yourself, and will aid you in your escape,\nwhile I have been but a hindrance. You will no longer have half a dead\nbody tied to you as a drag to all your movements. At length Providence\nhas done something for you; he restores to you more than he takes away,\nand it was time I should die.”\n\nEdmond could only clasp his hands and exclaim, “Oh, my friend, my\nfriend, speak not thus!” and then resuming all his presence of mind,\nwhich had for a moment staggered under this blow, and his strength,\nwhich had failed at the words of the old man, he said, “Oh, I have\nsaved you once, and I will save you a second time!” And raising the\nfoot of the bed, he drew out the phial, still a third filled with the\nred liquor.\n\n“See,” he exclaimed, “there remains still some of the magic draught.\nQuick, quick! tell me what I must do this time; are there any fresh\ninstructions? Speak, my friend; I listen.”\n\n“There is not a hope,” replied Faria, shaking his head, “but no matter;\nGod wills it that man whom he has created, and in whose heart he has so\nprofoundly rooted the love of life, should do all in his power to\npreserve that existence, which, however painful it may be, is yet\nalways so dear.”\n\n“Oh, yes, yes!” exclaimed Dantès; “and I tell you that I will save you\nyet.”\n\n“Well, then, try. The cold gains upon me. I feel the blood flowing\ntowards my brain.

He cried\nout, and staggered against the wall like a drunken man, then he hurried\nto the opening that led from the abbé’s cell to his own, and said, “I\nmust be alone, to think over all this.”\n\nWhen he regained his dungeon, he threw himself on his bed, where the\nturnkey found him in the evening visit, sitting with fixed gaze and\ncontracted features, dumb and motionless as a statue. During these\nhours of profound meditation, which to him had seemed only minutes, he\nhad formed a fearful resolution, and bound himself to its fulfilment by\na solemn oath.\n\nDantès was at length roused from his reverie by the voice of Faria,\nwho, having also been visited by his jailer, had come to invite his\nfellow-sufferer to share his supper. The reputation of being out of his\nmind, though harmlessly and even amusingly so, had procured for the\nabbé unusual privileges. He was supplied with bread of a finer, whiter\nquality than the usual prison fare, and even regaled each Sunday with a\nsmall quantity of wine. Now this was a Sunday, and the abbé had come to\nask his young companion to share the luxuries with him.\n\nDantès followed him; his features were no longer contracted, and now\nwore their usual expression, but there was that in his whole appearance\nthat bespoke one who had come to a fixed and desperate resolve. Faria\nbent on him his penetrating eye.\n\n“I regret now,” said he, “having helped you in your late inquiries, or\nhaving given you the information I did.”\n\n“Why so?” inquired Dantès.\n\n“Because it has instilled a new passion in your heart—that of\nvengeance.”\n\nDantès smiled. “Let us talk of something else,” said he.\n\nAgain the abbé looked at him, then mournfully shook his head; but in\naccordance with Dantès’ request, he began to speak of other matters.\nThe elder prisoner was one of those persons whose conversation, like\nthat of all who have experienced many trials, contained many useful and\nimportant hints as well as sound information; but it was never\negotistical, for the unfortunate man never alluded to his own sorrows.\nDantès listened with admiring attention to all he said; some of his\nremarks corresponded with what he already knew, or applied to the sort\nof knowledge his nautical life had enabled him to acquire. A part of\nthe good abbé’s words, however, were wholly incomprehensible to him;\nbut, like the aurora which guides the navigator in northern latitudes,\nopened new vistas to the inquiring mind of the listener, and gave\nfantastic glimpses of new horizons, enabling him justly to estimate the\ndelight an intellectual mind would have in following one so richly\ngifted as Faria along the heights of truth, where he was so much at\nhome.\n\n“You must teach me a small part of what you know,” said Dantès, “if\nonly to prevent your growing weary of me. I can well believe that so\nlearned a person as yourself would prefer absolute solitude to being\ntormented with the company of one as ignorant and uninformed as myself.\nIf you will only agree to my request, I promise you never to mention\nanother word about escaping.”\n\nThe abbé smiled.\n\n“Alas, my boy,” said he, “human knowledge is confined within very\nnarrow limits; and when I have taught you mathematics, physics,\nhistory, and the three or four modern languages with which I am\nacquainted, you will know as much as I do myself. Now, it will scarcely\nrequire two years for me to communicate to you the stock of learning I\npossess.”\n\n“Two years!” exclaimed Dantès; “do you really believe I can acquire all\nthese things in so short a time?”\n\n“Not their application, certainly, but their principles you may; to\nlearn is not to know; there are the learners and the learned. Memory\nmakes the one, philosophy the other.”\n\n“But cannot one learn philosophy?”\n\n“Philosophy cannot be taught; it is the application of the sciences to\ntruth; it is like the golden cloud in which the Messiah went up into\nheaven.”\n\n“Well, then,” said Dantès, “What shall you teach me first? I am"}, {"chunk_id": 101, "text": " to belong to him alo...\n\nheir.\n\n                    “25th April, 149’”\n\n\n“Well!” said Faria, when the young man had finished reading it.\n\n“Why,” replied Dantès, “I see nothing but broken lines and unconnected\nwords, which are rendered illegible by fire.”\n\n“Yes, to you, my friend, who read them for the first time; but not for\nme, who have grown pale over them by many nights’ study, and have\nreconstructed every phrase, completed every thought.”\n\n“And do you believe you have discovered the hidden meaning?”\n\n“I am sure I have, and you shall judge for yourself; but first listen\nto the history of this paper.”\n\n“Silence!” exclaimed Dantès. “Steps approach—I go—adieu!”\n\nAnd Dantès, happy to escape the history and explanation which would be\nsure to confirm his belief in his friend’s mental instability, glided\nlike a snake along the narrow passage; while Faria, restored by his\nalarm to a certain amount of activity, pushed the stone into place with\nhis foot, and covered it with a mat in order the more effectually to\navoid discovery.\n\nIt was the governor, who, hearing of Faria’s illness from the jailer,\nhad come in person to see him.\n\nFaria sat up to receive him, avoiding all gestures in order that he\nmight conceal from the governor the paralysis that had already half\nstricken him with death. His fear was lest the governor, touched with\npity, might order him to be removed to better quarters, and thus\nseparate him from his young companion. But fortunately this was not the\ncase, and the governor left him, convinced that the poor madman, for\nwhom in his heart he felt a kind of affection, was only troubled with a\nslight indisposition.\n\nDuring this time, Edmond, seated on his bed with his head in his hands,\ntried to collect his scattered thoughts. Faria, since their first\nacquaintance, had been on all points so rational and logical, so\nwonderfully sagacious, in fact, that he could not understand how so\nmuch wisdom on all points could be allied with madness. Was Faria\ndeceived as to his treasure, or was all the world deceived as to Faria?\n\nDantès remained in his cell all day, not daring to return to his\nfriend, thinking thus to defer the moment when he should be convinced,\nonce for all, that the abbé was mad—such a conviction would be so\nterrible!\n\nBut, towards the evening after the hour for the customary visit had\ngone by, Faria, not seeing the young man appear, tried to move and get\nover the distance which separated them. Edmond shuddered when he heard\nthe painful efforts which the old man made to drag himself along; his\nleg was inert, and he could no longer make use of one arm. Edmond was\nobliged to assist him, for otherwise he would not have been able to\nenter by the small aperture which led to Dantès’ chamber.\n\n“Here I am, pursuing you remorselessly,” he said with a benignant\nsmile. “You thought to escape my munificence, but it is in vain. Listen\nto me.”\n\nEdmond saw there was no escape, and placing the old man on his bed, he\nseated himself on the stool beside him.\n\n“You know,” said the abbé, “that I was the secretary and intimate\nfriend of Cardinal Spada, the last of the princes of that name. I owe\nto this worthy lord all the happiness I ever knew. He was not rich,\nalthough the wealth of his family had passed into a proverb, and I\nheard the phrase very often, ‘As rich as a Spada.’ But he, like public\nrumor, lived on this reputation for wealth; his palace was my paradise.\nI was tutor to his nephews, who are dead; and when he was alone in the\nworld, I tried by absolute devotion to his will, to make up to him all\nhe had done for me during ten years of unremitting kindness. The\ncardinal’s house had no secrets for me. I had often seen my noble\npatron annotating ancient volumes, and eagerly searching amongst dusty\nfamily manuscripts. One day when I was reproaching him for his\nunavailing searches, and deploring the prostration of mind that\nfollowed them, he looked at me, and, smiling bitterly, opened a volume\nrelating to the History of the City "}, {"chunk_id": 71, "text": "inspector; “and the abbé’s plan\nhas not even the merit of originality.”\n\nThen turning to Faria, “I inquired if you are well fed?” said he.\n\n“Swear to me,” replied Faria, “to free me if what I tell you prove\ntrue, and I will stay here while you go to the spot.”\n\n“Are you well fed?” repeated the inspector.\n\n“Monsieur, you run no risk, for, as I told you, I will stay here; so\nthere is no chance of my escaping.”\n\n“You do not reply to my question,” replied the inspector impatiently.\n\n“Nor you to mine,” cried the abbé. “You will not accept my gold; I will\nkeep it for myself.

But the kings of modern\ntimes, restrained by the limits of mere probability, have neither\ncourage nor desire. They fear the ear that hears their orders, and the\neye that scrutinizes their actions. Formerly they believed themselves\nsprung from Jupiter, and shielded by their birth; but nowadays they are\nnot inviolable.\n\nIt has always been against the policy of despotic governments to suffer\nthe victims of their persecutions to reappear. As the Inquisition\nrarely allowed its victims to be seen with their limbs distorted and\ntheir flesh lacerated by torture, so madness is always concealed in its\ncell, from whence, should it depart, it is conveyed to some gloomy\nhospital, where the doctor has no thought for man or mind in the\nmutilated being the jailer delivers to him. The very madness of the\nAbbé Faria, gone mad in prison, condemned him to perpetual captivity.\n\nThe inspector kept his word with Dantès; he examined the register, and\nfound the following note concerning him:\n\n_Edmond Dantès:_\n\nViolent Bonapartist; took an active part in the return from Elba.\n\nThe greatest watchfulness and care to be exercised.\n\nThis note was in a different hand from the rest, which showed that it\nhad been added since his confinement. The inspector could not contend\nagainst this accusation; he simply wrote, _Nothing to be done._\n\nThis visit had infused new vigor into Dantès; he had, till then,\nforgotten the date; but now, with a fragment of plaster, he wrote the\ndate, 30th July, 1816, and made a mark every day, in order not to lose\nhis reckoning again. Days and weeks passed away, then months—Dantès\nstill waited; he at first expected to be freed in a fortnight. This\nfortnight expired, he decided that the inspector would do nothing until\nhis return to Paris, and that he would not reach there until his\ncircuit was finished, he therefore fixed three months; three months\npassed away, then six more. Finally ten months and a half had gone by\nand no favorable change had taken place, and Dantès began to fancy the\ninspector’s visit but a dream, an illusion of the brain.\n\nAt the expiration of a year the governor was transferred; he had\nobtained charge of the fortress at Ham. He took with him several of his\nsubordinates, and amongst them Dantès’ jailer. A new governor arrived;\nit would have been too tedious to acquire the names of the prisoners;\nhe learned their numbers instead. This horrible place contained fifty\ncells; their inhabitants were designated by the numbers of their cell,\nand the unhappy young man was no longer called Edmond Dantès—he was now\nnumber 3"}, {"chunk_id": 108, "text": "\ndetected, and they would undoubtedly have been separated. Thus a new, a\nstronger, and more inexorable barrier was interposed to cut off the\nrealization of their hopes.\n\n“You see,” said the young man, with an air of sorrowful resignation, to\nFaria, “that God deems it right to take from me any claim to merit for\nwhat you call my devotion to you. I have promised to remain forever\nwith you, and now I could not break my promise if I would. The treasure\nwill be no more mine than yours, and neither of us will quit this\nprison. But my real treasure is not that, my dear friend, which awaits\nme beneath the sombre rocks of Monte Cristo, it is your presence, our\nliving together five or six hours a day, in spite of our jailers; it is\nthe rays of intelligence you have elicited from my brain, the languages\nyou have implanted in my memory, and which have taken root there with\nall their philological ramifications. These different sciences that you\nhave made so easy to me by the depth of the knowledge you possess of\nthem, and the clearness of the principles to which you have reduced\nthem—this is my treasure, my beloved friend, and with this you have\nmade me rich and happy. Believe me, and take comfort, this is better\nfor me than tons of gold and cases of diamonds, even were they not as\nproblematical as the clouds we see in the morning floating over the\nsea, which we take for _terra firma_, and which evaporate and vanish as\nwe draw near to them. To have you as long as possible near me, to hear\nyour eloquent speech,—which embellishes my mind, strengthens my soul,\nand makes my whole frame capable of great and terrible things, if I\nshould ever be free,—so fills my whole existence, that the despair to\nwhich I was just on the point of yielding when I knew you, has no\nlonger any hold over me; and this—this is my fortune—not chimerical,\nbut actual. I owe you my real good, my present happiness; and all the\nsovereigns of the earth, even Cæsar Borgia himself, could not deprive\nme of this.”\n\nThus, if not actually happy, yet the days these two unfortunates passed\ntogether went quickly. Faria, who for so long a time had kept silence\nas to the treasure, now perpetually talked of it. As he had prophesied\nwould be the case, he remained paralyzed in the right arm and the left\nleg, and had given up all hope of ever enjoying it himself. But he was\ncontinually thinking over some means of escape for his young companion,\nand anticipating the pleasure he would enjoy. For fear the letter might\nbe some day lost or stolen, he compelled Dantès to learn it by heart;\nand Dantès knew it from the first to the last word. Then he destroyed\nthe second portion, assured that if the first were seized, no one would\nbe able to discover its real meaning. Whole hours sometimes passed\nwhile Faria was giving instructions to Dantès,—instructions which were\nto serve him when he was at liberty. Then, once free, from the day and\nhour and moment when he was so, he could have but one only thought,\nwhich was, to gain Monte Cristo by some means, and remain there alone\nunder some pretext which would arouse no suspicions; and once there, to\nendeavor to find the wonderful caverns, and search in the appointed\nspot,—the appointed spot, be it remembered, being the farthest angle in\nthe second opening.\n\nIn the meanwhile the hours passed, if not rapidly, at least tolerably.\nFaria, as we have said, without having recovered the use of his hand\nand foot, had regained all the clearness of his understanding, and had\ngradually, besides the moral instructions we have detailed, taught his\nyouthful companion the patient and sublime duty of a prisoner, who\nlearns to make something from nothing. They were thus perpetually\nemployed,—Faria, that he might not see himself grow old; Dantès, for\nfear of recalling the almost extinct past which now only floated in his\nmemory like a distant light wandering in the night.

I became alarmed, as any\nprosecution might be attended with serious consequences. I was\ncompelled, at this period, to leave Corsica on an important expedition;\nI reflected for a long time, and with the hope of averting some\nimpending misfortune, I resolved that Benedetto should accompany me.\n\n“I hoped that the active and laborious life of a smuggler, with the\nsevere discipline on board, would have a salutary effect on his\ncharacter, which was now well-nigh, if not quite, corrupt.

You see that I should be a fool to accept your\noffer.’\n\n“The arguments, and his audacity, perfectly stupefied me. Benedetto\nrejoined his associates, and I saw him from a distance point me out to\nthem as a fool.”\n\n“Sweet child,” murmured Monte Cristo.\n\n“Oh, had he been my own son,” replied Bertuccio, “or even my nephew, I\nwould have brought him back to the right road, for the knowledge that\nyou are doing your duty gives you strength, but the idea that I was\nstriking a child whose father I had killed, made it impossible for me\nto punish him.

She\ncut the Tropic of Capricorn, and her prow was headed toward the strait\nof the celebrated geographer. Now and then the low shores of Patagonia\nwere seen, but like an almost invisible line on the horizon. They\nsailed along the coast for more than ten miles, but Paganel's famous\ntelescope gave him only a vague idea of these American shores.\n\nThe vessel soon found herself at the head of the strait, and entered\nwithout hesitation. This way is generally preferred by steam-vessels\nbound for the Pacific. Its exact length is three hundred and\nseventy-six miles. Ships of the greatest tonnage can always find deep\nwater, even near its shores, an excellent bottom, and many springs of\nwater. The rivers abound in fish, the forest in game, there are safe\nand easy landings at twenty places, and, in short, a thousand resources\nthat are wanting in the Strait of Lemaire, and off the terrible rocks\nof Cape Horn, which are continually visited by storms and tempests.\n\n[Illustration: Sometimes the tips of her yards would graze the branches\nof the beeches that hung over the waves.]\n\nDuring the first hours of the passage, till you reach Cape Gregory,\nthe shores are low and sandy. The entire passage lasted scarcely\nthirty-six hours, and this moving panorama of the two shores well\nrewarded the pains the geographer took to admire it under the radiant\nbeams of the southern sun. No inhabitant appeared on the shores of the\ncontinent; and only a few Fuegians wandered along the barren rocks of\nTerra del Fuego.\n\nAt one moment the Duncan rounded the peninsula of Brunswick between\ntwo magnificent sights. Just here the strait cuts between stupendous\nmasses of granite. The base of the mountains was hidden in the heart\nof immense forests, while their summits, whitened with eternal snow,\nwere lost in the clouds. Towards the southeast Mount Taru towered\nsix thousand five hundred feet aloft. Night came, preceded by a long\ntwilight, the light melting away insensibly by gentle degrees, while\nthe sky was studded with brilliant stars.\n\nIn the midst of this partial obscurity, the yacht boldly continued on\nher course, without casting anchor in the safe bays with which the\nshores abound. Sometimes the tips of her yards would graze the branches\nof the beeches that hung over the waves. At others her propeller would\nbeat the waters of the great rivers, starting geese, ducks, snipe,\nteal, and all the feathered tribes of the marshes. Soon deserted ruins\nappeared, and fallen monuments, to which the night lent a grand aspect;\nthese were the mournful remains of an abandoned colony, whose name\nwill be an eternal contradiction to the fertility of the coasts and\nthe rich game of the forests. It was Port Famine, the place that the\nSpaniard Sarmiento colonized in 1581 with four hundred emigrants. Here\nhe founded the city of San Felipe. But the extreme severity of the cold\nweakened the colony; famine devoured those whom the winter had spared,\nand in 1587 the explorer Cavendish found the last of these four hundred\nunfortunates dying of hunger amid the ruins of a city only six years in\nexistence.\n\n[Sidenote: CHEERLESS MEMORIES.]\n\nThe vessel coasted along these deserted shores. At daybreak she sailed\nin the midst of the narrow passes, between beeches, ash-trees, and\nbirches, from the bosom of which emerged ivy-clad domes, cupolas\ntapestried with the hardy holly, and lofty spires, among which the\nobelisk of Buckland rose to a great height. Far out in the sea sported\ndroves of seals and whales of great size, judging by their spouting,\nwhich could be seen at a distance of four miles. At last they doubled\nCape Froward, still bristling with the ices of winter. On the other\nside of the strait, on Terra del Fuego, rose Mount Sarmiento to the\nheight of six thousand feet, an enormous mass of rock broken by bands\nof clouds which formed as it were an aerial archipelago in the sky.\n\n[Illustration"}, {"chunk_id": 107, "text": "erritory, the geographer could rightly\nmaintain that the latitude of the document referred to the place of\ncaptivity,--not to the scene of the shipwreck. Indeed, the great rivers\nof the Pampas and their numerous affluents could easily bear the\ndocument to the sea. In this part of Australia, on the contrary, few\nstreams cross the thirty-seventh parallel, and the principal Australian\nrivers--the Murray, the Yara, the Torrens, and the Darling--either flow\ninto each other, or empty into the ocean by mouths where navigation\nis active. What probability was there, then, that a fragile bottle\ncould have descended these continually navigated waters, and reached\nthe Indian Ocean? This consideration could not escape such sagacious\nminds. Paganel's supposition, plausible in Patagonia, was illogical\nin Australia. The geographer perceived this in a discussion on the\nsubject with the major. It was clear that the latitude applied only to\nthe place of shipwreck, and that consequently the bottle had been cast\ninto the sea where the Britannia was wrecked,--on the western coast of\nAustralia.\n\nHowever, as Glenarvan justly observed, this interpretation did not\npreclude the possibility of Captain Grant's captivity, who, moreover,\nhad intimated as much by the words \"where they will be prisoners of the\ncruel Indians.\" But there was no more reason for seeking the prisoners\non the thirty-seventh parallel than on any other.\n\nThis conclusion, after much discussion, was finally accepted, and it\nwas decided that, if no traces of the Britannia were found at Cape\nBernouilli, Lord Glenarvan should return to Europe, relinquishing all\nhope of finding the object of their search.\n\nThis resolution occasioned profound grief to the children of the lost\ncaptain. As the boats containing the whole of the party were rowed\nashore, they felt that the fate of their father would soon be probably\ndecided; irrevocably, we may say, for Paganel, in a former discussion,\nhad clearly demonstrated that the shipwrecked seamen would have reached\ntheir country long ago, if their vessel had stranded on the other, the\neastern coast.\n\n[Sidenote: A NEW PROSPECT.]\n\n\"Hope! hope! never cease to hope!\" said Lady Helena to the young girl\nseated beside her, as they approached the shore. \"The hand of God will\nnever fail us.\"\n\n[Illustration: As the boats containing the whole of the party were\nrowed ashore, they felt that the fate of their father would soon be\nprobably decided.]\n\n\"Yes, Miss Mary,\" said the captain; \"when men have exhausted human\nresources, then Heaven interposes, and, by some unforeseen event, opens\nto them new ways.\"\n\n\"God grant it, captain!\" replied Mary.\n\nThe shore was now only a cable's length distant. The cape terminated in\ngentle declivities extending far out into the sea. The boat entered a\nsmall creek, between banks of coral in process of formation, which in\ntime would form a chain of reefs along the southern coast of the island.\n\nThe passengers of the Duncan disembarked on a perfectly barren shore.\nSteep cliffs formed a lofty sea-wall, and it would have been difficult\nto scale this natural rampart without ladders or cramping-irons.\nFortunately, the captain discovered a breach half a mile southward,\ncaused by a partial crumbling of the cliffs. Probably the sea, during\nviolent equinoctial storms, had beaten against this fragile barrier,\nand thus caused the fall of the upper portions of the mass.\n\nGlenarvan and his companions entered this opening, and reached the\nsummit of the cliffs by a very steep ascent. Robert climbed an abrupt\ndeclivity with the agility of a cat, and arrived first at the top,\nto the great chagrin of Paganel, who was quite mortified at seeing\nhimself outstripped by a mere lad of twelve. However, he distanced the\npeaceable major; but that worthy was utterly indifferent to his defeat.\n\nThe little party surveyed the plain that stretched out beneath them.\nIt was a vast, uncultivated tract, covered with bushes and brushwood,\nand was compared by Glenarvan to th"}, {"chunk_id": 60, "text": "dst of this desert, and, that he might not outstrip them, he\nforced Thaouka to lessen his speed. It was not, however, without much\nresistance, prancing and neighing, that Thalcave's horse consented to\nkeep pace with the others. It was not so much the strength as the voice\nof his master which restrained him; the Indian actually talked to his\nhorse; and the animal, if he did not answer, at least comprehended\nhim. The Patagonian must have used excellent arguments, for, after\n\"discussing\" some time, Thaouka yielded, and obeyed his master's\ncommands.\n\n[Sidenote: GAINED AT LAST.]\n\nBut, if Thaouka understood Thalcave, Thalcave had none the less\nunderstood Thaouka. The intelligent animal, through his superior\ninstincts, had perceived a moisture in the air. He inhaled it eagerly,\nand kept moving his tongue, as if it were steeped in a grateful liquid.\nThe Patagonian could not be deceived; water was not far distant.\n\nHe therefore encouraged his companions by explaining the impatience of\nhis horse, which the others were not long in understanding. They made a\nfinal effort, and galloped after the Indian.\n\nAbout three o'clock a bright line appeared in a hollow of the plain. It\ntrembled under the rays of the sun.\n\n\"Water!\" cried Glenarvan.\n\n\"Water, yes, water!\" cried Robert.\n\nThey had no more need to urge their horses. The poor beasts, feeling\ntheir strength renewed, rushed forward with an irresistible eagerness.\nIn a few moments they had reached the Guamini River, and, saddled as\nthey were, plunged to their breasts into the cooling stream. Their\nmasters imitated their example, without reluctance, and took an\nafternoon bath which was as healthful as it was pleasant.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Ah, how good it is!\" said Robert, as he quenched his thirst in the\nmiddle of the river.\n\n\"Be moderate, my boy,\" said Glenarvan, who did not set a good example.\n\nNothing was heard but the sound of rapid drinking. As for Thalcave,\nhe drank quietly, without hurrying, long and deeply, till they might\nperhaps fear that the stream would be drained.\n\n\"Well,\" said Glenarvan, \"our friends will not be disappointed in their\nexpectations. They are sure, on arriving at the Guamini, to find an\nabundance of clear water, if Thalcave leaves any!\"\n\n\"But could we not go to meet them?\" asked Robert. \"We could spare them\nseveral hours of anxiety.\"\n\n\"Doubtless, my boy; but how carry the water? Wilson has charge of the\nwater-bottles. No, it is better to wait, as we agreed. Calculating the\nnecessary time, and the slow pace of the horses, our friends will be\nhere at night. Let us, then, prepare them a safe shelter and a good\nrepast.\"\n\nThalcave had not waited for Glenarvan's orders to search for a place\nto encamp. He had very fortunately found on the banks of the river a\n\"ramada,\" a kind of inclosure designed for a cattle-fold and shut in\non three sides. The situation was excellent for the purpose, so long\nas one did not fear to sleep in the open air; and that was the least\nanxiety of Thalcave's companions. Thus they did not seek a better\nretreat, but stretched themselves on the ground in the sun to dry their\nwater-soaked garments.\n\n\"Well, since here is shelter,\" said Glenarvan, \"let us think of supper.\nOur friends must be satisfied with the couriers whom they have sent\nforward; and, if I am not greatly mistaken, they will have no reason\nto complain. I think an hour's hunting will not be time lost. Are you\nready, Robert?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord,\" replied he, with gun in hand.\n\n[Sidenote: AN EVENING'S SPORT.]\n\nGlenarvan had conceived this idea because the banks of the Guamini\nseemed to be the haunt of the game of the surrounding plains.\n\"Tinamous,\" a kind of partridge, plovers called \"teru-teru,\" yellow\nrails, and water-fowl of magnificent green were seen rising in flocks.\nAs for quadrupeds, they did not make their appearance; but Thalcave,\npointing to the tall grass and thick coppice, explained that they\nwere hidden there. The hunters had only to take a few steps to find\nthemselves in one of the "}, {"chunk_id": 85, "text": "e shot, and\nstarted.\n\n\"Do not go far,\" said the major, gravely, to the two huntsmen.\n\nAfter their departure Glenarvan and MacNabb went to consult the notches\non the tree, while Wilson and Mulready revived the smouldering embers.\n\nArriving at the surface of this immense lake, they saw no sign of\nabatement. The waters seemed to have attained their highest elevation;\nbut the violence with which they rolled from south to north proved that\nthe equilibrium of the Argentine rivers was not yet established. Before\nthe liquid mass could lower, it must first become calm, like the sea\nwhen flood-tide ends and ebb begins. They could not, therefore, expect\na subsidence of the waters so long as they flowed towards the north\nwith such swiftness.\n\nWhile Glenarvan and the major were making these observations, reports\nresounded in the tree, accompanied by cries of joy almost as noisy.\nThe clear treble of Robert contrasted sharply with the deep bass of\nPaganel, and the strife was which should be the most boyish. The hunt\npromised well, and gave hopes of culinary wonders.\n\nWhen the major and Glenarvan returned to the fire, they had to\ncongratulate Wilson upon an excellent idea. The honest sailor had\ndevoted himself to fishing with wonderful success, with the aid of\na pin and a piece of string. Several dozen of little fish, delicate\nas smelts, called \"mojarras,\" wriggled in a fold of his poncho, and\nseemed likely to make an exquisite dish.\n\nAt this moment the hunters descended from the top of the tree. Paganel\ncarefully carried some black swallows' eggs and a string of sparrows,\nwhich he meant afterwards to serve up as larks. Robert had adroitly\nbrought down several pairs of \"hilgueros,\"--little green-and-yellow\nbirds, which are excellent eating, and very much in demand in the\nMontevideo market. The geographer, who knew many ways of preparing\neggs, had to confine himself this time to cooking them in the hot\nashes. However, the repast was as varied as it was delicate. The dried\nmeat, the hard eggs, the broiled mojarras, and the roast sparrows and\nhilgueros, formed a repast which was long remembered.\n\nThe conversation was very animated. Paganel was greatly complimented in\nhis twofold capacity of hunter and cook, and accepted these encomiums\nwith the modesty that belongs to true merit. Then he gave himself up to\nsingular observations on the magnificent tree that sheltered them with\nits foliage, and whose extent, as he declared, was immense.\n\n\"Robert and I,\" said he jokingly, \"imagined ourselves in the open\nforest during the hunt. One moment I thought we should be lost. I could\nnot find my way. The sun was declining towards the horizon. I sought\nin vain to retrace my steps. Hunger made itself felt acutely. Already\nthe gloomy coppices were resounding with the growls of ferocious\nbeasts,--but no, there are no ferocious beasts, and I am sorry.\"\n\n\"What!\" cried Glenarvan, \"you are sorry there are no ferocious beasts?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"But, when you have everything to fear from their ferocity----\"\n\n\"Ferocity does not exist,--scientifically speaking,\" replied the\ngeographer.\n\n[Illustration: However, the repast was as varied as it was delicate.\nThe dried meat, the hard eggs, the broiled mojarras, and the roast\nsparrows and hilgueros, formed a repast which was long remembered.]\n\n\"Ha! this time, Paganel,\" said the major, \"you will not make me admit\nthe utility of ferocious beasts. What are they good for?\"\n\n\"Major,\" cried Paganel, \"they are good to form classifications, orders,\nfamilies, genera, sub-genera, species----\"\n\n\"Very fine!\" said MacNabb. \"I should not have thought of that! If I\nhad been one of Noah's companions at the time of the deluge, I should\ncertainly have prevented that imprudent patriarch from putting into\nthe ark pairs of tigers, lions, bears, panthers, and other animals as\ndestructive as they were useless.\"\n\n\"Should you have done so?\" inquired Paganel.\n\n\"I should.\"\n\n\"Well, you would have been wrong in a zoological point of view.\"\n\n\"But not in a "}, {"chunk_id": 95, "text": "el, the major, Tom Austin, and the two sailors\nbade an affectionate adieu to the noble Patagonian, who clasped each\none in succession to his broad breast. All were sincerely sorry at\nparting with so courageous and devoted a friend. Paganel forced him\nto accept a map of South America and the two oceans, which the\nIndian had frequently examined with interest. It was the geographer's\nmost precious possession. As for Robert, he had nothing to give but\ncaresses, which he freely lavished upon his deliverer and upon Thaouka.\n\n[Illustration: They pushed off, and the boat was rapidly borne from the\nshore by the ebbing tide. For a long time the motionless outline of the\nIndian was seen through the foam of the waves.]\n\nAt that instant the Duncan's boat approached, and, gliding into the\nnarrow channel between the sand-banks, grounded on the beach.\n\n\"My wife?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"My sister?\" cried Robert.\n\n\"Lady Helena and Miss Grant await you on board,\" replied the cockswain.\n\"But we have not a moment to lose, my lord, for the tide is beginning\nto ebb.\"\n\nThe last acknowledgments were given, and Thalcave accompanied his\nfriends to the boat. Just as Robert was about to embark, the Indian\ntook him in his arms and gazed at him tenderly.\n\n\"Now go,\" said he; \"you are a man!\"\n\n\"Adieu, my friend, adieu!\" cried Glenarvan.\n\n\"Shall we ever see each other again?\" asked Paganel.\n\n\"Who knows?\" replied Thalcave, raising his arms towards heaven.\n\nThey pushed off, and the boat was rapidly borne from the shore by the\nebbing tide. For a long time the motionless outline of the Indian was\nseen through the foam of the waves. Then his tall form grew indistinct,\nand soon became invisible. An hour afterwards they reached the Duncan.\nRobert was the first to spring upon the deck, where he threw himself\nupon his sister's neck, while the crew of the yacht filled the air with\ntheir joyous shouts.\n\nThus had our travelers accomplished the journey across South America\non a rigorously straight line. Neither mountains nor rivers had turned\nthem aside from their course; and, although they were not forced to\nstruggle against the evil designs of men, the relentless fury of the\nelements had often tested their generous intrepidity to its utmost\npowers of endurance.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII.\n\nA NEW DESTINATION.\n\n\nThe first moments were consecrated to the happiness of meeting.\nLord Glenarvan did not wish the joy in the hearts of his friends to\nbe chilled by tidings of their want of success. His first words,\ntherefore, were,--\n\n\"Courage, my friends, courage! Captain Grant is not with us, but we are\nsure to find him.\"\n\nIt needed only such an assurance to restore hope to the passengers of\nthe Duncan. Lady Helena and Mary Grant, while the boat was approaching\nthe ship, had experienced all the anguish of suspense. From the deck\nthey endeavored to count those who were returning. At one time the\nyoung girl would despair; at another she would think she saw her\nfather. Her heart beat quickly; she could not speak; she could scarcely\nstand. Lady Helena supported her, while Captain Mangles stood beside\nher in silence. His keen eyes, accustomed to distinguish distant\nobjects, could not discern the captain.\n\n\"He is there! he is coming! my father!\" murmured the young girl.\n\nBut as the boat gradually drew near, the illusion vanished. Not only\nLady Helena and the captain, but Mary Grant, had now lost all hope. It\nwas, therefore, time for Glenarvan to utter his assuring words.\n\n[Sidenote: \"BREAKFAST!\"]\n\nAfter the first embraces, all were informed of the principal incidents\nof the journey; and, first of all, Glenarvan made known the new\ninterpretation of the document, due to the sagacity of Jacques Paganel.\nHe also praised Robert, of whom his sister had a right to be proud.\nHis courage, his devotion, and the dangers that he had overcome, were\nconspicuously set forth by his noble friend, so that the boy would not\nhave known where to hide himself, if his sister's arms had not afforded\nhim a sure refuge.\n\n[Il"}]}

Who will go for wood in the forest?\"\n\n\"I!\" cried Robert, and, followed by his friend Wilson, he disappeared\nlike a cat in the depths of the foliage.\n\n[Sidenote: GOING BIRD'S-NESTING.]\n\nDuring their absence Paganel found dry moss in sufficient quantity; he\navailed himself of a ray of sunlight, which was easy, for the orb of\nday now shone with a vivid brightness, and then, with the aid of his\nlens, he kindled without difficulty the combustible materials which\nwere laid on a bed of leaves in the fork of the branches. It was a\nnatural fireplace, with no danger of conflagration.\n\nWilson and Robert soon returned with an armful of dead wood, which was\ncast on the fire. Paganel, to cause a draught, placed himself above the\nfireplace, his long legs crossed in the Arab fashion; then, moving his\nbody rapidly up and down, he produced, by means of his poncho, a strong\ncurrent of air. The wood kindled, and a bright, roaring flame soon rose\nfrom this improvised oven. Each dried himself in his own way, while the\nponchos, hung on the branches, swung to and fro in the breeze.\n\nThey now breakfasted, sparingly however, for they had to allow for the\nfollowing day. The immense basin might not perhaps be empty so soon as\nGlenarvan hoped, and, moreover, the provisions were limited. The tree\nbore no fruit; but fortunately it afforded a remarkable supply of fresh\neggs, thanks to the numerous nests that loaded the branches, not to\nspeak of their feathered occupants. These resources were by no means to\nbe despised. The question now was, therefore, in case of a prolonged\nstay, how to secure comfortable quarters.\n\n\"Since the kitchen and dining-room are on the ground floor,\" said\nPaganel, \"we will sleep in the first story. The house is large, the\nrent reasonable, and we must take our ease. I perceive that above there\nare natural cradles, in which, when we have once laid ourselves, we\nshall sleep as well as in the best beds in the world. We have nothing\nto fear; moreover, we will keep watch, and there are enough of us to\nrepulse all the wild animals.\"\n\n\"Only we have no arms,\" said Tom Austin.\n\n\"I have my revolvers,\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\"And I mine,\" replied Robert.\n\n\"What use,\" continued Tom Austin, \"if Mr. Paganel does not find the\nmeans of manufacturing powder?\"\n\n\"It is not necessary,\" replied MacNabb, showing a full flask.\n\n\"Where did you get that, major?\" inquired Paganel.\n\n\"Of Thalcave.

There was, besides, a sort of fireplace with a\nflue of bricks very poorly laid, which enabled them to kindle a fire,\nand thus withstand the external temperature.\n\n\"Here is a shelter, at least,\" said Glenarvan, \"even if it is not\ncomfortable. Providence has led us hither, and we cannot do better than\naccept this fortune.\"\n\n\"Why,\" replied Paganel, \"it is a palace. It only wants sentries and\ncourtiers.

It was six o'clock\nin the evening. The cold was keen and cutting, in spite of the calmness\nof the air. The azure of the sky was already fading, and the sun\nshedding his last rays on the lofty peaks of the mountains.\n\nReaching a hillock of porphyry, they scanned the horizon in every\ndirection. They had now gained the summit of the Andes, which commanded\nan extended prospect. To the east the sides of the mountains declined\nby gentle gradations, down which they could see the peons sliding\nseveral hundred feet below. In the distance extended long lines of\nscattered rocks and stones that had been crowded back by glacial\navalanches. The valley of the Colorado was already growing dim in the\nincreasing twilight; the elevations of land, the crags and the peaks,\nillumined by the rays of the sun, gradually faded, and darkness covered\nthe whole eastern slope of the Andes.\n\nTowards the north undulated a succession of ridges that mingled\ntogether insensibly. To the south, however, the view was magnificent;\nand, as night descended, the grandeur was inimitable. Looking down\ninto the wild valley of Torbido, you saw Mount Antuco, whose yawning\ncrater was two miles distant. The volcano, like some enormous monster,\nbelched forth glowing smoke mingled with torrents of bright flame. The\ncircle of the mountains that inclosed it seemed to be on fire. Showers\nof incandescent stones, clouds of reddish vapors, and streams of lava,\nunited in glittering columns. A loud rumbling that increased every\nmoment, and was followed by a dazzling flash, filled this vast circuit\nwith its sharp reverberations, while the sun, his light gradually\nfading, disappeared as a star is extinguished in the shadows of the\nhorizon.\n\n[Sidenote: FOOD BROUGHT TO THE DOOR.]\n\nPaganel and Glenarvan would have remained a long time to contemplate\nthis magnificent struggle of the fires of earth with those of heaven,\nand the improvised wood-cutters were becoming admirers of nature; but\nWilson, less enthusiastic, reminded them of their situation. Wood was\nwanting, it is true, but fortunately a scanty and dry moss clothed the\nrocks. An ample supply was taken, as well as of a plant whose roots\nwere quite combustible. This precious fuel was brought to the hut, and\npiled in the fire-place; but it was difficult to kindle the fire, and\nespecially to keep it burning.\n\nWhen the viands were prepared, each one drank several mouthfuls of\nhot coffee with delight. As for the dried meat, it appeared a little\nunsatisfactory, which provoked"}, {"chunk_id": 142, "text": " brandy, and\nwhisky of his tavern, and scarcely ever saw any one but squatters or\nherdsmen.\n\nHe replied in an ill-humored way to the questions that were addressed\nhim; but his answers sufficed to determine Ayrton upon his course.\nGlenarvan, however, remunerated the tavern-keeper for the little\ntrouble they had given him, and was about to leave the inn, when a\nplacard, affixed to the wall, attracted his attention. It was a notice\nof the colonial police, detailing the escape of the convicts from\nPerth, and setting a price upon the head of Ben Joyce--a hundred pounds\nsterling to any one who should deliver him up.\n\n\"Indeed,\" said Glenarvan, \"that is a rascal worth hanging.\"\n\n\"And especially worth taking,\" replied Ayrton. \"A hundred pounds! What\na sum! He is not worth it.\"\n\n\"As for the inn-keeper,\" added Glenarvan, as he left the room, \"I\nscarcely put faith in him, despite his placard.\"\n\n\"Nor I either,\" said Ayrton.\n\nGlenarvan and the quartermaster rejoined the party, and they all\nproceeded to where a narrow pass wound across the chain. Here they\nbegan the ascent.\n\n[Sidenote: ANOTHER DEATH.]\n\nBut it was an arduous task. More than once the ladies and their\ncompanions had to dismount, and it was often necessary to push the\nwheels of the heavy vehicle at some steep ascent, or to hold it\nback along the edge of some dangerous precipice. The oxen, as they\ncould not work to advantage at sudden turns, had frequently to be\nunyoked, and the cart blocked to prevent it from sliding back. Ayrton\nwas repeatedly forced to bring the already exhausted horses to his\nassistance.\n\nWhether this exertion was too prolonged, or whether from some other\ncause, one of the horses gave out during the ascent. He fell suddenly,\nwithout an instant's warning. It was Mulready's horse; and when the\nsailor attempted to help him up, he found that he was dead. Ayrton\nexamined the animal carefully, but did not seem to understand the cause\nof this sudden death.\n\n\"The beast must have burst a blood-vessel,\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\"Evidently,\" replied Ayrton.\n\n\"Take my horse, Mulready,\" added Glenarvan; \"I will join Lady Helena in\nthe cart.\"\n\nMulready obeyed, and the little party continued their fatiguing ascent,\nabandoning the body to the crows.\n\nThe next day they began the descent, which was much more rapid. During\nits course a violent hail-storm burst on them, and they were forced to\nseek a shelter beneath the rocks. Not hailstones, but pieces of ice as\nlarge as one's hand, were precipitated from the angry clouds. A sling\ncould not have hurled them with greater force, and several sharp blows\nwarned Paganel and Robert to be on their guard. The cart was pierced\nthrough in many places: indeed, few roofs could have resisted the fall\nof these cutting missiles, some of which froze to the trunks of the\ntrees. It was necessary to wait for the end of this avalanche, for fear\nof being stoned to death, and it was an hour before the party regained\nthe steep path, still slippery with icy incrustations. At evening the\ncart, considerably shattered, but still firm on its wooden wheels,\ndescended the last slopes of the Alps, between tall solitary pines, and\nreached the plains of Gippsland.\n\n[Illustration: Not hailstones, but pieces of ice as large as one's\nhand, were precipitated from the angry clouds.]\n\n[Sidenote: DIVIDED COUNSELS.]\n\nAll were impatient to gain their destination, the Pacific Ocean,\nwhere the Britannia had been wrecked. There only could traces of the\nshipwrecked seamen be found, and not in these desert regions. Ayrton\nurged Lord Glenarvan to send an order to the Duncan to repair to the\ncoast, that he might have at his disposal all the aid possible in his\nsearch. In his opinion they ought to take advantage of the Lucknow\nroad, which would lead them to Melbourne. Afterwards this might be\ndifficult, for highways leading directly to the capital would be\nabsolutely wanting.\n\nThis advice of the quartermaster seemed reasonable. Paganel seconded\nit. He thought, too, that the yacht woul"}, {"chunk_id": 179, "text": "ic.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVII.\n\nA DREADED COUNTRY.\n\n\nWhat Paganel had stated was indisputable. The cruelty of the New\nZealanders could not be doubted. There was, therefore, danger in\nlanding. But if the danger had been a hundred times greater, it must\nhave been faced. Captain Mangles felt the necessity of leaving this\nvessel, which would soon break up. Between two perils, one certain, the\nother only probable, there was no possible hesitation.\n\n[Sidenote: ANOTHER CHANGE OF RESIDENCE.]\n\nAs for the chance of being picked up by some passing ship, they could\nnot reasonably rely upon it, for the Macquarie was out of the course\nusually taken in going to New Zealand. The shipwreck had happened on\nthe desert shores of Ika-Na-Maoui.\n\n\"When shall we start?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"To-morrow morning at ten o'clock,\" replied Captain Mangles. \"The tide\nwill begin to rise then, and will carry us ashore.\"\n\nEarly the next day the raft was finished. The captain had given\nhis entire attention to its construction. They needed a steady and\nmanageable craft, and one capable of resisting the waves for a voyage\nof nine miles. The masts of the brig could alone furnish the necessary\nmaterials.\n\nThe raft was at length completed. It could doubtless sustain the shock\nof the surges; but could it be steered, and the coast be reached, if\nthe wind should veer? This was a question only to be decided by trial.\n\nAt nine o'clock the loading began. The provisions were first put on\nboard in sufficient quantities to last until the arrival at Auckland,\nfor there could be no reliance upon the products of this dreaded\ncountry. Olbinett furnished some preserved meats, the remains of the\nMacquarie's supplies. There was very little, however; and they were\nforced to depend upon the coarse fare of the mess, which consisted of\nvery inferior ship-biscuits and two barrels of salt fish, greatly to\nthe steward's regret.\n\nThese stores were inclosed in sealed cans and then secured to the foot\nof the mast. The arms and ammunition were put in a safe and dry place.\nFortunately, the travelers were well supplied with rifles and revolvers.\n\nA small anchor was taken on board, in case they should reach the shore\nat low tide and be forced to anchor in the offing. Flood-tide soon\nbegan, the breeze blew gently from the northwest, and a slight swell\nagitated the surface of the sea.\n\n\"Are we ready?\" asked Captain Mangles.\n\n\"All is ready, captain,\" replied Wilson.\n\n\"Aboard, then!\"\n\nLady Helena and Mary Grant descended the ship's side by a clumsy\nrope-ladder, and took their seats at the foot of the mast near the\ncases of provisions, their companions around them. Wilson took the\nhelm, the captain stationed himself at the sail-tackling, and Mulready\ncut the cable that confined the raft to the brig. The sail was spread,\nand they began to move towards the shore under the combined influence\nof wind and tide.\n\nThe coast was only nine miles distant,--not a difficult voyage for a\nwell-manned boat; but with the raft it was necessary to advance slowly.\nIf the wind held out, they might perhaps reach land with this tide; but\nif there should be a calm, the ebb would carry them back, or they would\nbe compelled to anchor and wait for the next tide.\n\nHowever, Captain Mangles hoped to succeed. The wind freshened. As it\nhad been flood now for some hours, they must either reach land soon, or\nanchor.\n\nFortune favored them. Gradually the black points of the rocks and\nthe yellow sand of the bars disappeared beneath the waves; but great\nattention and extreme skill became necessary, in this dangerous\nneighborhood, to guide their unwieldy craft.\n\nThey were still five miles from shore. A clear sky enabled them to\ndistinguish the principal features of the country. To the northeast\nrose a lofty mountain, whose outline was defined against the horizon in\na very singular resemblance to the grinning profile of a monkey.\n\nPaganel soon observed that all the sand-bars had disappeared.\n\n\"Except one,\" replied Lady Helena.\n\n\"Where?\" asked Pagane"}, {"chunk_id": 209, "text": "moving. They dug a sort of\ngroove for it down the side of the mountain, that it might slide on an\ninclined plane.\n\nAs their action increased, the trembling of the earth became more\nviolent. Hollow rumblings and hissings sounded under the thin\ncrust. But the bold experimenters, like real Vulcans, governing the\nunderground fires, worked on in silence. Several cracks and a few gusts\nof hot smoke warned them that their position was becoming dangerous.\nBut a final effort detached the block, which glided down the slope of\nthe mountain and disappeared.\n\nThe thin covering at once yielded. An incandescent column poured forth\ntowards the sky with loud explosions, while streams of boiling water\nand lava rolled towards the encampment of the natives and the valleys\nbelow. The whole peak trembled, and you might almost have thought that\nit was disappearing in a general conflagration.\n\nGlenarvan and his companions had scarcely time to escape the shock of\nthe eruption. They fled to the inclosure of the tomb, but not without\nreceiving a few scalding drops of the water, which bubbled and exhaled\na strong sulphureous odor.\n\nThen mud, lava, and volcanic fragments mingled in the scene of\ndevastation. Torrents of flame furrowed the sides of the Maunganamu.\nThe adjoining mountains glowed in the light of the eruption, and the\ndeep valleys were illumined with a vivid brightness.\n\nThe savages were soon aroused, both by the noise and the heat\nof the lava that flowed in a scalding tide through the midst of\ntheir encampment. Those whom the fiery flood had not reached fled,\nand ascended the surrounding hills, turning and gazing back at\nthis terrific phenomenon, with which their god, in his wrath, had\noverwhelmed the desecrators of the sacred mountain; while at certain\nmoments they were heard howling their consecratory cry:\n\n\"Taboo! taboo! taboo!\"\n\n[Illustration: The fugitives made themselves levers out of the stakes\nof the tomb.]\n\n[Illustration: An incandescent column poured forth towards the sky with\nloud explosions, while streams of boiling water and lava rolled towards\nthe encampment of the natives.]\n\nMeantime an enormous quantity of vapor, melted stones, and lava had\nescaped from the crater. It was no longer a simple geyser. All this\nvolcanic effervescence had hitherto been confined beneath the crust of\nthe peak, since the outlets of Tangariro sufficed for its expansion;\nbut as a new opening had been made, it had rushed forth with extreme\nviolence.\n\nAll night long, during the storm that raged above and below, the peak\nwas shaken with a commotion that could not but alarm Glenarvan. The\nprisoners, concealed behind the palisade of the tomb, watched the\nfearful progress of the outbreak.\n\nMorning came. The fury of the volcano had not moderated. Thick,\nyellowish vapors mingled with the flames, and torrents of lava poured\nin every direction. Glenarvan, with eye alert and beating heart,\nglanced between the interstices of the inclosure, and surveyed the camp\nof the Maoris.\n\nThe natives had fled to the neighboring plateaus, beyond the reach of\nthe volcano. Several corpses, lying at the foot of the peak, had been\ncharred by the fire. Farther on, towards the pah, the lava had consumed\na number of huts, that were still smoking. The savages, in scattered\ngroups, were gazing at the vapory summit of Maunganamu with religious\nawe.\n\nKai-Koumou came into the midst of his warriors, and Glenarvan\nrecognized him. The chief advanced to the base of the peak, on the side\nspared by the eruption, but did not cross the first slopes. Here, with\noutstretched arms, like a sorcerer exorcising, he made a few grimaces,\nthe meaning of which did not escape the prisoners. As Paganel had\nforeseen, Kai-Koumou was invoking upon the mountain a more rigorous\ntaboo.\n\nSoon after, the natives descended, in single file, the winding paths\nthat led towards the pah.\n\n[Sidenote: A WEARY WAITING.]\n\n\"They are going!\" cried Glenarvan. \"They are abandoning their post!\nGod be thanked!

He resolved to keep towards the Cape, that he\nmight deviate as little as possible from his prescribed course. It was,\ntherefore, necessary to brace the sails obliquely to the wind. The\ntop-sail was reefed, a kind of fore-sail rigged on the main-stay, and\nthe helm crowded hard aport. The yacht, which was a stanch and fleet\nvessel, started like a spirited horse that feels the spur, and proudly\nbreasted the angry billows.\n\nThe rest of the night was passed in this situation. They hoped that the\ntempest would abate by break of day. Vain hope! At eight o'clock in the\nmorning it was still blowing hard, and the wind soon became a hurricane.\n\nThe captain said nothing, but he trembled for his vessel and those\nwhom she carried. The Duncan now and then gave a fearful lurch; her\nstanchions cracked, and sometimes the yards of the mainmast struck the\ncrests of the waves. At one moment the crew thought the yacht would\nnot rise again. Already the sailors, hatchet in hand, were rushing\nto cut away the fore-shrouds, when they were violently torn from\ntheir fastenings by the blast. The ship righted herself, but, without\nsupport on the waves, she was tossed about so terribly that the masts\nthreatened to break at their very foundations. She could not long\nendure such rolling; she was growing weak, and soon her shattered sides\nand opening seams must give way for the water.\n\n[Illustration: Then, impelled by the hurricane, the billows outran\nher; they leaped over the taffrail, and the whole deck was swept with\ntremendous violence.]\n\n[Sidenote: NEARING THE END.]\n\nCaptain Mangles had but one resource,--to rig a storm-jib. He succeeded\nafter several hours' labor, but it was not until three o'clock in the\nafternoon that the jib was hauled to the main-stay and set to the\nwind. With this piece of canvas the Duncan flew before the wind\nwith inconceivable rapidity. It was necessary to keep up the greatest\npossible speed, for upon this alone depended her safety. Sometimes,\noutstripping the waves, she cut them with her slender prow and plunged\nbeneath them, like an enormous sea-monster, while the water swept\nher deck from stem to stern. At other times her swiftness barely\nequaled that of the surges, her rudder lost all power, and she gave\nterrific lurches that threatened to capsize her. Then, impelled by the\nhurricane, the billows outran her; they leaped over the taffrail, and\nthe whole deck was swept with tremendous violence.\n\nThe situation was indeed alarming. The captain would not leave his\npost for an instant. He was tortured by fears that his impassive face\nwould not betray, and persistently sought to penetrate with his gaze\nthe gathering gloom. And he had good cause for fear. The Duncan, driven\nout of her course, was running towards the Australian coast with a\nswiftness that nothing could arrest. He felt, too, as if by instinct,\nthat a strong current was drawing him along. At every moment he feared\nthe shock of a reef upon which the yacht would be dashed into a\nthousand pieces, and he calculated that the shore was not more than a\ndozen miles to leeward.\n\nFinally he went in search of Lord Glenarvan, consulted with him in\nprivate, explained their actual situation, viewed it with the coolness\nof a sailor who is ready for any emergency, and ended by saying that he\nshould be obliged perhaps to run the Duncan ashore.\n\n\"To save those she carries, if possible, my lord,\" he added.\n\n\"Very well, captain,\" replied Glenarvan.\n\n\"And Lady Helena and Miss Grant?\"\n\n\"I will inform them only at the last moment, when all hope is gone of\nkeeping at sea. You will tell me.\"\n\n\"I will, my lord.\"\n\nGlenarvan returned to the ladies, who, without knowing all the danger,\nfelt it to be imminent. They displayed, however, a noble courage, equal\nat least to that of their companions. Paganel gave himself up to the\nmost unreasonable theories concerning the direction of atmospheric\ncurrents,"}, {"chunk_id": 60, "text": "dst of this desert, and, that he might not outstrip them, he\nforced Thaouka to lessen his speed. It was not, however, without much\nresistance, prancing and neighing, that Thalcave's horse consented to\nkeep pace with the others. It was not so much the strength as the voice\nof his master which restrained him; the Indian actually talked to his\nhorse; and the animal, if he did not answer, at least comprehended\nhim. The Patagonian must have used excellent arguments, for, after\n\"discussing\" some time, Thaouka yielded, and obeyed his master's\ncommands.\n\n[Sidenote: GAINED AT LAST.]\n\nBut, if Thaouka understood Thalcave, Thalcave had none the less\nunderstood Thaouka. The intelligent animal, through his superior\ninstincts, had perceived a moisture in the air. He inhaled it eagerly,\nand kept moving his tongue, as if it were steeped in a grateful liquid.\nThe Patagonian could not be deceived; water was not far distant.\n\nHe therefore encouraged his companions by explaining the impatience of\nhis horse, which the others were not long in understanding. They made a\nfinal effort, and galloped after the Indian.\n\nAbout three o'clock a bright line appeared in a hollow of the plain. It\ntrembled under the rays of the sun.\n\n\"Water!\" cried Glenarvan.\n\n\"Water, yes, water!\" cried Robert.\n\nThey had no more need to urge their horses. The poor beasts, feeling\ntheir strength renewed, rushed forward with an irresistible eagerness.\nIn a few moments they had reached the Guamini River, and, saddled as\nthey were, plunged to their breasts into the cooling stream. Their\nmasters imitated their example, without reluctance, and took an\nafternoon bath which was as healthful as it was pleasant.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Ah, how good it is!\" said Robert, as he quenched his thirst in the\nmiddle of the river.\n\n\"Be moderate, my boy,\" said Glenarvan, who did not set a good example.\n\nNothing was heard but the sound of rapid drinking. As for Thalcave,\nhe drank quietly, without hurrying, long and deeply, till they might\nperhaps fear that the stream would be drained.\n\n\"Well,\" said Glenarvan, \"our friends will not be disappointed in their\nexpectations. They are sure, on arriving at the Guamini, to find an\nabundance of clear water, if Thalcave leaves any!\"\n\n\"But could we not go to meet them?\" asked Robert. \"We could spare them\nseveral hours of anxiety.\"\n\n\"Doubtless, my boy; but how carry the water? Wilson has charge of the\nwater-bottles. No, it is better to wait, as we agreed. Calculating the\nnecessary time, and the slow pace of the horses, our friends will be\nhere at night. Let us, then, prepare them a safe shelter and a good\nrepast.\"\n\nThalcave had not waited for Glenarvan's orders to search for a place\nto encamp. He had very fortunately found on the banks of the river a\n\"ramada,\" a kind of inclosure designed for a cattle-fold and shut in\non three sides. The situation was excellent for the purpose, so long\nas one did not fear to sleep in the open air; and that was the least\nanxiety of Thalcave's companions. Thus they did not seek a better\nretreat, but stretched themselves on the ground in the sun to dry their\nwater-soaked garments.\n\n\"Well, since here is shelter,\" said Glenarvan, \"let us think of supper.\nOur friends must be satisfied with the couriers whom they have sent\nforward; and, if I am not greatly mistaken, they will have no reason\nto complain.

A rope with a slip-noose\nconfined his tail and paralyzed his movements. A few moments afterward\nhe was hauled over the ratlings, and precipitated upon the deck of the\nyacht. One of the sailors at once approached him, not without caution,\nand with a vigorous blow of the hatchet cut off the formidable tail of\nthe animal.\n\nThe chase was ended, and there was nothing more to fear from the\nmonster. The vengeance of the sailors was satisfied, but not their\ncuriosity. Indeed, it is customary on board of every vessel to\ncarefully examine the stomachs of sharks. The men, knowing the\ninordinate voracity of the creature, wait with some anxiety, and their\nexpectation is not always in vain.\n\nLady Glenarvan, not wishing to witness this strange \"exploration,\"\nretired to the cabin. The shark was still panting. He was ten feet\nlong, and weighed more than six hundred pounds. These dimensions are\nnothing extraordinary; for if the balance-fish is not classed among the\ngiants of this species, at least he belongs to the most formidable of\ntheir family.\n\nThe enormous fish was soon cut open by a blow of the hatchet, without\nfurther ceremony. The hook had penetrated to the stomach, which was\nabsolutely empty. Evidently the animal had fasted a long time, and\nthe disappointed seamen were about to cast the remains into the sea,\nwhen the attention of the mate was attracted by a bulky object firmly\nimbedded in the viscera.\n\n\"Ha! what is this?\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"That,\" replied one of the sailors, \"is a piece of rock that the\ncreature has taken in for ballast.\"\n\n\"Good!\" said another; \"it is probably a bullet that this fellow has\nreceived in the stomach, and could not digest.\"\n\n[Illustration: \"Good,\" said Glenarvan; \"wash the dirty thing, and bring\nit into the cabin.\"]\n\n\"Be still, all of you!\" cried Tom Austin, the mate; \"do you not see\nthat the animal was a great drunkard? and to lose nothing, has drank\nnot only the wine, but the bottle too!\"\n\n\"What!\" exclaimed Lord Glenarvan, \"is it a bottle that this shark has\nin his stomach?\"\n\n\"A real bottle!\" replied the mate, \"but you can easily see that it does\nnot come from the wine-cellar.\"\n\n\"Well, Tom,\" said Glenarvan, \"draw it out carefully. Bottles found in\nthe sea frequently contain precious documents.\"\n\n\"Do you think so?\" said Major MacNabb.\n\n\"I do; at least, that it may happen so.\"\n\n\"Oh! I do not contradict you,\" replied the major. \"Perhaps there may be\na secret in this.\"\n\n\"We shall see,\" said Glenarvan. \"Well, Tom?\"\n\n\"Here it is,\" said the mate, displaying the shapeless object that he\nhad just drawn with difficulty from the interior of the shark.\n\n\"Good,\" said Glenarvan; \"wash the dirty thing, and bring it into the\ncabin.\"\n\nTom obeyed; and the bottle found under such singular circumstances was\nplaced on the cabin-table, around which Lord Glenarvan, Major MacNabb,\nand Captain John Mangles took their seats, together with Lady Helena;\nfor a woman, they say, is always a little inquisitive.\n\nEverything causes excitement at sea. For a moment there was silence.\nEach gazed wonderingly at this strange waif. Did it contain the secret\nof a disaster, or only an insignificant message confided to the mercy\nof the waves by some idle navigator?\n\n[Sidenote: \"OLD IN BOTTLE.\"]\n\nHowever, they must know what it was, and Glenarvan, without waiting\nlonger, proceeded to examine the bottle. He took, moreover, all\nnecessary precautions. You would have thought a coroner was pointing\nout the particulars of a suspicious quest. And Glenarvan was right,\nfor the most insignificant mark in appearance may often lead to an\nimportant discovery.\n\nBefore examining it internally, the bottle was inspected externally.\nIt had a slender neck, the mouth of which was protected by an\niron wire considerably rusted. Its sides were very thick, and\ncapable of supporting a pressure of several atmospheres, betraying\nevidently previous connection with champagne. With these "}, {"chunk_id": 183, "text": "y as most of\nPaganel's disquisitions and information concerning these islands, and\nthey were before a late hour exchanged for peaceful though probably\ndreamy slumbers, by his hearers.\n\nEarly the next morning the signal for departure was given. The rain had\nceased during the night, and the sky was covered with grayish clouds,\nwhich intercepted the rays of the sun, so that the temperature thus\nmoderated enabled them to endure the fatigues of the journey.\n\nBy consulting the map, Paganel had calculated that they would have to\ntravel eight days. But, instead of following the windings of the coast,\nhe considered it best to proceed to the village of Ngarnavahia, at the\njunction of the Waikato and Waipa rivers. Here the overland mail-road\npassed, and it would thence be easy to reach Drury, and rest, after\ntheir hardships, in a comfortable hotel.\n\nBut before they left the shore their attention was drawn to the large\nnumber of seals, of a peculiar appearance and genus, which lay on the\nbroad sands daily washed by the tidal water. These seals, with their\nrounded heads, their upturned look, their expressive eyes, presented an\nappearance, almost a physiognomy, that was mild and wellnigh tender,\nand served to recall to the traveler's memory the tales about the\nsirens of the olden and modern times, who served as the enchantresses\nto just such inhospitable shores as that seemed on which they had\nthemselves been cast. These animals, which are very numerous on the\ncoast of New Zealand, are hunted and killed for the sake of their\noil and their skins, and Paganel was of course able to tell how much\nwithin the last few years they had been searched for by the traders and\nnavigators on these seas.\n\n[Illustration: These seals, with rounded heads, upturned look,\nexpressive eyes, presented an appearance, almost a physiognomy, that\nwas mild and wellnigh tender.]\n\n[Illustration: The New Zealand \"kiwi,\" known to naturalists as the\napteryx.]\n\nWhilst speaking of these matters, Robert drew Paganel's attention to\nsome curious amphibious creatures, resembling the seals, but larger,\nwhich were devouring with rapidity the large stones lying on the shore.\n\n\"Look,\" said he, \"here are seals which feed on pebbles.\"\n\nPaganel assured them that these sea-elephants were only weighting\nthemselves preparatory to their descent into the water, and protested\nthat if they would but wait for a time they might see them descend and\nsubsequently return when they had unloaded themselves. The first part\nof this programme they saw accomplished; but, greatly to Paganel's\ngrief, Glenarvan would not longer delay the party, and they soon began\nto see inland beauties and curiosities of another sort.\n\nThe district through which they had to walk this day and the next was\none very thick with brush and under-wood, and there was no possibility\nof horse or vehicle passing or meeting them. They now regretted the\nabsence of their Australian cart, for the height and frequency of\nthe large ferns in the neighborhood prevented their making any rapid\nprogress on foot.\n\n[Sidenote: THE LAST STAGE OF PERIPATETICS.]\n\nHere and there, however, Robert and Paganel would rejoice together\nover some choice bush or bird that they had met with. Notable among\nthe latter was the New Zealand \"kiwi,\" known to naturalists as the\napteryx, and which is becoming very scarce, from the pursuit of its\nmany enemies. Robert discovered in a nest on the ground a couple of\nthese birds without tails or wings, but with four toes on the foot, and\na long beak or bill like that of a woodcock, and small white feathers\nall over its body. Of this bird there was then an entire absence in the\nzoological collections of Europe, and Paganel indulged the hope that he\nmight be able to be the proud contributor of such a valuable specimen\nto the \"Jardin\" of his own city. For the present, at least, the\nrealization of his hopes had to be deferred; and at length, after some\ndays of weariness and continued travel, the party reached the banks\nof the "}, {"chunk_id": 85, "text": "e shot, and\nstarted.\n\n\"Do not go far,\" said the major, gravely, to the two huntsmen.\n\nAfter their departure Glenarvan and MacNabb went to consult the notches\non the tree, while Wilson and Mulready revived the smouldering embers.\n\nArriving at the surface of this immense lake, they saw no sign of\nabatement. The waters seemed to have attained their highest elevation;\nbut the violence with which they rolled from south to north proved that\nthe equilibrium of the Argentine rivers was not yet established. Before\nthe liquid mass could lower, it must first become calm, like the sea\nwhen flood-tide ends and ebb begins. They could not, therefore, expect\na subsidence of the waters so long as they flowed towards the north\nwith such swiftness.\n\nWhile Glenarvan and the major were making these observations, reports\nresounded in the tree, accompanied by cries of joy almost as noisy.\nThe clear treble of Robert contrasted sharply with the deep bass of\nPaganel, and the strife was which should be the most boyish. The hunt\npromised well, and gave hopes of culinary wonders.\n\nWhen the major and Glenarvan returned to the fire, they had to\ncongratulate Wilson upon an excellent idea. The honest sailor had\ndevoted himself to fishing with wonderful success, with the aid of\na pin and a piece of string. Several dozen of little fish, delicate\nas smelts, called \"mojarras,\" wriggled in a fold of his poncho, and\nseemed likely to make an exquisite dish.\n\nAt this moment the hunters descended from the top of the tree. Paganel\ncarefully carried some black swallows' eggs and a string of sparrows,\nwhich he meant afterwards to serve up as larks. Robert had adroitly\nbrought down several pairs of \"hilgueros,\"--little green-and-yellow\nbirds, which are excellent eating, and very much in demand in the\nMontevideo market. The geographer, who knew many ways of preparing\neggs, had to confine himself this time to cooking them in the hot\nashes. However, the repast was as varied as it was delicate. The dried\nmeat, the hard eggs, the broiled mojarras, and the roast sparrows and\nhilgueros, formed a repast which was long remembered.\n\nThe conversation was very animated. Paganel was greatly complimented in\nhis twofold capacity of hunter and cook, and accepted these encomiums\nwith the modesty that belongs to true merit. Then he gave himself up to\nsingular observations on the magnificent tree that sheltered them with\nits foliage, and whose extent, as he declared, was immense.\n\n\"Robert and I,\" said he jokingly, \"imagined ourselves in the open\nforest during the hunt. One moment I thought we should be lost. I could\nnot find my way. The sun was declining towards the horizon. I sought\nin vain to retrace my steps. Hunger made itself felt acutely. Already\nthe gloomy coppices were resounding with the growls of ferocious\nbeasts,--but no, there are no ferocious beasts, and I am sorry.\"\n\n\"What!\" cried Glenarvan, \"you are sorry there are no ferocious beasts?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"But, when you have everything to fear from their ferocity----\"\n\n\"Ferocity does not exist,--scientifically speaking,\" replied the\ngeographer.\n\n[Illustration: However, the repast was as varied as it was delicate.\nThe dried meat, the hard eggs, the broiled mojarras, and the roast\nsparrows and hilgueros, formed a repast which was long remembered.]\n\n\"Ha! this time, Paganel,\" said the major, \"you will not make me admit\nthe utility of ferocious beasts. What are they good for?\"\n\n\"Major,\" cried Paganel, \"they are good to form classifications, orders,\nfamilies, genera, sub-genera, species----\"\n\n\"Very fine!\" said MacNabb. \"I should not have thought of that! If I\nhad been one of Noah's companions at the time of the deluge, I should\ncertainly have prevented that imprudent patriarch from putting into\nthe ark pairs of tigers, lions, bears, panthers, and other animals as\ndestructive as they were useless.\"\n\n\"Should you have done so?\" inquired Paganel.\n\n\"I should.\"\n\n\"Well, you would have been wrong in a zoological point of view.\"\n\n\"But not in a "}]}

He was\ntelling me this morning that, tired of letting his property lie dormant\nin Italy, which is a dead nation, he wished to find a method, either in\nFrance or England, of multiplying his millions, but remember, that\nthough I place great confidence in Busoni, I am not responsible for\nthis.”\n\n“Never mind; accept my thanks for the client you have sent me. It is a\nfine name to inscribe on my ledgers, and my cashier was quite proud of\nit when I explained to him who the Cavalcanti were. By the way, this is\nmerely a simple question, when this sort of people marry their sons, do\nthey give them any fortune?”\n\n“Oh, that depends upon circumstances. I know an Italian prince, rich as\na gold mine, one of the noblest families in Tuscany, who, when his sons\nmarried according to his wish, gave them millions; and when they\nmarried against his consent, merely allowed them thirty crowns a month.\nShould Andrea marry according to his father’s views, he will, perhaps,\ngive him one, two, or three millions. For example, supposing it were\nthe daughter of a banker, he might take an interest in the house of the\nfather-in-law of his son; then again, if he disliked his choice, the\nmajor takes the key, double-locks his coffer, and Master Andrea would\nbe obliged to live like the sons of a Parisian family, by shuffling\ncards or rattling the dice.”\n\n“Ah, that boy will find out some Bavarian or Peruvian princess; he will\nwant a crown, an El Dorado, and Potosí.”\n\n“No; these grand lords on the other side of the Alps frequently marry\ninto plain families; like Jupiter, they like to cross the race. But do\nyou wish to marry Andrea, my dear M. Danglars, that you are asking so\nmany questions?”\n\n“_Ma foi_,” said Danglars, “it would not be a bad speculation, I fancy,\nand you know I am a speculator.”\n\n“You are not thinking of Mademoiselle Danglars, I hope; you would not\nlike poor Andrea to have his throat cut by Albert?”\n\n“Albert,” repeated Danglars, shrugging his shoulders; “ah, well; he\nwould care very little about it, I think.”\n\n“But he is betrothed to your daughter, I believe?”\n\n“Well, M. de Morcerf and I have talked about this marriage, but Madame\nde Morcerf and Albert——”\n\n“You do not mean to say that it would not be a good match?”\n\n“Indeed, I imagine that Mademoiselle Danglars is as good as M. de\nMorcerf.”\n\n“Mademoiselle Danglars’ fortune will be great, no doubt, especially if\nthe telegraph should not make any more mistakes.”\n\n“Oh, I do not mean her fortune only; but tell me——”\n\n“What?”\n\n“Why did you not invite M. and Madame de Morcerf to your dinner?”\n\n“I did so, but he excused himself on account of Madame de Morcerf being\nobliged to go to Dieppe for the benefit of sea air.”\n\n“Yes, yes,” said Danglars, laughing, “it would do her a great deal of\ngood.”\n\n“Why so?”\n\n“Because it is the air she always breathed in her youth.”\n\nMonte Cristo took no notice of this ill-natured remark.\n\n“But still, if Albert be not so rich as Mademoiselle Danglars,” said\nthe count, “you must allow that he has a fine name?”\n\n“So he has; but I like mine as well.”\n\n“Certainly; your name is popular, and does honor to the title they have\nadorned it with; but you are too intelligent not to know that according\nto a prejudice, too firmly rooted"}, {"chunk_id": 86, "text": "en weary with\ntoil, you had your hopes to refresh and encourage you.”\n\n“I assure you,” replied the old man, “I did not turn to that source for\nrecreation or support.”\n\n“What did you do then?”\n\n“I wrote or studied.”\n\n“Were you then permitted the use of pens, ink, and paper?”\n\n“Oh, no,” answered the abbé; “I had none but what I made for myself.”\n\n“You made paper, pens and ink?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nDantès gazed with admiration, but he had some difficulty in believing.\nFaria saw this.\n\n“When you pay me a visit in my cell, my young friend,” said he, “I will\nshow you an entire work, the fruits of the thoughts and reflections of\nmy whole life; many of them meditated over in the shades of the\nColosseum at Rome, at the foot of St. Mark’s column at Venice, and on\nthe borders of the Arno at Florence, little imagining at the time that\nthey would be arranged in order within the walls of the Château d’If.\nThe work I speak of is called _A Treatise on the Possibility of a\nGeneral Monarchy in Italy_, and will make one large quarto volume.”\n\n“And on what have you written all this?”\n\n“On two of my shirts. I invented a preparation that makes linen as\nsmooth and as easy to write on as parchment.”\n\n“You are, then, a chemist?”\n\n“Somewhat; I know Lavoisier, and was the intimate friend of Cabanis.”\n\n“But for such a work you must have needed books—had you any?”\n\n“I had nearly five thousand volumes in my library at Rome; but after\nreading them over many times, I found out that with one hundred and\nfifty well-chosen books a man possesses, if not a complete summary of\nall human knowledge, at least all that a man need really know. I\ndevoted three years of my life to reading and studying these one\nhundred and fifty volumes, till I knew them nearly by heart; so that\nsince I have been in prison, a very slight effort of memory has enabled\nme to recall their contents as readily as though the pages were open\nbefore me. I could recite you the whole of Thucydides, Xenophon,\nPlutarch, Titus Livius, Tacitus, Strada, Jornandes, Dante, Montaigne,\nShakespeare, Spinoza, Machiavelli, and Bossuet. I name only the most\nimportant.”\n\n“You are, doubtless, acquainted with a variety of languages, so as to\nhave been able to read all these?”\n\n“Yes, I speak five of the modern tongues—that is to say, German,\nFrench, Italian, English, and Spanish; by the aid of ancient Greek I\nlearned modern Greek—I don’t speak it so well as I could wish, but I am\nstill trying to improve myself.”\n\n“Improve yourself!” repeated Dantès; “why, how can you manage to do\nso?”\n\n“Why, I made a vocabulary of the words I knew; turned, returned, and\narranged them, so as to enable me to express my thoughts through their\nmedium. I know nearly one thousand words, which is all that is\nabsolutely necessary, although I believe there are nearly one hundred\nthousand in the dictionaries. I cannot hope to be very fluent, but I\ncertainly should have no difficulty in explaining my wants and wishes;\nand that would be quite as much as I should ever require.”\n\nStronger grew the wonder of Dantès, who almost fancied he had to do\nwith one gifted with supernatural powers; still hoping to find some\nimperfection which might bring him down to a level with human beings,\nhe added, “Then if you were not furnished with pens, how did you manage\nto write the work you speak of?”\n\n“I made myself some excellent ones, which would be universally\npreferred to all others if once known. You are aware what huge whitings\nare served to us on _maigre_ days. Well, I selected the cartilages of\nthe heads of these fishes, and you can scarcely imagine the delight\nwith which I welcomed the arrival of each Wednesday, Friday, and\nSaturday, as affording me the means of increasing my stock of pens; for\nI will freely confess that my historical labors have been my greatest\nsolace and relief. While retracing the past, I forget the present; and\ntraversing at will the path of history I cease to remember that I am\nmyself a prisoner.”\n\n“But the ink,” said Dantès; “of what did y"}, {"chunk_id": 107, "text": "e oldest and most powerful families of the fifteenth century; and in\nthose times, when other opportunities for investment were wanting, such\naccumulations of gold and jewels were by no means rare; there are at\nthis day Roman families perishing of hunger, though possessed of nearly\na million in diamonds and jewels, handed down by entail, and which they\ncannot touch.”\n\nEdmond thought he was in a dream—he wavered between incredulity and\njoy.\n\n“I have only kept this secret so long from you,” continued Faria, “that\nI might test your character, and then surprise you. Had we escaped\nbefore my attack of catalepsy, I should have conducted you to Monte\nCristo; now,” he added, with a sigh, “it is you who will conduct me\nthither.

I am no relation of yours.”\n\n“You are my son, Dantès,” exclaimed the old man. “You are the child of\nmy captivity. My profession condemns me to celibacy. God has sent you\nto me to console, at one and the same time, the man who could not be a\nfather, and the prisoner who could not get free.”\n\nAnd Faria extended the arm of which alone the use remained to him to\nthe young man, who threw himself upon his neck and wept.\n\n\n\n Chapter 19. The Third Attack\n\nNow that this treasure, which had so long been the object of the abbé’s\nmeditations, could insure the future happiness of him whom Faria really\nloved as a son, it had doubled its value in his eyes, and every day he\nexpatiated on the amount, explaining to Dantès all the good which, with\nthirteen or fourteen millions of francs, a man could do in these days\nto his friends; and then Dantès’ countenance became gloomy, for the\noath of vengeance he had taken recurred to his memory, and he reflected\nhow much ill, in these times, a man with thirteen or fourteen millions\ncould do to his enemies.\n\nThe abbé did not know the Island of Monte Cristo; but Dantès knew it,\nand had often passed it, situated twenty-five miles from Pianosa,\nbetween Corsica and the Island of Elba, and had once touched there.\nThis island was, always had been, and still is, completely deserted. It\nis a rock of almost conical form, which looks as though it had been\nthrust up by volcanic force from the depth to the surface of the ocean.\nDantès drew a plan of the island for Faria, and Faria gave Dantès\nadvice as to the means he should employ to recover the treasure. But\nDantès was far from being as enthusiastic and confident as the old man.\nIt was past a question now that Faria was not a lunatic, and the way in\nwhich he had achieved the discovery, which had given rise to the\nsuspicion of his madness, increased Edmond’s admiration of him; but at\nthe same time Dantès could not believe that the deposit, supposing it\nhad ever existed, still existed; and though he considered the treasure\nas by no means chimerical, he yet believed it was no longer there.\n\nHowever, as if fate resolved on depriving the prisoners of their last\nchance, and making them understand that they were condemned to\nperpetual imprisonment, a new misfortune befell them; the gallery on\nthe sea side, which had long been in ruins, was rebuilt. They had\nrepaired it completely, and stopped up with vast masses of stone the\nhole Dantès had partly filled in. But for this precaution, which, it\nwill be remembered, the abbé had made to Edmond, the misfortune would\nhave been still greater, for their attempt to escape would have been\ndetected, and they would undoubtedly have been separated. Thus a new, a\nstronger, and more inexorable barrier was interposed to cut off the\nrealization of their hopes.\n\n“You see,” said the young man, with an air of sorrowful resignation, to\nFaria, “that God deems it right to take from me any claim to merit for\nwhat you call my devotion to you.

Like a genuine Frenchman, Albert had employed his time in\narranging for the evening’s diversion; he had sent to engage a box at\nthe Teatro Argentina; and Franz, having a number of letters to write,\nrelinquished the carriage to Albert for the whole of the day.\n\nAt five o’clock Albert returned, delighted with his day’s work; he had\nbeen occupied in leaving his letters of introduction, and had received\nin return more invitations to balls and routs than it would be possible\nfor him to accept; besides this, he had seen (as he called it) all the\nremarkable sights at Rome. Yes, in a single day he had accomplished\nwhat his more serious-minded companion would have taken weeks to\neffect. Neither had he neglected to ascertain the name of the piece to\nbe played that night at the Teatro Argentina, and also what performers\nappeared in it. The opera of _Parisina_ was announced for\nrepresentation, and the principal actors were Coselli, Moriani, and La\nSpecchia.\n\nThe young men, therefore, had reason to consider themselves fortunate\nin having the opportunity of hearing one of the best works by the\ncomposer of _Lucia di Lammermoor_, supported by three of the most\nrenowned vocalists of Italy.\n\nAlbert had never been able to endure the Italian theatres, with their\norchestras from which it is impossible to see, and the absence of\nbalconies, or open boxes; all these defects pressed hard on a man who\nhad had his stall at the Bouffes, and had shared a lower box at the\nOpera. Still, in spite of this, Albert displayed his most dazzling and\neffective costumes each time he visited the theatres; but, alas, his\nelegant toilet was wholly thrown away, and one of the most worthy\nrepresentatives of Parisian fashion had to carry with him the\nmortifying reflection that he had nearly overrun Italy without meeting\nwith a single adventure.\n\nSometimes Albert would affect to make a joke of his want of success;\nbut internally he was deeply wounded, and his self-love immensely\npiqued, to think that Albert de Morcerf, the most admired and most\nsought after of any young person of his day, should thus be passed\nover, and merely have his labor for his pains. And the thing was so\nmuch the more annoying, as, according to the characteristic modesty of\na Frenchman, Albert had quitted Paris with the full conviction that he\nhad only to show himself in Italy to carry all before him, and that\nupon his return he should astonish the Parisian world with the recital\nof his numerous love-affairs.\n\nAlas, poor Albert! None of those interesting adventures fell in his\nway; the lovely Genoese, Florentines, and Neapolitans were all\nfaithful, if not to their husbands, at least to their lovers, and\nthought not of changing even for the splendid appearance of Albert de\nMorcerf; and all he gained was the painful conviction that the ladies\nof Italy have this advantage over those of France, that they are\nfaithful even in their infidelity.\n\nYet he could not restrain a hope that in Italy, as elsewhere, there\nmight be an exception to the general rule.\n\nAlbert, besides being an elegant, well-looking young man, was also\npossessed of considerable talent and ability; moreover, he was a\nviscount—a recently created one, certainly, but in the present day it\nis not necessary to go as far back as Noah in tracing a descent, and a\ngenealogical tree is equally estimated, whether dated from 1399 or\nmerely 1815; but to crown all these advantages, Albert de Morcerf\ncommanded an income of 50,000 livres, a more than sufficient sum to\nrender him a personage of considerable importance in Paris. It was\ntherefore no small mortification to him to have visited most of the\nprincipal cities in Italy without having excited the most trifling\nobservation.\n\nAlbert, however, hoped to indemnify himself for all these slights and\nindifferences during the Carnival, knowing full well th"}, {"chunk_id": 200, "text": "ce made that answer,\nthe safety of Rome was concerned; but, as for us, it is only to gratify\na whim, and it would be ridiculous to risk our lives for so foolish a\nmotive.”\n\nAlbert poured himself out a glass of _lacryma Christi_, which he sipped\nat intervals, muttering some unintelligible words.\n\n“Well, Signor Pastrini,” said Franz, “now that my companion is quieted,\nand you have seen how peaceful my intentions are, tell me who is this\nLuigi Vampa. Is he a shepherd or a nobleman?—young or old?—tall or\nshort? Describe him, in order that, if we meet him by chance, like Jean\nSbogar or Lara, we may recognize him.”\n\n“You could not apply to anyone better able to inform you on all these\npoints, for I knew him when he was a child, and one day that I fell\ninto his hands, going from Ferentino to Alatri, he, fortunately for me,\nrecollected me, and set me free, not only without ransom, but made me a\npresent of a very splendid watch, and related his history to me.”\n\n“Let us see the watch,” said Albert.\n\nSignor Pastrini drew from his fob a magnificent Bréguet, bearing the\nname of its maker, of Parisian manufacture, and a count’s coronet.\n\n“Here it is,” said he.\n\n“_Peste!_” returned Albert, “I compliment you on it; I have its\nfellow”—he took his watch from his waistcoat pocket—“and it cost me\n3,000 francs.”\n\n“Let us hear the history,” said Franz, motioning Signor Pastrini to\nseat himself.\n\n“Your excellencies permit it?” asked the host.\n\n“_Pardieu!_” cried Albert, “you are not a preacher, to remain\nstanding!”\n\nThe host sat down, after having made each of them a respectful bow,\nwhich meant that he was ready to tell them all they wished to know\nconcerning Luigi Vampa.\n\n“You tell me,” said Franz, at the moment Signor Pastrini was about to\nopen his mouth, “that you knew Luigi Vampa when he was a child—he is\nstill a young man, then?”\n\n“A young man? he is only two-and-twenty;—he will gain himself a\nreputation.”\n\n“What do you think of that, Albert?—at two-and-twenty to be thus\nfamous?”\n\n“Yes, and at his age, Alexander, Cæsar, and Napoleon, who have all made\nsome noise in the world, were quite behind him.”\n\n“So,” continued Franz, “the hero of this history is only\ntwo-and-twenty?”\n\n“Scarcely so much.”\n\n“Is he tall or short?”\n\n“Of the middle height—about the same stature as his excellency,”\nreturned the host, pointing to Albert.\n\n“Thanks for the comparison,” said Albert, with a bow.\n\n“Go on, Signor Pastrini,” continued Franz, smiling at his friend’s\nsusceptibility. “To what class of society does he belong?”\n\n“He was a shepherd-boy attached to the farm of the Count of San-Felice,\nsituated between Palestrina and the Lake of Gabri; he was born at\nPampinara, and entered the count’s service when he was five years old;\nhis father was also a shepherd, who owned a small flock, and lived by\nthe wool and the milk, which he sold at Rome. When quite a child, the\nlittle Vampa displayed a most extraordinary precocity. One day, when he\nwas seven years old, he came to the curate of Palestrina, and asked to\nbe taught to read; it was somewhat difficult, for he could not quit his\nflock; but the good curate went every day to say mass at a little\nhamlet too poor to pay a priest and which, having no other name, was\ncalled Borgo; he told Luigi that he might meet him on his return, and\nthat then he would give him a lesson, warning him that it would be\nshort, and that he must profit as much as possible by it. The child\naccepted joyfully. Every day Luigi led his flock to graze on the road\nthat leads from Palestrina to Borgo; every day, at nine o’clock in the\nmorning, the priest and the boy sat down on a bank by the wayside, and\nthe little shepherd took his lesson out of the priest’s breviary. At\nthe end of three months he had learned to read. This was not enough—he\nmust now learn to write.

So life went on for\nthem as it does for those who are not victims of misfortune and whose\nactivities glide along mechanically and tranquilly beneath the eye of\nProvidence.\n\nBut beneath this superficial calm there were in the heart of the young\nman, and perhaps in that of the old man, many repressed desires, many\nstifled sighs, which found vent when Faria was left alone, and when\nEdmond returned to his cell.\n\nOne night Edmond awoke suddenly, believing that he heard someone\ncalling him. He opened his eyes upon utter darkness. His name, or\nrather a plaintive voice which essayed to pronounce his name, reached\nhim. He sat up in bed and a cold sweat broke out upon his brow.\nUndoubtedly the call came from Faria’s dungeon.\n\n“Alas,” murmured Edmond; “can it be?”\n\nHe moved his bed, drew up the stone, rushed into the passage, and\nreached the opposite extremity; the secret entrance was open. By the\nlight of the wretched and wavering lamp, of which we have spoken,\nDantès saw the old man, pale, but yet erect, clinging to the bedstead.\nHis features were writhing with those horrible symptoms which he\nalready knew, and which had so seriously alarmed him when he saw them\nfor the first time.\n\n“Alas, my dear friend,” said Faria in a resigned tone, “you understand,\ndo you not, and I need not attempt to explain to you?”\n\nEdmond uttered a cry of agony, and, quite out of his senses, rushed\ntowards the door, exclaiming, “Help, help!”\n\nFaria had just sufficient strength to restrain him.\n\n“Silence,” he said, “or you are lost. We must now only think of you, my\ndear friend, and so act as to render your captivity supportable or your\nflight possible. It would require years to do again what I have done\nhere, and the results would be instantly destroyed if our jailers knew\nwe had communicated with each other. Besides, be assured, my dear\nEdmond, the dungeon I am about to leave will not long remain empty;\nsome other unfortunate being will soon take my place, and to him you\nwill appear like an angel of salvation. Perhaps he will be young,\nstrong, and enduring, like yourself, and will aid you in your escape,\nwhile I have been but a hindrance. You will no longer have half a dead\nbody tied to you as a drag to all your movements. At length Providence\nhas done something for you; he restores to you more than he takes away,\nand it was time I should die.”\n\nEdmond could only clasp his hands and exclaim, “Oh, my friend, my\nfriend, speak not thus!” and then resuming all his presence of mind,\nwhich had for a moment staggered under this blow, and his strength,\nwhich had failed at the words of the old man, he said, “Oh, I have\nsaved you once, and I will save you a second time!” And raising the\nfoot of the bed, he drew out the phial, still a third filled with the\nred liquor.\n\n“See,” he exclaimed, “there remains still some of the magic draught.\nQuick, quick! tell me what I must do this time; are there any fresh\ninstructions?

She had almost all the\nhonors of the quadrille, and if she were envious of the Count of\nSan-Felice’s daughter, we will not undertake to say that Carmela was\nnot jealous of her. And with overpowering compliments her handsome\ncavalier led her back to the place whence he had taken her, and where\nLuigi awaited her. Twice or thrice during the dance the young girl had\nglanced at Luigi, and each time she saw that he was pale and that his\nfeatures were agitated, once even the blade of his knife, half drawn\nfrom its sheath, had dazzled her eyes with its sinister glare. Thus, it\nwas almost tremblingly that she resumed her lover’s arm. The quadrille\nhad been most perfect, and it was evident there was a great demand for\na repetition, Carmela alone objecting to it, but the Count of\nSan-Felice besought his daughter so earnestly, that she acceded.\n\n“One of the cavaliers then hastened to invite Teresa, without whom it\nwas impossible for the quadrille to be formed, but the young girl had\ndisappeared.\n\n“The truth was, that Luigi had not felt the strength to support another\nsuch trial, and, half by persuasion and half by force, he had removed\nTeresa toward another part of the garden. Teresa had yielded in spite\nof herself, but when she looked at the agitated countenance of the\nyoung man, she understood by his silence and trembling voice that\nsomething strange was passing within him. She herself was not exempt\nfrom internal emotion, and without having done anything wrong, yet\nfully comprehended that Luigi was right in reproaching her. Why, she\ndid not know, but yet she did not the less feel that these reproaches\nwere merited.\n\n“However, to Teresa’s great astonishment, Luigi remained mute, and not\na word escaped his lips the rest of the evening. When the chill of the\nnight had driven away the guests from the gardens, and the gates of the\nvilla were closed on them for the _festa_ in-doors, he took Teresa\nquite away, and as he left her at her home, he said:\n\n“‘Teresa, what were you thinking of as you danced opposite the young\nCountess of San-Felice?’\n\n“‘I thought,’ replied the young girl, with all the frankness of her\nnature, ‘that I would give half my life for a costume such as she\nwore.’\n\n“‘And what said your cavalier to you?’\n\n“‘He said it only depended on myself to have it, and I had only one\nword to say.’\n\n“‘He was right,’ said Luigi. ‘Do you desire it as ardently as you say?’\n\n“‘Yes.’\n\n“‘Well, then, you shall have it!’\n\n“The young girl, much astonished, raised her head to look at him, but\nhis face was so gloomy and terrible that her words froze to her lips.\nAs Luigi spoke thus, he left her. Teresa followed him with her eyes\ninto the darkness as long as she could, and when he had quite\ndisappeared, she went into the house with a sigh.\n\n20121m\n\n\n\n“That night a memorable event occurred, due, no doubt, to the\nimprudence of some servant who had neglected to extinguish the lights.\nThe Villa of San-Felice took fire in the rooms adjoining the very\napartment of the lovely Carmela. Awakened in the night by the light of\nthe flames, she sprang out of bed, wrapped herself in a dressing-gown,\nand attempted to escape by the door, but the corridor by which she\nhoped to fly was already a prey to the flames. She then returned to her\nroom, calling for help as loudly as she could, when suddenly her\nwindow, which was twenty feet from the ground, was opened, a young\npeasant jumped into the chamber, seized her in his arms, and with\nsuperhuman skill and strength conveyed her to the turf of the\ngrass-plot, where she fainted. When she recovered, her father was by\nher side. All the servants surrounded her, offering her assistance. An\nentire wing of the villa was burnt down; but what of that, as long as\nCarmela was safe and uninjured?\n\n“Her preserver was everywhere sought for, but he did not appear; he was\ninquired after, but no one had seen him.

The mind\ncan see as well as the body. The body forgets sometimes; but the mind\nalways remembers.”\n\n“And how far back into the past do your recollections extend?”\n\n“I could scarcely walk when my mother, who was called Vasiliki, which\nmeans royal,” said the young girl, tossing her head proudly, “took me\nby the hand, and after putting in our purse all the money we possessed,\nwe went out, both covered with veils, to solicit alms for the\nprisoners, saying, ‘He who giveth to the poor lendeth to the Lord.’\nThen when our purse was full we returned to the palace, and without\nsaying a word to my father, we sent it to the convent, where it was\ndivided amongst the prisoners.”\n\n“And how old were you at that time?”\n\n“I was three years old,” said Haydée.\n\n“Then you remember everything that went on about you from the time when\nyou were three years old?” said Albert.\n\n“Everything.”\n\n“Count,” said Albert, in a low tone to Monte Cristo, “do allow the\nsignora to tell me something of her history. You prohibited my\nmentioning my father’s name to her, but perhaps she will allude to him\nof her own accord in the course of the recital, and you have no idea\nhow delighted I should be to hear our name pronounced by such beautiful\nlips.”\n\nMonte Cristo turned to Haydée, and with an expression of countenance\nwhich commanded her to pay the most implicit attention to his words, he\nsaid in Greek, “Πατρὸς μὲν ἄτην μήζε τὸ ὄνομα προδότου καὶ προδοσίαν\nεἰπὲ ἡμῖν,”—that is, “Tell us the fate of your father; but neither the\nname of the traitor nor the treason.” Haydée sighed deeply, and a shade\nof sadness clouded her beautiful brow.\n\n“What are you saying to her?” said Morcerf in an undertone.\n\n“I again reminded her that you were a friend, and that she need not\nconceal anything from you.”\n\n“Then,” said Albert, “this pious pilgrimage in behalf of the prisoners\nwas your first remembrance; what is the next?”\n\n“Oh, then I remember as if it were but yesterday sitting under the\nshade of some sycamore-trees, on the borders of a lake, in the waters\nof which the trembling foliage was reflected as in a mirror. Under the\noldest and thickest of these trees, reclining on cushions, sat my\nfather; my mother was at his feet, and I, childlike, amused myself by\nplaying with his long white beard which descended to his girdle, or\nwith the diamond-hilt of the scimitar attached to his girdle. Then from\ntime to time there came to him an Albanian who said something to which\nI paid no attention, but which he always answered in the same tone of\nvoice, either ‘Kill,’ or ‘Pardon.’”\n\n“It is very strange,” said Albert, “to hear such words proceed from the\nmouth of anyone but an actress on the stage, and one needs constantly\nto be saying to one’s self, ‘This is no fiction, it is all reality,’ in\norder to believe it. And how does France appear in your eyes,\naccustomed as they have been to gaze on such enchanted scenes?”\n\n“I think it is a fine country,” said Haydée, “but I see France as it\nreally is, because I look on it with the eyes of a woman; whereas my\nown country, which I can only judge of from the impression produced on\nmy childish mind, always seems enveloped in a vague atmosphere, which\nis luminous or otherwise, according as my remembrances of it are sad or\njoyous.”\n\n“So young,” said Albert, forgetting at the moment the Count’s command\nthat he should ask no questions of the slave herself, “is it possible\nthat you can have known what suffering is except by name?”\n\nHaydée turned her eyes towards Monte Cristo, who, making at the same\ntime some imperceptible sign, murmured:\n\n“Εἰπέ—speak.”\n\n“Nothing is ever so firmly impressed on the mind as the memory of our\nearly childhood, and with the exception of the two scenes I have just\nd"}, {"chunk_id": 445, "text": "he little spaniel.

Debray rose,\nsmiling, and was about to contradict the baroness upon this latter\npoint, when the door opened suddenly. M. Danglars appeared; Debray\nreseated himself. At the noise of the door Madame Danglars turned\nround, and looked upon her husband with an astonishment she took no\ntrouble to conceal.\n\n“Good-evening, madame,” said the banker; “good-evening, M. Debray.”\n\nProbably the baroness thought this unexpected visit signified a desire\nto make up for the sharp words he had uttered during the day. Assuming\na dignified air, she turned round to Debray, without answering her\nhusband.\n\n“Read me something, M. Debray,” she said. Debray, who was slightly\ndisturbed at this visit, recovered himself when he saw the calmness of\nthe baroness, and took up a book marked by a mother-of-pearl knife\ninlaid with gold.\n\n“Excuse me,” said the banker, “but you will tire yourself, baroness, by\nsuch late hours, and M. Debray lives some distance from here.”\n\nDebray was petrified, not only to hear Danglars speak so calmly and\npolitely, but because it was apparent that beneath outward politeness\nthere really lurked a determined spirit of opposition to anything his\nwife might wish to do. The baroness was also surprised, and showed her\nastonishment by a look which would doubtless have had some effect upon\nher husband if he had not been intently occupied with the paper, where\nhe was looking to see the closing stock quotations. The result was,\nthat the proud look entirely failed of its purpose.\n\n“M. Lucien,” said the baroness, “I assure you I have no desire to\nsleep, and that I have a thousand things to tell you this evening,\nwhich you must listen to, even though you slept while hearing me.”\n\n“I am at your service, madame,” replied Lucien coldly.\n\n“My dear M. Debray,” said the banker, “do not kill yourself tonight\nlistening to the follies of Madame Danglars, for you can hear them as\nwell tomorrow; but I claim tonight and will devote it, if you will\nallow me, to talk over some serious matters with my wife.”\n\nThis time the blow was so well aimed, and hit so directly, that Lucien\nand the baroness were staggered, and they interrogated each other with\ntheir eyes, as if to seek help against this aggression, but the\nirresistible will of the master of the house prevailed, and the husband\nwas victorious.\n\n“Do not think I wish to turn you out, my dear Debray,” continued\nDanglars; “oh, no, not at all. An unexpected occurrence forces me to\nask my wife to have a little conversation with me; it is so rarely I\nmake such a request, I am sure you cannot grudge it to me.”\n\nDebray muttered something, bowed and went out, knocking himself against\nthe edge of the door, like Nathan in _Athalie_.\n\n“It is extraordinary,” he said, when the door was closed behind him,\n“how easily these husbands, whom we ridicule, gain an advantage over\nus.”\n\n30241m\n\n\n\nLucien having left, Danglars took his place on the sofa, closed the\nopen book, and placing himself in a dreadfully dictatorial attitude, he\nbegan playing with the dog; but the animal, not liking him as well as\nDebray, and attempting to bite him, Danglars seized him by the skin of\nhis neck and threw him upon a couch on the other side of the room. The\nanimal uttered a cry during the transit, but, arrived at its\ndestination, it crouched behind the cushions, and stupefied at such\nunusual treatment remained silent and motionless.\n\n“Do you know, sir,” asked the baroness, “that you are improving?\nGenerally you are only rude, but tonight you are brutal.”\n\n“It is because I am in a worse humor than usual,” replied Danglars.\nHermine looked at the banker with supreme disdain.

Thus a new, a\nstronger, and more inexorable barrier was interposed to cut off the\nrealization of their hopes.\n\n“You see,” said the young man, with an air of sorrowful resignation, to\nFaria, “that God deems it right to take from me any claim to merit for\nwhat you call my devotion to you. I have promised to remain forever\nwith you, and now I could not break my promise if I would. The treasure\nwill be no more mine than yours, and neither of us will quit this\nprison. But my real treasure is not that, my dear friend, which awaits\nme beneath the sombre rocks of Monte Cristo, it is your presence, our\nliving together five or six hours a day, in spite of our jailers; it is\nthe rays of intelligence you have elicited from my brain, the languages\nyou have implanted in my memory, and which have taken root there with\nall their philological ramifications. These different sciences that you\nhave made so easy to me by the depth of the knowledge you possess of\nthem, and the clearness of the principles to which you have reduced\nthem—this is my treasure, my beloved friend, and with this you have\nmade me rich and happy. Believe me, and take comfort, this is better\nfor me than tons of gold and cases of diamonds, even were they not as\nproblematical as the clouds we see in the morning floating over the\nsea, which we take for _terra firma_, and which evaporate and vanish as\nwe draw near to them. To have you as long as possible near me, to hear\nyour eloquent speech,—which embellishes my mind, strengthens my soul,\nand makes my whole frame capable of great and terrible things, if I\nshould ever be free,—so fills my whole existence, that the despair to\nwhich I was just on the point of yielding when I knew you, has no\nlonger any hold over me; and this—this is my fortune—not chimerical,\nbut actual. I owe you my real good, my present happiness; and all the\nsovereigns of the earth, even Cæsar Borgia himself, could not deprive\nme of this.”\n\nThus, if not actually happy, yet the days these two unfortunates passed\ntogether went quickly. Faria, who for so long a time had kept silence\nas to the treasure, now perpetually talked of it. As he had prophesied\nwould be the case, he remained paralyzed in the right arm and the left\nleg, and had given up all hope of ever enjoying it himself. But he was\ncontinually thinking over some means of escape for his young companion,\nand anticipating the pleasure he would enjoy. For fear the letter might\nbe some day lost or stolen, he compelled Dantès to learn it by heart;\nand Dantès knew it from the first to the last word. Then he destroyed\nthe second portion, assured that if the first were seized, no one would\nbe able to discover its real meaning. Whole hours sometimes passed\nwhile Faria was giving instructions to Dantès,—instructions which were\nto serve him when he was at liberty. Then, once free, from the day and\nhour and moment when he was so, he could have but one only thought,\nwhich was, to gain Monte Cristo by some means, and remain there alone\nunder some pretext which would arouse no suspicions; and once there, to\nendeavor to find the wonderful caverns, and search in the appointed\nspot,—the appointed spot, be it remembered, being the farthest angle in\nthe second opening.\n\nIn the meanwhile the hours passed, if not rapidly, at least tolerably.\nFaria, as we have said, without having recovered the use of his hand\nand foot, had regained all the clearness of his understanding, and had\ngradually, besides the moral instructions we have detailed, taught his\nyouthful companion the patient and sublime duty of a prisoner, who\nlearns to make something from nothing. They were thus perpetually\nemployed,—Faria, that he might not see himself grow old; Dantès, for\nfear of recalling the almost extinct past which now only floated in his\nmemory like a distant light wandering in the night.

But the major assumed the\ntask of saddling the horses, renewing the provisions, and making his\narrangements for the journey.

Suddenly the unfortunate\nvictim rose; but a violent blow with the \"méré,\" a formidable club,\nwielded by the hand of the chief, struck her lifeless to the earth.\n\n[Sidenote: POOR HUMANITY!]\n\nFrightful cries at once broke forth. A hundred arms threatened the\ncaptives, who trembled at the horrible sight. But no one stirred, for\nthe funeral ceremonies were not ended.\n\nKara-Tété's wife had joined her husband in the other world. Both bodies\nlay side by side. But for the eternal life his faithful spouse could\nnot alone suffice the deceased. Who would serve them in presence of\nNouï-Atoua, if their slaves did not follow them?\n\nSix unfortunates were brought before the corpse of their master and\nmistress. They were servants, whom the pitiless laws of war had reduced\nto slavery. During the life of the chief they had undergone the\nseverest privations, suffered a thousand abuses, had been scantily fed,\nand compelled constantly to labor like beasts; and now, according to\nthe Maori belief, they were to continue their existence of servitude\nfor eternity.\n\nThey appeared to be resigned to their fate, and were not astonished\nat a sacrifice they had long anticipated. Their freedom from all\nbonds showed that they would meet death unresistingly. Moreover, this\ndeath was rapid, protracted sufferings were spared them. These were\nreserved for the captives who stood trembling not twenty paces distant.\nSix blows of the méré, given by six stalwart warriors, stretched the\nvictims on the ground in a pool of blood. It was the signal for a\nterrible scene of cannibalism, which followed in all its horrible\ndetails.\n\nGlenarvan and his companions, breathless with fright, strove to hide\nthis awful scene from the eyes of the two unhappy ladies. They now\nunderstood what awaited them at sunrise the next day, and what cruel\ntortures would doubtless precede such a death. They were dumb with\nhorror.\n\nThe funeral dance now began. Strong spirits, extracted from an\nindigenous plant, maddened the savages till they seemed no longer\nhuman. Would they not forget the taboo of the chief, and throw\nthemselves in their final outbreaks upon the prisoners who trembled at\ntheir frenzy?\n\n[Illustration: A terrible scene of cannibalism, which followed in all\nits horrible details.]\n\n[Illustration: The corpses, folded together, in a sitting posture,\nand tied in their clothes by a girdle of withes, were placed on this\nprimitive bier.]\n\nBut Kai-Koumou had preserved his reason in the midst of the general\nintoxication. He allowed this bloody orgy an hour to reach its utmost\nintensity. The last act of the funeral was played with the usual rites.\n\nThe bodies of Kara-Tété and his wife were taken up, and their limbs"}, {"chunk_id": 10, "text": "boy of twelve years, of determined look, who seemed\nto take his sister under his protection. Indeed, whoever had insulted\nthe young girl would have had to settle with this little gentleman.\n\nThe sister stopped, a little surprised at seeing herself before Lady\nHelena; but the latter hastened to open the conversation.\n\n\"You wish to speak with me?\" said she, with an encouraging look at the\nyoung girl.\n\n[Sidenote: \"ONE TOUCH OF NATURE.\"]\n\n\"No,\" answered the boy, in a decided tone; \"not with you, but with Lord\nGlenarvan himself.\"\n\n\"Excuse him, madam,\" said the sister, looking at her brother.\n\n\"Lord Glenarvan is not at the castle,\" replied Lady Helena; \"but I am\nhis wife, and if I can supply his place with you----\"\n\n\"You are Lady Glenarvan?\" said the young girl.\n\n\"Yes, miss.\"\n\n\"The wife of Lord Glenarvan, of Malcolm Castle, who published an\nadvertisement in the _Times_ in regard to the shipwreck of the\nBritannia?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes!\" answered Lady Helena, with alacrity. \"And you?\"\n\n\"I am Miss Grant, and this is my brother.\"\n\n\"Miss Grant! Miss Grant!\" cried Lady Helena, drawing the young girl\ntowards her, and taking her hands, while she also drew the boy towards\nher.\n\n\"Madam,\" replied the young girl, \"what do you know of the shipwreck of\nmy father? Is he living? Shall we ever see him again? Speak! oh, please\ntell me!\"\n\n\"My dear child,\" said Lady Helena, \"God forbid that I should answer you\nlightly on such a subject; I would not give you a vain hope----\"\n\n\"Please, madam, speak! I am strong against grief, and can hear all.\"\n\n\"My dear child,\" answered Lady Helena, \"the hope is very slight, but\nwith the help of God who can do everything, it is possible that you\nwill one day see your father again.\"\n\n\"Alas, alas!\" exclaimed Miss Grant, who could not restrain her tears,\nwhile Robert covered the hands of Lady Glenarvan with kisses.\n\nWhen the first paroxysm of this mournful joy was past, the young girl\nbegan to ask innumerable questions. Lady Helena related the story of\nthe document, how that the Britannia had been lost on the shores\nof Patagonia; in what way, after the shipwreck, the captain and two\nsailors, the only survivors, must have reached the continent; and,\nat last, how they implored the assistance of the whole world in this\ndocument, written in three languages, and abandoned to the caprices of\nthe ocean.\n\nDuring this recital Robert Grant devoured Lady Helena with his eyes;\nhis life seemed to hang on her lips. In his childish imagination he\nreviewed the terrible scenes of which his father must have been the\nvictim. He saw him on the deck of the Britannia; he followed him to the\nbosom of the waves; he clung with him to the rocks of the shore; he\ndragged himself panting along the beach, out of reach of the waves.\n\nOften during the course of this narration words escaped his lips.\n\n\"Oh, papa! my poor papa!\" he cried, pressing close to his sister.\n\nAs for Miss Grant, she listened with clasped hands, and did not utter a\nword until the story was ended, when she said,--\n\n\"Oh, madam, the document! the document!\"\n\n\"I no longer have it, my dear child,\" replied Lady Helena.\n\n\"You no longer have it?\"\n\n\"No; for the very sake of your father, Lord Glenarvan had to take it\nto London; but I have told you all it contained, word for word, and\nhow we succeeded in discovering the exact meaning. Among these remains\nof the almost effaced words the water had spared some characters.\nUnfortunately the record of the longitude had altogether been\ndestroyed, but that was the only missing point.

The sides of the rancho cracked as if they would\nbreak, while the frail structure bent beneath the gusts of wind and\nthreatened to give way at every shock. The unfortunate horses neighed\nin terror without, exposed to the inclemency of the tempest; and their\nmasters did not suffer less in their miserable shelter. However, sleep\ndrowned all their troubles at last. Robert first closed his eyes,\nreclining his head on Lord Glenarvan's shoulder; and soon all the\ninmates of the rancho slept under the protection of God.\n\nThey woke the next morning at the call of Thaouka, who, always ready,\nneighed without, and struck the wall of the hut vigorously with his\nhoof, as though to give the signal for departure. They owed him too\nmuch not to obey him, and they accordingly resumed their journey.\n\nThe rain had ceased, but the hard earth held what had fallen. On the\nimpenetrable clay, pools, marshes, and ponds overflowed and formed\nimmense \"bañados\" of treacherous depth. Paganel, on consulting his map,\njudged rightly that the Grande and Nivarota Rivers, into which the\nwaters of the plain usually flow, must have mingled together in one\nbroad stream.\n\nAn extremely rapid advance, therefore, became necessary. The common\nsafety was at stake. If the inundation increased, where could they find\na refuge? The vast circle of the horizon did not offer a single point,\nand on this level plain the progress of the water must be rapid. The\nhorses were urged to their utmost speed. Thaouka took the lead, and\nmight have borne the name of sea-horse, for he pranced as if he had\nbeen in his native element.\n\nSuddenly, about six o'clock in the evening, he manifested signs of\nextreme agitation. He turned frequently towards the vast expanse to the\nsouth; his neighs were prolonged, his nostrils keenly snuffed the air,\nand he reared violently. Thalcave, whom his antics could not unseat,\nmanaged his steed without difficulty. The froth from the horse's mouth\nwas mingled with blood under the action of the firmly-closed bit, and\nyet the spirited animal could not be calm. If free, his master felt but\ntoo well that he would have fled away at full speed towards the north.\n\n\"What is the matter with Thaouka?\" asked Paganel. \"Has he been bitten\nby those voracious blood-suckers of the Argentine waters?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied the Indian.\n\n\"Is he terrified, then, at some danger?\"\n\n\"Yes, he has scented danger.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"I do not know.\"\n\nAlthough the eye did not yet reveal the peril that Thaouka divined,\nthe ear could already detect it. A low murmur, like the sound of a\nrising tide, was heard as from the limit of the horizon. The wind blew\nin damp gusts laden with spray; the birds, as if fleeing from some\nunknown phenomenon, shot swiftly through the air; and the horses,\nwading to their knees, felt the first impulse of the current. Soon a\nmingled roar, like bellowing, neighing, and bleating, resounded half\na mile to the south, and immense herds appeared, tumbling, rising,\nand rushing, a confused mass of terrified beasts, and fled by with\nfrightful rapidity. It was scarcely possible to distinguish them in the\nmidst of the clouds of spray dashed up by their flight.\n\n[Illustration: \"The flood! the flood!\" replied Thalcave, spurring his\nhorse towards the north.]\n\n\"Quick! quick!\" cried Thalcave, in a piercing voice.\n\n\"What is it?\" said Paganel.\n\n\"The flood! the flood!\" replied Thalcave, spurring his horse towards\nthe north.\n\n\"The inundation!\" cried Paganel; and his companions, with him at their\nhead, fled away in the track of Thaouka.\n\nIt was time. Five miles to the south a high and broad wall of water\nwas rushing over the plain, which was fast becoming an ocean. The tall\ngrass disappeared as before the scythe, and the tufts of mimosas, torn\nup by the current, separated and formed floating islands. The mass of\nwaters spread itself in broad waves of irresistible power. The dikes of\nthe great rivers had evidently given way, and perhaps the waters of the\nColorado and Rio Negro were now mingling"}, {"chunk_id": 64, "text": "nd did\nnot leave his weapon, and he awaited with firm bearing the assault of\nthe enraged wolves.\n\nMeantime, Glenarvan, after coolly considering the situation, resolved\nto do something decisive.\n\n\"In one hour,\" said he, \"we shall have no more powder, shot, or fire.\nWe must not wait till then to make a sally.\"\n\nHe turned towards Thalcave, and, recalling a few words of Spanish,\nbegan a conversation with the Indian, frequently interrupted by the\ncracks of the rifle.\n\nIt was not without difficulty that these two men succeeded in\nunderstanding each other. Glenarvan, fortunately, knew the habits of\nthe red wolf. Without this knowledge he could not have interpreted the\nwords and gestures of the Patagonian.\n\nNevertheless, a quarter of an hour passed before he could give to\nRobert the meaning of Thalcave's answer. He had questioned the Indian\nconcerning their situation.\n\n\"And what did he answer?\" inquired Robert.\n\n\"He said that, cost what it may, we must hold out till daybreak. The\naguara goes out only at night, and when morning comes he returns to\nhis lair. He is the wolf of darkness, a cowardly beast that fears the\ndaylight.\"\n\n\"Well, let us defend ourselves till day.\"\n\n\"Yes, my boy, and with our knives if we can no longer use our guns.\"\n\nAlready Thalcave had set the example, and when a wolf approached the\nfire, the long knife of the Patagonian was thrust through the flames\nand drawn back again red with blood.\n\nHowever, the means of defense were failing. About two o'clock in the\nmorning, Thalcave threw into the fire the last armful of fuel, and the\nbesieged had only five charges left.\n\nGlenarvan cast about him a sorrowful glance. He thought of the child\nwho was there, of his companions, of all whom he loved. Robert said\nnothing; perhaps the danger did not appear imminent to his hopeful\nspirit. But Glenarvan pictured to himself that terrible event, now\napparently inevitable, the being devoured alive! He was not master of\nhis emotion; he drew the child to his breast, he clasped him to his\nheart, he pressed his lips to his forehead, while tears flowed from his\neyes.\n\nRobert gazed at him with a smile. \"I am not afraid,\" said he.\n\n\"No, my boy, no,\" replied Glenarvan; \"and you are right. In two hours,\nday will appear, and we shall be saved! Well done, Thalcave, my brave\nPatagonian!\" cried he, as the Indian killed with the butt of his gun\ntwo enormous beasts that were attempting to cross the glowing barrier.\n\n[Sidenote: A DYING HOPE.]\n\nBut at this moment the dying light of the fire showed him the aguaras\nadvancing in a dense body to assail the ramada. The dénouement of the\nbloody drama was approaching. The fire gradually subsided, for want\nof fuel; the flames sank; the plain, before illumined, now relapsed\ninto shadow, and in the shadow reappeared the terrible eyes of the red\nwolves. A few moments more, and the whole drove would rush into the\ninclosure.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThalcave discharged his carbine for the last time, stretched out one\nmore of their enemies, and, as his ammunition was exhausted, folded\nhis arms. His head sank upon his breast; he appeared to be questioning\nhimself. Was he searching for some bold, novel, or rash scheme for\nrepelling this furious herd? Glenarvan did not venture to ask him.\n\nAt this moment a change took place in the action of the wolves. They\nseemed to be retreating, and their howls, so deafening before, suddenly\nceased. An ominous silence reigned over the plain.\n\n\"They are going,\" said Robert.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" replied Glenarvan, who was listening with intentness.\n\nBut Thalcave shook his head. He knew well that the animals would not\nabandon a certain prey until at daybreak they returned to their holes\nand dens.\n\nHowever, the tactics of their enemies had evidently changed, they no\nlonger endeavored to force the entrance of the ramada; but their new\nmanoeuvres were already causing a still more imminent danger.\n\nThe wolves, abandoning their design of penetrating the inclosure by\nthis entrance, which was defended by wea"}]}

The\ndanger was increasing every moment. Already the broken stakes were\nyielding to the teeth and claws of the wolves. But neither Glenarvan\nnor Thalcave appeared willing to yield. The Indian had drawn Glenarvan\ntowards the entrance of the inclosure. He pointed to the plain, now\nfree from wolves. In his animated language, he explained that not a\nmoment was to be lost; that the danger, if this plan failed, would be\ngreater for those who remained; in short, that he alone knew Thaouka\nwell enough to employ his marvelous agility and speed for the common\nsafety. Glenarvan blindly persisted in his resolve to sacrifice\nhimself, when suddenly he was pushed violently back. Thaouka pranced,\nreared on his hind legs, and all at once, with a spring, cleared the\nbarrier of fire and the rampart of bodies, while a boyish voice cried,--\n\n\"God save you, my lord!\"\n\nGlenarvan and Thalcave had scarcely time to perceive Robert, who,\nclinging to the horse's mane, disappeared in the darkness.\n\n\"Robert, unfortunate!\" cried Glenarvan.\n\nBut these words the Indian himself could not hear. Frightful howls\nresounded. The wolves, starting on the track of the horse, fled into\nthe darkness with a terrible speed.\n\nThalcave and Glenarvan rushed out of the ramada. Already the plain had\nresumed its tranquillity, and they could scarcely distinguish a moving\nline which undulated afar in the shadows of the night.\n\nGlenarvan sank upon the ground, overcome, in despair, clasping his\nhands. He gazed at Thalcave, who smiled with his accustomed calmness.\n\n\"Thaouka--good horse--brave child--he will be saved!\" he repeated,\nnodding his head.\n\n\"But if he falls?\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\"He will not fall!\"\n\nIn spite of Thalcave's confidence, his companion passed the night in\nterrible anguish. He was no longer even mindful of the danger still to\nbe feared from the wolves. He would have gone in search of Robert, but\nthe Indian restrained him, and explained that their horses could not\novertake the boy, that Thaouka must have distanced his enemies, and\ncould not be found in the darkness. They must wait for day to start in\nsearch of Robert.\n\nAt four o'clock in the morning day began to break. The mists of the\nhorizon were soon tinged with pale rays. A sparkling dew covered the\nplain, and the tall grass began to wave under the first breezes of the\ndawn.\n\nThe moment of departure had arrived.\n\n\"Forward!\" said the Indian.\n\nGlenarvan did not reply, but sprang upon Robert's horse, and the two\nwere soon galloping towards the west in the direction from which their\ncompanions were to come.\n\nFor an hour they traveled thus with great speed, gazing around for\nRobert, and dreading at each step to behold his mangled body. Glenarvan\ntortured the flanks of his horse with his spurs. Suddenly shots were\nheard, and reports at regular intervals, like signals for recognition.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"It is they!\" cried Glenarvan.\n\nThalcave and he urged their horses to a more rapid pace, and a few\nmoments afterwards they joined the party led by Paganel.\n\n[Sidenote: LIVELY GRATITUDE.]\n\nTo Glenarvan's joy, Robert was there, alive, borne by the noble\nThaouka, who neighed with pleasure at seeing his master.\n\n\"Ah, my boy! my boy!\" cried Glenarvan, with unspeakable tenderness; and\nRobert and he, dismounting, rushed into each other's arms.\n\nThen it was the Indian's turn to clasp to his breast the courageous son\nof Captain Grant.\n\n\"He lives! he lives!\" exclaimed Glenarvan.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Robert, \"thanks to Thaouka.\"\n\nThe Indian had not waited for these words of gratitude to embrace his\nhorse, but at that very moment he spoke to him and embraced him, as\nif human blood flowed in the veins of the noble animal.

At last the major\ninterrupted it by saying:\n\n\"My friends, reserve this extreme measure till the last moment. I am no\nadvocate of what is irremediable.\"\n\n\"I do not speak for ourselves,\" replied Glenarvan. \"We can brave\ndeath, whatever it may be. Ah, if we were alone! Twenty times already\nwould I have urged you to make a sally and attack those wretches. But\n_they_----\"\n\n[Sidenote: THE APPROACH OF DAY.]\n\nAt this moment Captain Mangles raised the mat and counted twenty-five\nnatives, who were watching at the door of their prison. A great fire\nhad been kindled, which cast a dismal light over the irregular outlines\nof the pah. Some of these savages were stretched around the fire; and\nothers, standing and motionless, were darkly defined against the bright\ncurtain of flame.\n\nIt is said that, between the jailer who watches and the prisoner who\nwishes to escape, the chances are on the side of the latter. Indeed,\nthe design of one is stronger than that of the other, for the first\nmay forget that he is guarding, but the second cannot forget that he\nis guarded; the captive thinks oftener of escaping than his guardian\nthinks of preventing his escape. But here it was hate and vengeance\nthat watched the prisoners, and not an indifferent jailer. They had not\nbeen bound, for bonds were useless where twenty-five men guarded the\nonly outlet of the prison.\n\nThis hut was built against the rock that terminated the fortification,\nand was only accessible by a narrow passage that connected it with the\nfront of the pah. The other two sides of the building were flanked\nby towering precipices, and stood on the verge of an abyss a hundred\nfeet deep. A descent this way was therefore impossible. There was no\nchance of escaping in the rear, which was guarded by the enormous rock.\nThe only exit was the door of the temple, and the Maoris defended the\nnarrow passage that connected it with the pah. All escape was therefore\nout of the question; and Glenarvan, after examining the walls of his\nprison, was forced to acknowledge this disheartening fact.\n\nMeantime, the hours of this night of anguish were passing away. Dense\ndarkness had covered the mountain. Neither moon nor stars illumined\nthe deep shades. A few gusts of wind swept along the side of the\npah. The stakes of the hut groaned, the fire of the natives suddenly\nrevived at this passing draught, and the flames cast rapid flashes\ninto the temple, illumining for a moment the group of prisoners. These\npoor people were absorbed with their last thoughts; a deathly silence\nreigned in the hut.\n\nIt must have been about four o'clock in the morning, when the major's\nattention was attracted by a s"}, {"chunk_id": 11, "text": " missing point.

It would not change matters.\nLady Helena was, therefore, silent on this point, and, after satisfying\nall Miss Grant's inquiries, she questioned her concerning her life, and\nsituation in the world in which she seemed to be the sole protectress\nof her brother. It was a simple and touching story, which still more\nincreased Lady Glenarvan's sympathy for the young girl.\n\nMary and Robert Grant were the only children of Captain Harry Grant,\nwhose wife had died at the birth of Robert, and during his long\nvoyages his children were left to the care of his good old cousin.\nCaptain Grant was a hardy sailor, a man well acquainted with his\nprofession, and a good negotiator, combining thus a twofold aptitude\nfor his calling commercially. His home was at Dundee, in the county of\nForfar, and he was moreover, by birth, a child of that \"bonnie\" place.\nHis father, a minister of Saint Catherine's Church, had given him a\nthorough education, knowing that it would be sure to help all, even a\nsea-captain.\n\n[Sidenote: IDEAS AND REALITIES.]\n\nDuring his early voyages, first as mate, and afterwards in the\ncapacity of skipper, Harry Grant prospered, and some years after\nthe birth of his son Robert, he found himself the possessor of a\nconsiderable fortune.\n\nThen a great idea entered his mind which made his name popular\nthroughout Scotland. Like the Glenarvans and several other great\nfamilies of the Highlands, he was opposed in heart, if not in deed,\nto the advance and prevalence of English thought and feeling. The\ninterests of his country could not be in his eyes the same as those\nof the Anglo-Saxons, and, in order to give the former a peculiar and\nnational development, he resolved to found a Scottish colony in some\npart of the Southern World. Did he dream of that independence in the\nfuture of which the United States had set the example, and which the\nIndies and Australia cannot fail one day to acquire? Very likely;\nbut he allowed his secret hopes to be divined. It was, therefore,\nknown that the Government refused to lend their aid in his project\nof colonization; nay, they even raised obstacles which in any"}, {"chunk_id": 161, "text": "ed along with indescribable fury. It was certain death to brave\nthis torrent. Glenarvan, with folded arms and lowered head, stood\nmotionless.\n\n\"Do you wish me to try to swim to the opposite bank?\" asked Captain\nMangles.\n\n\"No, John,\" replied Glenarvan, seizing the bold young man by the hand;\n\"let us wait.\"\n\nThey both returned to the encampment. The day was passed in the most\nlively anxiety. Ten times did Glenarvan return to the river. He sought\nto contrive some bold plan of crossing it, but in vain. It would not\nhave been more impassable if a torrent of lava had flowed between its\nbanks.\n\nDuring these long hours of delay, Lady Helena, with the major's\nassistance, bestowed upon Mulready the most skillful care. The sailor\nfelt that he was returning to life. MacNabb ventured to affirm that no\nvital organ had been injured, the loss of blood sufficiently explained\nthe patient's weakness. Thus, as soon as his wound was healed and the\nhemorrhage stopped, only time and rest were needed for his complete\nrestoration. Lady Helena had insisted upon his occupying her end of the\ncart. Mulready felt greatly honored. His greatest anxiety was in the\nthought that his condition might delay Glenarvan, and he forced them to\npromise that they would leave him at the camp in charge of Wilson, as\nsoon as the river became fordable.\n\nUnfortunately, this was not possible, either that day or the next. At\nseeing himself thus detained, Glenarvan despaired. Lady Helena and the\nmajor tried in vain to pacify and exhort him to patience. Patience!\nwhen, at that moment perhaps, Ben Joyce was going on board the yacht,\nwhen the Duncan was weighing anchor and steaming towards that fatal\ncoast, to which every hour brought her nearer!\n\n[Sidenote: ALMOST DESPAIRING.]\n\nCaptain Mangles felt at heart all Glenarvan's anguish, and, as he\nwished to overcome the difficulty at all hazards, he constructed a\ncanoe in the Australian fashion, with large pieces of the bark of the\ngum-trees. These slabs, which were very light, were held together by\nwooden cross-bars, and formed a very frail craft.\n\nThe captain and the sailor tried the canoe. All that skill, strength,\nor courage could do they did. But scarcely were they in the current,\nwhen they capsized and narrowly escaped with their lives. The boat was\ndrawn into the eddies and disappeared. Captain Mangles and Wilson had\nnot advanced ten yards into the river, which was swollen by the rains\nand melting snows till it was now a mile in breadth.\n\nTwo days were wasted in this way. The major and Glenarvan went five\nmiles up stream without finding a practicable ford. Everywhere was the\nsame impetuosity, the same tumultuous rush of water; all the southern\nslopes of the mountains had poured their liquid torrents into this\nsingle stream. They were forced, therefore, to give up any hope of\nsaving the Duncan. Five days had passed since Ben Joyce's departure,\nthe yacht was probably that very moment at the coast, in the hands of\nthe convicts.\n\nHowever, this state of things could not last long. Indeed, on the\nmorning of the third day, Paganel perceived that the waters were\nbeginning to subside. He reported to Glenarvan the result of his\nobservations.\n\n\"What does it matter now?\" replied Glenarvan; \"it is too late!\"\n\n\"That is no reason for prolonging our stay at the encampment,\" replied\nthe major.\n\n\"Certainly not,\" said Captain Mangles; \"to-morrow, perhaps, it will be\npossible to cross.\"\n\n\"But will that save my unfortunate crew?\" cried Glenarvan.\n\n\"Listen to me, my lord,\" continued Captain Mangles. \"I know Tom Austin.\nHe was to execute your orders, and start as soon as his departure was\npossible. Who knows whether the Duncan was ready, or her injuries\nrepaired, on the arrival of Ben Joyce at Melbourne? Supposing the\nyacht could not put to sea, and suffered one or two days of delay?\"\n\n\"You are right, John,\" replied Glenarvan. \"We must reach Twofold Bay.\nWe are only thirty-five miles from Delegete.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Paganel, \"and in that town we shall fi"}]}

A few moments after\nthey were led back to the temple that served as their prison; but\nRobert Grant and Paganel were no longer with them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER L.\n\nTHE CHIEF'S FUNERAL.\n\n\nKai-Koumou, according to a custom quite ordinary in New Zealand, joined\nthe rank of priest to that of chief, and could, therefore, extend to\npersons or objects the superstitious protection of the taboo.\n\nThe taboo, which is common to the tribes of Polynesia, has the power\nto prohibit at once all connection with the object or person tabooed.\nAccording to the Maori religion, whoever should lay his sacrilegious\nhand on what is declared taboo would be punished with death by the\noffended god; and in case the divinity should delay to avenge his own\ninsult, the priests would not fail to excite his anger.\n\nAs for the prisoners confined in the temple, the taboo had rescued\nthem from the fury of the tribe. Some of the natives, the friends and\npartisans of Kai-Koumou, had stopped suddenly at the command of their\nchief, and had protected the captives.\n\n[Sidenote: THE TORTURES OF SUSPENSE.]\n\nGlenarvan, however, was not blind to the fate that was reserved for\nhim. Only his death could atone for the murder of a chief. Among savage\nraces death is always preceded by a protracted torture. He therefore\nexpected to cruelly expiate the righteous indignation that had nerved\nhis arm, but hoped that Kai-Koumou's rage would fall only on himself.\n\nWhat a night he and his companions passed! Who could depict their\nanguish, or measure their sufferings? Neither poor Robert nor brave\nPaganel had reappeared. But how could they doubt their fate? Were they\nnot the first victims of the natives' vengeance? All hope had vanished\neven from the heart of the major, who did not easily despair. John\nMangles felt himself growing mad at sight of the sad dejection of Mary\nGrant, thus separated from her brother. Glenarvan thought of that\nterrible request of Lady Helena, who, rather than yield to torture or\nslavery, preferred to die by his hand. Could he summon this fearful\ncourage? As for an escape, that was plainly impossible. Ten warriors,\narmed to the teeth, guarded the entrance of the temple.\n\nMorning came at last. There had been no communication between the\nnatives and the prisoners. The hut contained a considerable quantity\nof food, which the unfortunates scarcely touched. Hunger gave place to\ngrief. The day passed without bringing a change or a hope. Doubtless\nthe hour for the dead chief's funeral and their torture would be the\nsame.\n\nHowever, although Glenarvan concluded that Kai-Koumou must have\nabandoned all idea of exchange, the major on this point retained a\ngleam of hope.\n\n\"Who knows,\" said he, reminding Glenarvan of the effect produced upon\nthe chief by the death of Kara-Tété,--\"who knows but that Kai-Koumou in\nreality feels obliged to you?\"\n\nBut, in spite of these observations, Glenarvan would no longer hope.\nThe next day also passed away without the preparations for torture\nbeing made. The reason of the delay was this.\n\nThe Maoris believe that the soul, for three days after death, inhabits\nthe body of the deceased, and therefore during this time the corpse\nremains unburied. This custom was rigorously observed, and for two days\nthe pah was deserted. Captain Mangles frequently stood on Wilson's\nshoulders and surveyed the fortification. No native was seen; only the\nsentinels guarded in turn at the door of their prison.\n\nBut on the third day the huts were opened. The savages, men, women,\nand children, to the number of several hundreds, assembled in the pah,\nsilent and calm. Kai-Koumou came out of his house, and, surrounded by\nthe principal warriors of his tribe, took his place on a mound several\nfeet high in the centre of the fortification. The crowd of natives\nformed a semicircle aroun"}, {"chunk_id": 186, "text": "ome still suffering from recent wounds, stood in perfect immobility,\nenveloped in their flaxen mantles. Three dogs of wild appearance were\nstretched at their feet. The eight rowers seemed to be servants or\nslaves of the chief. They worked vigorously, and the boat ascended the\ncurrent of the Waikato with remarkable swiftness.\n\nIn the centre of this long canoe, with feet tied, but hands free, were\nten European prisoners clinging closely to each other. They were Lord\nGlenarvan and his companions.\n\n[Sidenote: A TESTING TIME.]\n\nThe evening before, the little party, led astray by the dense fog, had\nencamped in the midst of a numerous tribe of natives. About midnight,\nthe travelers, surprised in their sleep, were made prisoners and\ncarried on board the canoe. They had not yet been maltreated, but had\ntried in vain to resist. Their arms and ammunition were in the hands of\nthe savages, and their own bullets would have quickly stretched them on\nthe earth had they attempted to escape.\n\nThey were not long in learning, by the aid of a few English words which\nthe natives used, that, being driven back by the British troops, they\nwere returning, vanquished and weakened, to the regions of the upper\nWaikato. Their chief, after an obstinate resistance, in which he lost\nhis principal warriors, was now on his way to rouse again the river\ntribes. He was called Kai-Koumou, a terrible name, which signified\nin the native language \"he who eats the limbs of his enemy.\" He was\nbrave and bold, but his cruelty equaled his bravery. No pity could be\nexpected from him. His name was well known to the English soldiers, and\na price had been set upon his head by the governor of New Zealand.\n\nThis terrible catastrophe had come upon Glenarvan just as he was\nabout reaching the long-desired harbor of Auckland, whence he would\nhave returned to his native country. Yet, looking at his calm and\npassionless countenance, you could not have divined the depth of his\nanguish, for in his present critical situation he did not betray the\nextent of his misfortunes. He felt that he ought to set an example of\nfortitude to his wife and his companions, as being the husband and\nchief. Moreover, he was ready to die first for the common safety, if\ncircumstances should require it.\n\n[Sidenote: CHIEFS, CIVILIZED AND UNCIVILIZED.]\n\nHis companions were worthy of him; they shared his noble thoughts, and\ntheir calm and haughty appearance would scarcely have intimated that\nthey were being carried away to captivity and suffering. By common\nconsent, at Glenarvan's suggestion, they had resolved to feign a proud\nindifference in the presence of the savages. It was the only way of\ninfluencing those fierce natures.\n\n[Illustration: A boat might have been seen ascending the Waikato. It\nwas a canoe seventy feet long and five broad.]\n\nSince leaving the encampment, the natives, taciturn like all savages,\nhad scarcely spoken to each other. However, from a few words exchanged,\nGlenarvan perceived that they were acquainted with the English\nlanguage. He therefore resolved to question the chief in regard to the\nfate that was in store for them. Addressing Kai-Koumou, he said, in a\nfearless tone:\n\n\"Where are you taking us, chief?\"\n\nKai-Koumou gazed at him coldly without answering.\n\n\"Say, what do you expect to do with us?\" continued Glenarvan.\n\nThe chief's eyes blazed with a sudden light, and in a stern voice he\nreplied:\n\n\"To exchange you, if your friends will ransom you; to kill you, if they\nrefuse.\"\n\nGlenarvan asked no more, but hope returned to his heart. Doubtless,\nsome chiefs of the Maori tribe had fallen into the hands of the\nEnglish, and the natives would attempt to recover them by way of\nexchange; their situation, therefore, was not one for despair.\n\nMeantime the canoe rapidly ascended the river. Paganel, whose\nchangeable disposition carried him from one extreme to another, had\nregained his hopefulness. He believed that the Maoris were sparing them\nthe fatigue of their journey to the English settlements, a"}, {"chunk_id": 194, "text": "\nshoulders and surveyed the fortification.

Kai-Koumou came out of his house, and, surrounded by\nthe principal warriors of his tribe, took his place on a mound several\nfeet high in the centre of the fortification. The crowd of natives\nformed a semicircle around him, and the whole assembly preserved\nabsolute silence.\n\nAt a sign from the chief, a warrior advanced towards the temple.\n\n\"Remember!\" said Lady Helena to her husband.\n\nGlenarvan clasped his wife to his heart. At this moment Mary Grant\napproached John Mangles.\n\n\"Lord and Lady Glenarvan,\" said she, \"I think that, if a wife can die\nby the hand of her husband to escape a degrading existence, a maiden\ncan likewise die by the hand of her lover. John (for I may tell you\nat this critical moment), have I not long been your betrothed in the\ndepths of your heart? May I rely upon you, dear John, as Lady Helena\ndoes upon Lord Glenarvan?\"\n\n\"Mary!\" cried the young captain, in terror. \"Ah! dear Mary----\"\n\nHe could not finish: the mat was raised, and the captives were dragged\ntowards Kai-Koumou. The two women were resigned to their fate, while\nthe men concealed their anguish beneath a calmness that showed\nsuperhuman self-control. They came before the chief, who did not delay\nsentence.\n\n\"You killed Kara-Tété!\" said he to Glenarvan.\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n[Sidenote: THE BEGINNING OF THE END.]\n\n\"You shall die to-morrow at sunrise.\"\n\n\"Alone?\" inquired Glenarvan, whose heart beat quickly.\n\n\"What! as if our Tohonga's life were not more precious than yours!\"\ncried Kai-Koumou, whose eyes expressed a fierce regret.\n\nAt this moment a commotion took place among the natives. Glenarvan cast\na rapid glance around him. The crowd opened, and a warrior, dripping\nwith sweat and overcome with fatigue, appeared.\n\nAs soon as Kai-Koumou perceived him, he said in English, evidently that\nhe might be understood by the captives:\n\n\"You come from the camp of the pale-faces?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the Maori.\n\n\"You saw the prisoner, our Tohonga?\"\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n\"Is he living?\"\n\n\"He is dead! The English have shot him.\"\n\nThe fate of Glenarvan and his companions was settled.\n\n\"You shall all die to-morrow at daybreak!\" cried Kai-Koumou.\n\nThe unfortunates were therefore to suffer a common death. Lady Helena\nand Mary Grant raised towards heaven a look of thankfulness.\n\nThe captives were not taken back to the temple. They were to attend\nthat day the funeral of the dead chief, and the bloody ceremonies\nconnected therewith. A party of natives conducted them to the foot of\nan enormous koudi, where these guardians remained without losing sight\nof their prisoners. The rest of the tribe, absorbed in their official\nmourning, seemed to have forgotten them.\n\nThe customary three days had elapsed since the death of Kara-Tété. The\nsoul of the deceased had therefore forever abandoned its mortal abode.\nThe sacred rites began.\n\nThe body was carried to a small mound in the centre of the\nfortification, clothed in splendid costume, and enveloped in a\nmagnificent flaxen mat. The head was adorned with plumes, and wore a\ncrown of green leaves. The face, arms, and breast had been rubbed with\noil, and therefore showed no mortification.\n\nThe parents and friends of the deceased came to the foot of the\nmound, and all at once, as if some director were beating time to a\nfuneral dirge, a great concert of cries, groans, and sobs arose on the\nair. They mourned the dead in plaintive and modulated cadences. His\nrelations struck their heads together; his kinswomen lacerated their\nfaces with their nails, and showed themselves more lavish of blood than\nof tears. These unfortunate females conscientiously fulfilled their\nbarbarous duty.\n\nBut these demonstrations were not enough to appease the soul of the\ndeceased, whose wrath would doubtless hav"}, {"chunk_id": 16, "text": "lk straight.\"\n\n\"Be easy, my boy,\" replied Glenarvan, without adding that the use of\nthe \"cat-o'-nine-tails\" was prohibited, and moreover quite needless, on\nboard the Duncan.\n\n[Sidenote: GLASGOW GOSSIP.]\n\nTo complete the roll of the passengers, it will be sufficient to\ndescribe Major MacNabb. The major was a man of fifty, of calm,\nregular features, who did as he was bid; of an excellent and superior\ncharacter, modest, taciturn, peaceable, and mild; always agreeing\nwith anything or any one, disputing nothing, and neither contradicting\nhimself nor exaggerating. He would mount with measured step the\nstaircase to his bed-chamber, even were a cannon-ball behind him; and\nprobably to his dying day would never find an opportunity to fly into a\npassion.\n\nThis man possessed, in a high degree, not only the common courage of\nthe battle-field (that physical bravery due only to nervous strength),\nbut, better still, moral courage, that is to say, firmness of soul. If\nhe had a fault, it was that of being absolutely Scotch from head to\nfoot, a pure-blooded Caledonian, an infatuated observer of the ancient\ncustoms of his country. Through his relationship to the Glenarvans he\nlived at Malcolm Castle; and as major and military man it was very\nnatural that he should be found on board the Duncan.\n\nSuch, then, were the passengers of this yacht, summoned by unforeseen\ncircumstances to accomplish one of the most surprising voyages of\nmodern times. Since her arrival at the wharf at Glasgow, she had\nmonopolized the public attention. A considerable number came every day\nto visit her. They were interested in her alone, and spoke only of her,\nto the great umbrage of the other captains of the port, among others\nCaptain Burton, commanding the Scotia, a magnificent steamer, moored\nbeside the Duncan, and bound for Calcutta. The Scotia, from her size,\nhad a right to consider the Duncan as a mere fly-boat. Nevertheless,\nall the attraction centred in Lord Glenarvan's yacht, and increased\nfrom day to day.\n\nThe time of departure approached. Captain Mangles had shown himself\nskillful and expeditious. A month after her trial trip in the Frith of\nClyde, the Duncan, laden, provisioned, and equipped, was ready to put\nto sea. The 25th of August was appointed for the time of departure,\nwhich would enable the yacht to reach the southern latitudes by the\nbeginning of spring. Lord Glenarvan, when his plan was matured, did\nnot neglect to make investigations into the hardships and perils of the\nvoyage; yet he did not hesitate on this account, but prepared to leave\nMalcolm Castle.\n\nOn the 24th of August, Lord and Lady Glenarvan, Major MacNabb, Mary and\nRobert Grant, Mr. Olbinett, the steward of the yacht, and his wife, who\nwas in the service of Lady Glenarvan, left the castle, after taking an\naffectionate farewell of their family servants. Several hours afterward\nthey found themselves on board. Many of the population of Glasgow\nwelcomed with sympathetic admiration the young and courageous lady who\nrenounced the pleasures of a life of luxury, and sailed to the rescue\nof the shipwrecked sailors.\n\nThe apartments of Lord Glenarvan and his wife occupied the entire stern\nof the vessel. They consisted of two bed-chambers, a parlor, and two\ndressing-rooms, adjoining which was an open square inclosed by six\ncabins, five of which were occupied by Mary and Robert Grant, Mr. and\nMrs. Olbinett, and Major MacNabb. As for the cabins of the captain and\nthe mate, they were situated in the forecastle, and opened on the deck.\nThe crew were lodged between-decks very comfortably, for the yacht of\ncourse carried nothing but her coal, provisions, and armament.\n\nThe Duncan was to start on the night of the 24th, as the tide fell at\nthree o'clock in the morning. But first those who were present were\nwitness to a touching scene. At eight in the evening Lord Glenarvan and\nhis companions, the entire crew, from the firemen to the captain, all\nwho were to take part in this voyage of sacrifice, left the yacht,"}, {"chunk_id": 191, "text": "ilenced the noisy horde. Glenarvan bowed in token of\nthanks, and slowly resumed his place among his friends.\n\nKai-Koumou, fearing an insurrection of the fanatics of his tribe, now\nled his captives to a sacred place, situated at the other end of the\npah, on the edge of a precipice. This hut rested against a rock that\nrose a hundred feet above it and was a steep boundary to this side of\nthe fortification. In this consecrated temple the priests, or \"arikis,\"\ninstruct the New Zealanders. The building was spacious and tightly\nclosed, and contained the holy and chosen food of the god.\n\nHere the prisoners, temporarily sheltered from the fury of the natives,\nstretched themselves on the flax mats. Lady Helena, her strength\nexhausted and her energy overcome, sank into her husband's arms.\nGlenarvan pressed her to his breast, and said:\n\n\"Courage, my dear Helena; Heaven will not forsake us!\"\n\nRobert was scarcely within the hut before he climbed on Wilson's\nshoulders, and succeeded in thrusting his head through an opening\nbetween the roof and the wall, where strings of pipes were hanging.\nFrom this point his view commanded the whole extent of the pah, as far\nas Kai-Koumou's hut.\n\n\"They have gathered around the chief,\" said he, in a low voice. \"They\nare waving their arms, and howling. Kai-Koumou is going to speak.\"\n\nThe boy was silent for a few moments, then continued:\n\n\"Kai-Koumou is speaking. The savages grow calm; they listen.\"\n\n\"This chief,\" said the major, \"has evidently a personal interest in\nprotecting us. He wishes to exchange his prisoners for some chiefs of\nhis tribe. But will his warriors consent?\"\n\n\"Yes, they are listening to him,\" continued Robert. \"They are\ndispersing; some return to their huts,--others leave the fortification.\"\n\n\"Is it really so?\" cried the major.\n\n\"Yes, Mr. MacNabb,\" replied Robert. \"Kai-Koumou remains alone with the\nwarriors that were in the canoe. Ha! one of them is coming towards us!\"\n\n[Illustration: Robert was scarcely within the hut before he climbed\non Wilson's shoulders, and succeeded in thrusting his head through an\nopening.]\n\n\"Get down, Robert,\" said Glenarvan.\n\nAt this moment Lady Helena, who had risen, seized her husband's arm.\n\n\"Edward,\" said she, in a firm voice, \"neither Mary Grant nor I shall\nfall alive into the hands of those savages!\"\n\nAnd, so saying, she presented to her husband a loaded revolver.\n\n\"A weapon!\" exclaimed Glenarvan, whose eyes suddenly brightened.\n\n\"Yes. The Maoris do not search their female prisoners; but this weapon\nis for us, Edward, not for them.\"\n\n\"Glenarvan,\" said MacNabb quickly, \"hide the revolver. It is not time\nyet.\"\n\nThe weapon was immediately concealed in his clothes. The mat that\nclosed the entrance of the hut was raised. A native appeared. He made a\nsign to the captives to follow him. Glenarvan and his companions passed\nthrough the pah, and stopped before Kai-Koumou.\n\nAround him were assembled the principal warriors of his tribe, among\nwhom was seen the chief whose canoe had first joined Kai-Koumou on the\nriver. He was a man of about forty, robust, and of fierce and cruel\naspect. His name was Kara-Tété, which means in the native language\n\"The Irascible.\" Kai-Koumou treated him with some respect, and from\nthe delicacy of his tattooing it was evident that he occupied a high\nrank in his tribe. An observer, however, would have detected a rivalry\nbetween the two chiefs. The major, indeed, perceived that Kara-Tété's\ninfluence surpassed that of Kai-Koumou. They both ruled the powerful\ntribes of the Waikato with equal rank; and, during this interview,\nalthough Kai-Koumou smiled, his eyes betrayed a deep hostility.\n\nHe now questioned Glenarvan.\n\n\"You are English?\" said he.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Glenarvan, without hesitation, for this nationality\nwould probably facilitate an exchange.\n\n[Sidenote: THE RATE OF BARTER.]\n\n\"And your companions?\" asked Kai-Koumou.\n\n\"My companions are also English. We are shipwrecked travelers, and, if\nyou care to know, we have taken no part in the war"}]}

What,\nmoreover, could ten defenceless men do against thirty well-armed\nsavages? Besides, Glenarvan thought it likely that Kai-Koumou's tribe\nhad lost some chief of high rank whom they were particularly anxious to\nrecover; and he was not mistaken.\n\nThe next day the canoe ascended the river with increased swiftness.\nIt stopped for a moment at the junction of a small river which wound\nacross the plains on the right bank. Here another canoe, with ten\nnatives on board, joined Kai-Koumou. The warriors merely exchanged\nsalutations, and then continued their course. The new-comers had\nrecently fought against the English troops, as could be seen by their\ntattered garments, their gory weapons, and the wounds that still bled\nbeneath their rags. They were gloomy and taciturn, and, with the\nindifference common to all savage races, paid no attention to the\ncaptives.\n\nTowards evening Kai-Koumou landed at the foot of the mountains,\nwhose nearer ridges reached precipitously to the river-bank. Here\ntwenty natives, who had disembarked from their canoes, were making\npreparations for the night. Fires blazed beneath the trees. A chief,\nequal in rank to Kai-Koumou, advanced with measured pace, and, rubbing\nhis nose against that of the latter, saluted him cordially. The\nprisoners were stationed in the centre of the encampment, and guarded\nwith extreme vigilance.\n\nThe next morning the ascent of the Waikato was resumed. Other boats\ncame from various affluents of the river. Sixty warriors, evidently\nfugitives from the last insurrection, had now assembled, and were\nreturning, more or less wounded in the fray, to the mountain districts.\nSometimes a song arose from the canoes, as they advanced in single\nfile. One native struck up the patriotic ode of the mysterious \"Pihé,\"\nthe national hymn that calls the Maoris to battle. The full and\nsonorous voice of the singer waked the echoes of the mountains; and\nafter each stanza his comrades struck their breasts, and sang the\nwarlike verses in chorus. Then they seized their oars again, and the\ncanoes were headed up stream.\n\nDuring the day a singular sight enlivened the voyage. About four\no'clock the canoe, without lessening its speed, guided by the steady\nhand of the chief, dashed through a narrow gorge. Eddies broke\nviolently against numerous small islands, which rendered navigation\nexceeding dangerous. Never could it be more hazardous to capsize, for\nthe banks afforded no refuge, and whoever had set foot on the porous\ncrust of the shore would probably have perished. At this point the\nriver flowed between warm springs, oxide of iron colored the muddy\nground a brilliant red, and not a yard of firm earth could be seen.\nThe air was heavy with a penetrating sulphureous odor. The natives did\nnot regard it, but the captives were seriously annoyed by the noxious\nvapors exhaled from the fissures of the soil and the bubbles that\nburst and discharged their gaseous contents. Yet, however disagreeable\nthese emanations were, the eye could not but admire this magnificent\nspectacle.\n\n[Illustration: At this point the river flowed between warm springs, and\nnot a yard of firm earth could be seen.]\n\nThe canoes soon after entered a dense cloud of white smoke, whose\nwreaths rose in gradually decreasing circles above the river. On the\nshores a hundred geysers, some shooting forth masses of vapor, and\nothers overflowing in liquid columns, varied their effects, like the\njets and cascades of a fountain. It seemed as though some engineer was\ndirecting at his pleasure the outflowings of these springs, as the\nwaters and vapor, mingling in the air, formed rainbows in the sunbeams.\n\nFor two miles the canoes glided within this vapory atmosphere,\nenveloped in its warm waves that rolled along the surface of the water.\nThen the sulphureous smoke disappeared, and a pure swift current of\nfresh air refreshed the panting voyagers. The region of the springs was\npassed.

He accordingly consulted an old\ndervish, who told him that happiness was a very difficult thing to\nfind in this world. 'However,' added he, 'I know an infallible way\nto procure you happiness.' 'What is it?' inquired the young prince.\n'It is,' replied the dervish, 'to put on the shirt of a happy man.'\nThereupon the prince embraced the old man, and set out in search of his\ntalisman. He visited all the capitals of the earth; he tried the shirts\nof kings, emperors, princes, and nobles; but it was a useless task, he\nwas no happier. Then he put on the shirts of artists, warriors, and\nmerchants, but with no more success. He had thus traveled far, without\nfinding happiness. At last, desperate from having tried so many shirts,\nhe was returning very sadly one beautiful day to the palace of his\nfather, when he spied in the field an honest laborer, who was joyously\nsinging as he ploughed. 'Here is, at all events, a man who possesses\nhappiness,' said he to himself, 'or happiness does not exist on earth.'\nHe approached him. 'Good man,' said he, 'are you happy?' 'Yes,' replied\nthe other. 'You wish for nothing?' 'No.' 'You would not change your lot\nfor that of a king?' 'Never!' 'Well, sell me your shirt!' 'My shirt! I\nhave none!'\"\n\n[Illustration: They were agreed on this point, that it was necessary to\nhave courage for every fortune, and be contented with a tree when one\nhas neither palace nor cottage.]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV.\n\nBETWEEN FIRE AND WATER.\n\n\nJacques Paganel's story had a very great success. He was greatly\napplauded, but each retained his own opinion, and the geographer\nobtained the result common to most discussions,--of convincing nobody.\nHowever, they were agreed on this point, that it was necessary to have\ncourage for every fortune, and be contented with a tree when one has\nneither palace nor cottage.\n\nDuring the course of this confabulation evening had come on. Only a\ngood sleep could thoroughly refresh, after this eventful day. The\ninmates of the tree felt themselves not only fatigued by the sudden\nchanges of the inundation, but especially overcome by the heat, which\nhad been excessive. Their feathered companions had already set the\nexample; the hilgueros, those nightingales of the Pampas, had ceased\ntheir melodious warblings, and all the birds had disappeared in the\nrecesses of the foliage. The best plan was to imitate them.\n\nBut before \"retiring to their nest,\" as Paganel said, Glenarvan,\nRobert, and he climbed to the observatory, to examine for the last\ntime the watery expanse. It was about nine o'clock. The sun had just\nset in the sparkling mists of the horizon, and all the western part\nof the firmament was bathed in a warm vapor. The constellations,\nusually so dazzling, seemed veiled in a soft haze. Still they could\nbe distinguished, and Paganel pointed out to Robert, for Glenarvan's\nbenefit, that zone where the stars are most brilliant.\n\n[Sidenote: PHILOSOPHY AND PONCHOS.]\n\nWhile the geographer was discoursing thus, the whole eastern horizon\nassumed a stormy aspect. A dense and dark band, clearly defined,\ngradually rose, dimming the light of the stars. This cloud of\nthreatening appearance soon invaded almost the entire vault of the sky.\nIts motive power must have been inherent in itself, for there was not\na breath of wind. Not a leaf stirred on the tree, not a ripple curled\nthe surface of the waters. Even the air seemed to fail, as if some\nhuge pneumatic machine had rarefied it. A strong electric current was\nperceptible in the atmosphere, and every creature felt it course along\nthe nerves. Glenarvan, Paganel, and Robert were sensibly affected by\nthese electric currents.\n\n\"We shal"}, {"chunk_id": 195, "text": "or were beating time to a\nfuneral dirge, a great concert of cries, groans, and sobs arose on the\nair. They mourned the dead in plaintive and modulated cadences. His\nrelations struck their heads together; his kinswomen lacerated their\nfaces with their nails, and showed themselves more lavish of blood than\nof tears. These unfortunate females conscientiously fulfilled their\nbarbarous duty.\n\nBut these demonstrations were not enough to appease the soul of the\ndeceased, whose wrath would doubtless have smitten the survivors of his\ntribe; and his warriors, as they could not recall him to life, wished\nthat he should have no cause to regret in the other world the happiness\nof this.\n\nKara-Tété's wife was not to forsake her husband in the tomb. Moreover,\nthe unfortunate woman would not have been allowed to survive him;\nit was the custom, in accordance with duty, and examples of such\nsacrifices are not wanting in New Zealand history. The woman appeared.\nShe was still young. Her hair floated in disorder over her shoulders.\nVague words, lamentations, and broken phrases, in which she celebrated\nthe virtues of the dead, interrupted her groans; and, in a final\nparoxysm of grief, she stretched herself at the foot of the mound,\nbeating the ground with her head.\n\nAt this moment Kai-Koumou approached her. Suddenly the unfortunate\nvictim rose; but a violent blow with the \"méré,\" a formidable club,\nwielded by the hand of the chief, struck her lifeless to the earth.\n\n[Sidenote: POOR HUMANITY!]\n\nFrightful cries at once broke forth. A hundred arms threatened the\ncaptives, who trembled at the horrible sight. But no one stirred, for\nthe funeral ceremonies were not ended.\n\nKara-Tété's wife had joined her husband in the other world. Both bodies\nlay side by side. But for the eternal life his faithful spouse could\nnot alone suffice the deceased. Who would serve them in presence of\nNouï-Atoua, if their slaves did not follow them?\n\nSix unfortunates were brought before the corpse of their master and\nmistress. They were servants, whom the pitiless laws of war had reduced\nto slavery. During the life of the chief they had undergone the\nseverest privations, suffered a thousand abuses, had been scantily fed,\nand compelled constantly to labor like beasts; and now, according to\nthe Maori belief, they were to continue their existence of servitude\nfor eternity.\n\nThey appeared to be resigned to their fate, and were not astonished\nat a sacrifice they had long anticipated. Their freedom from all\nbonds showed that they would meet death unresistingly. Moreover, this\ndeath was rapid, protracted sufferings were spared them. These were\nreserved for the captives who stood trembling not twenty paces distant.\nSix blows of the méré, given by six stalwart warriors, stretched the\nvictims on the ground in a pool of blood. It was the signal for a\nterrible scene of cannibalism, which followed in all its horrible\ndetails.\n\nGlenarvan and his companions, breathless with fright, strove to hide\nthis awful scene from the eyes of the two unhappy ladies. They now\nunderstood what awaited them at sunrise the next day, and what cruel\ntortures would doubtless precede such a death. They were dumb with\nhorror.\n\nThe funeral dance now began. Strong spirits, extracted from an\nindigenous plant, maddened the savages till they seemed no longer\nhuman. Would they not forget the taboo of the chief, and throw\nthemselves in their final outbreaks upon the prisoners who trembled at\ntheir frenzy?\n\n[Illustration: A terrible scene of cannibalism, which followed in all\nits horrible details.]\n\n[Illustration: The corpses, folded together, in a sitting posture,\nand tied in their clothes by a girdle of withes, were placed on this\nprimitive bier.]\n\nBut Kai-Koumou had preserved his reason in the midst of the general\nintoxication.

A few moments after\nthey were led back to the temple that served as their prison; but\nRobert Grant and Paganel were no longer with them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER L.\n\nTHE CHIEF'S FUNERAL.\n\n\nKai-Koumou, according to a custom quite ordinary in New Zealand, joined\nthe rank of priest to that of chief, and could, therefore, extend to\npersons or objects the superstitious protection of the taboo.\n\nThe taboo, which is common to the tribes of Polynesia, has the power\nto prohibit at once all connection with the object or person tabooed.\nAccording to the Maori religion, whoever should lay his sacrilegious\nhand on what is declared taboo would be punished with death by the\noffended god; and in case the divinity should delay to avenge his own\ninsult, the priests would not fail to excite his anger.\n\nAs for the prisoners confined in the temple, the taboo had rescued\nthem from the fury of the tribe. Some of the natives, the friends and\npartisans of Kai-Koumou, had stopped suddenly at the command of their\nchief, and had protected the captives.\n\n[Sidenote: THE TORTURES OF SUSPENSE.]\n\nGlenarvan, however, was not blind to the fate that was reserved for\nhim. Only his death could atone for the murder of a chief. Among savage\nraces death is always preceded by a protracted torture. He therefore\nexpected to cruelly expiate the righteous indignation that had nerved\nhis arm, but hoped that Kai-Koumou's rage would fall only on himself.\n\nWhat a night he and his companions passed! Who could depict their\nanguish, or measure their sufferings? Neither poor Robert nor brave\nPaganel had reappeared. But how could they doubt their fate? Were they\nnot the first victims of the natives' vengeance? All hope had vanished\neven from the heart of the major, who did not easily despair. John\nMangles felt himself growing mad at sight of the sad dejection of Mary\nGrant, thus separated from her brother. Glenarvan thought of that\nterrible request of Lady Helena, who, rather than yield to torture or\nslavery, preferred to die by his hand. Could he summon this fearful\ncourage? As for an escape, that was plainly impossible. Ten warriors,\narmed to the teeth, guarded the entrance of the temple.\n\nMorning came at last. There had been no communication between the\nnatives and the prisoners. The hut contained a considerable quantity\nof food, which the unfortunates scarcely touched. Hunger gave place to\ngrief. The day passed without bringing a change or a hope. Doubtless\nthe hour for the dead chief's funeral and their torture would be the\nsame.\n\nHowever, although Glenarvan concluded that Kai-Koumou must have\nabandoned all idea of exchange, the major on this point retained a\ngleam of hope.\n\n\"Who knows,\" said he, reminding Glenarvan of the effect produced upon\nthe chief by the death of Kara-Tété,--\"who knows but that Kai-Koumou in\nreality feels obliged to you?\"\n\nBut, in spite of these observations, Glenarvan would no longer hope.\nThe next day also passed away without the preparations for torture\nbeing made. The reason of the delay was this.\n\nThe Maoris believe that the soul, for three days after death, inhabits\nthe body of the deceased, and therefore during this time the corpse\nremains unburied. This custom was rigorously observed, and for two days\nthe pah was deserted. Captain Mangles frequently stood on Wilson's\nshoulders and surveyed the fortification. No native was seen; only the\nsentinels guarded in turn at the door of their prison.\n\nBut on the third day the huts were opened. The savages, men, women,\nand children, to the number of several hundreds, assembled in the pah,\nsilent and calm. Kai-Koumou came out of his house, and, surrounded by\nthe principal warriors of his tribe, took his place on a mound several\nfeet high in the centre of the fortification. The crowd of natives\nformed a semicircle aroun"}, {"chunk_id": 196, "text": "scene of cannibalism, which followed in all\nits horrible details.]\n\n[Illustration: The corpses, folded together, in a sitting posture,\nand tied in their clothes by a girdle of withes, were placed on this\nprimitive bier.]\n\nBut Kai-Koumou had preserved his reason in the midst of the general\nintoxication. He allowed this bloody orgy an hour to reach its utmost\nintensity. The last act of the funeral was played with the usual rites.\n\nThe bodies of Kara-Tété and his wife were taken up, and their limbs\nbent and gathered against the stomach, according to the New Zealand\ncustom. The place for the tomb had been chosen outside of the\nfortification, about two miles distant, on the summit of a small\nmountain, called Maunganamu, situated on the right shore of the lake.\n\nThither the bodies were to be carried. Two very rude palanquins, or\nrather litters, were brought to the foot of the mound. The corpses,\nfolded together, in a sitting posture, and tied in their clothes by a\ngirdle of withes, were placed on this primitive bier. Four warriors\nbore it between them, and the entire tribe, chanting the funeral hymn,\nfollowed them in procession to the place of burial.\n\nThe captives, who were always watched, saw them leave the inner\ninclosure of the pah, and then the songs and cries gradually died away.\nFor about half an hour this funeral escort continued in sight, in the\ndepths of the valley. Finally they perceived it again winding along\nthe mountain paths. The distance gave a fantastic appearance to the\nundulating movements of the long, sinuous column.\n\nThe tribe stopped at the summit of the mountain, which was eight\nhundred feet high, at the place prepared for Kara-Tété's interment.\nA common Maori would have had only a hole and a heap of stones for a\ngrave; but for a powerful and dreaded chief, destined doubtless for a\nspeedy deification, a tomb worthy of his exploits was reserved.\n\n[Sidenote: THE LAST NIGHT.]\n\nThe sepulchre had been surrounded by palisades, while stakes,\nornamented with faces reddened with ochre, stood beside the grave\nwhere the bodies were to lie. The relatives had not forgotten that the\n\"waidoua\" (the spirit of the dead) feeds on substantial nourishment\nlike the body during this perishable life. Food had therefore been\ndeposited in the inclosure, together with the weapons and clothes of\nthe deceased.\n\nNothing was wanting for the comfort of the tomb. Husband and wife were\nlaid side by side, and then covered with earth and grass after a series\nof renewed lamentations. Then the procession silently descended the\nmountain, and now no one could ascend it under penalty of death, for it\nwas tabooed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LI.\n\nSTRANGELY LIBERATED.\n\n\nJust as the sun was disappearing behind Lake Taupo, the captives were\nled back to their prison. They were not to leave it again until the\nsummit of the Wahiti mountains should kindle with the first beams of\nthe day. One night remained to prepare for death. In spite of the\nfaintness, in spite of the horror with which they were seized, they\nshared their repast in common.\n\n\"We shall need all the strength possible to face death,\" said\nGlenarvan. \"We must show these barbarians how Europeans and Christians\ncan die.\"\n\nThe meal being finished, Lady Helena repeated the evening prayer aloud,\nwhile all her companions, with uncovered heads, joined her. Having\nfulfilled this duty, and enjoyed this privilege, the prisoners embraced\neach other. Lady Helena and Mary Grant then retired to one corner of\nthe hut, and stretched themselves upon a mat. Sleep, which soothes all\nwoes, soon closed their eyes, and they slumbered in each other's arms,\novercome by fatigue and long wakefulness.\n\nGlenarvan, taking his friends aside, said:\n\n\"My dear companions, our lives and those of these poor ladies are in\nGod's hands. If Heaven has decreed that we shall die to-morrow, we can,\nI am sure, die like brave people, like Christians, ready to appear\nfearlessly before the final Judge.

These unfortunate females conscientiously fulfilled their\nbarbarous duty.\n\nBut these demonstrations were not enough to appease the soul of the\ndeceased, whose wrath would doubtless have smitten the survivors of his\ntribe; and his warriors, as they could not recall him to life, wished\nthat he should have no cause to regret in the other world the happiness\nof this.\n\nKara-Tété's wife was not to forsake her husband in the tomb. Moreover,\nthe unfortunate woman would not have been allowed to survive him;\nit was the custom, in accordance with duty, and examples of such\nsacrifices are not wanting in New Zealand history. The woman appeared.\nShe was still young. Her hair floated in disorder over her shoulders.\nVague words, lamentations, and broken phrases, in which she celebrated\nthe virtues of the dead, interrupted her groans; and, in a final\nparoxysm of grief, she stretched herself at the foot of the mound,\nbeating the ground with her head.\n\nAt this moment Kai-Koumou approached her. Suddenly the unfortunate\nvictim rose; but a violent blow with the \"méré,\" a formidable club,\nwielded by the hand of the chief, struck her lifeless to the earth.\n\n[Sidenote: POOR HUMANITY!]\n\nFrightful cries at once broke forth. A hundred arms threatened the\ncaptives, who trembled at the horrible sight. But no one stirred, for\nthe funeral ceremonies were not ended.\n\nKara-Tété's wife had joined her husband in the other world. Both bodies\nlay side by side. But for the eternal life his faithful spouse could\nnot alone suffice the deceased. Who would serve them in presence of\nNouï-Atoua, if their slaves did not follow them?\n\nSix unfortunates were brought before the corpse of their master and\nmistress. They were servants, whom the pitiless laws of war had reduced\nto slavery. During the life of the chief they had undergone the\nseverest privations, suffered a thousand abuses, had been scantily fed,\nand compelled constantly to labor like beasts; and now, according to\nthe Maori belief, they were to continue their existence of servitude\nfor eternity.\n\nThey appeared to be resigned to their fate, and were not astonished\nat a sacrifice they had long anticipated. Their freedom from all\nbonds showed that they would meet death unresistingly. Moreover, this\ndeath was rapid, protracted sufferings were spared them. These were\nreserved for the captives who stood trembling not twenty paces distant.\nSix blows of the méré, given by six stalwart warriors, stretched the\nvictims on the ground in a pool of blood. It was the signal for a\nterrible scene of cannibalism, which followed in all its horrible\ndetails.\n\nGlenarvan and his companions, breathless with fright, strove to hide\nthis awful scene from the eyes of the two unhappy ladies. They now\nunderstood what awaited them at sunrise the next day, and what cruel\ntortures would doubtless precede such a death. They were dumb with\nhorror.\n\nThe funeral dance now began. Strong spirits, extracted from an\nindigenous plant, maddened the savages till they seemed no longer\nhuman. Would they not forget the taboo of the chief, and throw\nthemselves in their final outbreaks upon the prisoners who trembled at\ntheir frenzy?\n\n[Illustration: A terrible scene of cannibalism, which followed in all\nits horrible details.]\n\n[Illustration: The corpses, folded together, in a sitting posture,\nand tied in their clothes by a girdle of withes, were placed on this\nprimitive bier.]\n\nBut Kai-Koumou had preserved his reason in the midst of the general\nintoxication. He allowed this bloody orgy an hour to reach its utmost\nintensity. The last act of the funeral was played with the usual rites.\n\nThe bodies of Kara-Tété and his wife were taken up, and their limbs"}, {"chunk_id": 188, "text": "event, such a\ntransaction; but still it was better to await the result. What,\nmoreover, could ten defenceless men do against thirty well-armed\nsavages? Besides, Glenarvan thought it likely that Kai-Koumou's tribe\nhad lost some chief of high rank whom they were particularly anxious to\nrecover; and he was not mistaken.\n\nThe next day the canoe ascended the river with increased swiftness.\nIt stopped for a moment at the junction of a small river which wound\nacross the plains on the right bank. Here another canoe, with ten\nnatives on board, joined Kai-Koumou. The warriors merely exchanged\nsalutations, and then continued their course. The new-comers had\nrecently fought against the English troops, as could be seen by their\ntattered garments, their gory weapons, and the wounds that still bled\nbeneath their rags. They were gloomy and taciturn, and, with the\nindifference common to all savage races, paid no attention to the\ncaptives.\n\nTowards evening Kai-Koumou landed at the foot of the mountains,\nwhose nearer ridges reached precipitously to the river-bank. Here\ntwenty natives, who had disembarked from their canoes, were making\npreparations for the night. Fires blazed beneath the trees. A chief,\nequal in rank to Kai-Koumou, advanced with measured pace, and, rubbing\nhis nose against that of the latter, saluted him cordially. The\nprisoners were stationed in the centre of the encampment, and guarded\nwith extreme vigilance.\n\nThe next morning the ascent of the Waikato was resumed. Other boats\ncame from various affluents of the river. Sixty warriors, evidently\nfugitives from the last insurrection, had now assembled, and were\nreturning, more or less wounded in the fray, to the mountain districts.\nSometimes a song arose from the canoes, as they advanced in single\nfile. One native struck up the patriotic ode of the mysterious \"Pihé,\"\nthe national hymn that calls the Maoris to battle. The full and\nsonorous voice of the singer waked the echoes of the mountains; and\nafter each stanza his comrades struck their breasts, and sang the\nwarlike verses in chorus. Then they seized their oars again, and the\ncanoes were headed up stream.\n\nDuring the day a singular sight enlivened the voyage. About four\no'clock the canoe, without lessening its speed, guided by the steady\nhand of the chief, dashed through a narrow gorge. Eddies broke\nviolently against numerous small islands, which rendered navigation\nexceeding dangerous. Never could it be more hazardous to capsize, for\nthe banks afforded no refuge, and whoever had set foot on the porous\ncrust of the shore would probably have perished. At this point the\nriver flowed between warm springs, oxide of iron colored the muddy\nground a brilliant red, and not a yard of firm earth could be seen.\nThe air was heavy with a penetrating sulphureous odor. The natives did\nnot regard it, but the captives were seriously annoyed by the noxious\nvapors exhaled from the fissures of the soil and the bubbles that\nburst and discharged their gaseous contents. Yet, however disagreeable\nthese emanations were, the eye could not but admire this magnificent\nspectacle.\n\n[Illustration: At this point the river flowed between warm springs, and\nnot a yard of firm earth could be seen.]\n\nThe canoes soon after entered a dense cloud of white smoke, whose\nwreaths rose in gradually decreasing circles above the river. On the\nshores a hundred geysers, some shooting forth masses of vapor, and\nothers overflowing in liquid columns, varied their effects, like the\njets and cascades of a fountain. It seemed as though some engineer was\ndirecting at his pleasure the outflowings of these springs, as the\nwaters and vapor, mingling in the air, formed rainbows in the sunbeams.\n\nFor two miles the canoes glided within this vapory atmosphere,\nenveloped in its warm waves that rolled along the surface of the water.\nThen the sulphureous smoke disappeared, and a pure swift current of\nfresh air refreshed the panting voyagers. The region of the springs was\npassed. Before the cl"}]}

In my opinion this man's\nreal name is Ayrton. Ben Joyce is his fighting title. It is certain\nthat he knows Harry Grant, and has been quartermaster on board the\nBritannia. These facts, proved already by the precise details given\nby Ayrton, are still further corroborated by the conversation of the\nconvicts that I have related. Let us not, therefore, be led astray\nby vain conjectures, but only be certain that Ayrton is Ben Joyce, a\nsailor of the Britannia, now chief of a band of convicts.\"\n\nThe major's explanation was accepted as conclusive.\n\n\"Now,\" replied Glenarvan, \"will you tell me how and why Harry Grant's\nquartermaster is in Australia?\"\n\n\"How, I do not know,\" said MacNabb; \"and the police declare they know\nno more than I on the subject. Why, it is also impossible for me to\nsay. Here is a mystery that the future will explain.\"\n\n\"The police do not even know the identity of Ayrton and Ben Joyce,\"\nsaid Captain Mangles.\n\n\"You are right, John,\" replied the major; \"and such information would\nbe likely to facilitate their search.\"\n\n\"This unfortunate, then,\" remarked Lady Helena, \"intruded into\nO'Moore's farm with a criminal intention?\"\n\n\"There is no doubt of it,\" continued MacNabb. \"He was meditating\nsome hostile attack upon the Irishman, when a better opportunity was\noffered. Chance threw us in his way. He heard Glenarvan's story of the\nshipwreck, and, like a bold man, he promptly decided to take part in\nthe expedition. At the Wimerra he communicated with one of his friends,\nthe farrier of Black Point, and thus left distinguishable traces of\nour course. His band followed us. A poisonous plant enabled him to\ngradually kill our oxen and horses. Then, at the proper moment, he\nentangled us in the marshes of the Snowy, and surrendered us to the\nconvicts he commanded.\"\n\nEverything possible had been said concerning Ben Joyce. His past had\njust been reviewed by the major, and the wretch appeared as he was,--a\nbold and formidable criminal. His intentions had been clearly proved,\nand required, on the part of Glenarvan, extreme vigilance. Fortunately,\nthere was less to fear from the detected bandit than the secret traitor.\n\nBut one serious fact appeared from this explanation. No one had yet\nthought of it; only Mary Grant, disregarding the past, looked forward\nto the future. Captain Mangles first saw her pale and disconsolate. He\nunderstood what was passing in her mind.\n\n\"Miss Mary!\" cried he, \"you are weeping!\"\n\n\"What is the matter, my child?\" asked Lady Helena.\n\n\"My father, madam, my father!\" replied the young girl.\n\nShe could not continue. But a sudden revelation dawned on the mind of\neach. They comprehended Mary's grief, why the tears flowed from her\neyes, why the "}, {"chunk_id": 217, "text": "What do you mean, Tom?\" inquired Glenarvan.\n\n\"I mean,\" he replied, \"that when the quartermaster, Ayrton, learned,\nthe day after our departure, the Duncan's destination----\"\n\n\"Ayrton!\" cried Glenarvan. \"Is he on board?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord.\"\n\n\"Ayrton here!\" repeated Glenarvan, glancing at Captain Mangles.\n\n\"Wonderful indeed!\" said the young captain.\n\nIn an instant, with the swiftness of lightning, Ayrton's conduct, his\nlong-contrived treachery, Glenarvan's wound, the attack upon Mulready,\ntheir sufferings in the marshes of the Snowy, all the wretch's deeds,\nflashed upon the minds of the two men. And now, by a strange fatality,\nthe convict was in their power.\n\n\"Where is he?\" asked Glenarvan quickly.\n\n\"In a cabin in the forecastle,\" replied Tom Austin, \"closely guarded.\"\n\n\"Why this confinement?\"\n\n[Sidenote: AN UNOFFICIAL TRIBUNAL.]\n\n\"Because, when Ayrton saw that the yacht was sailing for New Zealand,\nhe flew into a passion; because he attempted to force me to change the\nship's course; because he threatened me; and, finally, because he urged\nmy men to a mutiny. I saw that he was a dangerous person, and was\ncompelled, therefore, to take precautions against him.\"\n\n\"And since that time?\"\n\n\"Since that time he has been in his cabin, without offering to come\nout.\"\n\n\"Good!\"\n\nAt this moment Glenarvan and Captain Mangles were summoned to the\nsaloon. Breakfast, which they so much needed, was ready. They took\nseats at the table, but did not speak of Ayrton.\n\nHowever, when the meal was ended, and the passengers had assembled on\ndeck, Glenarvan informed them of the quartermaster's presence on board.\nAt the same time he declared his intention of sending for him.\n\n\"Can I be released from attending this tribunal?\" asked Lady Helena.\n\"I confess to you, my dear Edward, that the sight of this unfortunate\nwould be very painful to me.\"\n\n\"It is only to confront him, Helena,\" replied Glenarvan. \"Remain,\nif you can. Ben Joyce should see himself face to face with all his\nintended victims.\"\n\nLady Helena yielded to this request, and Mary Grant and she took their\nplaces beside him, while around them stood the major, Paganel, Captain\nMangles, Robert, Wilson, Mulready, and Olbinett, all who had suffered\nso severely by the convict's treason. The crew of the yacht, who did\nnot yet understand the seriousness of these proceedings, maintained a\nprofound silence.\n\n\"Call Ayrton!\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVI.\n\nAYRTON'S OBSTINACY.\n\n\nAyrton soon made his appearance. He crossed the deck with a confident\nstep, and ascended the poop-stairs. His eyes had a sullen look, his\nteeth were set, and his fists clinched convulsively. His bearing\ndisplayed neither exultation nor humility. As soon as he was in Lord\nGlenarvan's presence, he folded his arms, and calmly and silently\nwaited to be questioned:\n\n\"Ayrton,\" said Glenarvan, \"here we all are, as you see, on board the\nDuncan, that you would have surrendered to Ben Joyce's accomplices.\"\n\nAt these words the lips of the quartermaster slightly trembled. A quick\nblush colored his hard features,--not the sign of remorse, but the\nshame of defeat. He was prisoner on this yacht that he had meant to\ncommand as master, and his fate was soon to be decided.\n\nHowever, he made no reply. Glenarvan waited patiently, but Ayrton still\npersisted in maintaining an obstinate silence.\n\n\"Speak, Ayrton; what have you to say?\" continued Glenarvan.\n\nThe convict hesitated, and the lines of his forehead were strongly\ncontracted. At last he said, in a calm voice:\n\n\"I have nothing to say, my lord. I was foolish enough to let myself be\ntaken. Do what you please.\"\n\n[Sidenote: A DUMB PRISONER.]\n\nHaving given his answer, the quartermaster turned his eyes toward\nthe coast that extended along the west, and affected a profound\nindifference for all that was passing around him. You would have\nthought, to look at him, that he was a stranger to this serious affair.\n\nBut Glenarvan had resolved to be patient. A powerful motive urged\nhim to ascertain certain circumstances o"}, {"chunk_id": 16, "text": "lk straight.\"\n\n\"Be easy, my boy,\" replied Glenarvan, without adding that the use of\nthe \"cat-o'-nine-tails\" was prohibited, and moreover quite needless, on\nboard the Duncan.\n\n[Sidenote: GLASGOW GOSSIP.]\n\nTo complete the roll of the passengers, it will be sufficient to\ndescribe Major MacNabb. The major was a man of fifty, of calm,\nregular features, who did as he was bid; of an excellent and superior\ncharacter, modest, taciturn, peaceable, and mild; always agreeing\nwith anything or any one, disputing nothing, and neither contradicting\nhimself nor exaggerating. He would mount with measured step the\nstaircase to his bed-chamber, even were a cannon-ball behind him; and\nprobably to his dying day would never find an opportunity to fly into a\npassion.\n\nThis man possessed, in a high degree, not only the common courage of\nthe battle-field (that physical bravery due only to nervous strength),\nbut, better still, moral courage, that is to say, firmness of soul. If\nhe had a fault, it was that of being absolutely Scotch from head to\nfoot, a pure-blooded Caledonian, an infatuated observer of the ancient\ncustoms of his country. Through his relationship to the Glenarvans he\nlived at Malcolm Castle; and as major and military man it was very\nnatural that he should be found on board the Duncan.\n\nSuch, then, were the passengers of this yacht, summoned by unforeseen\ncircumstances to accomplish one of the most surprising voyages of\nmodern times. Since her arrival at the wharf at Glasgow, she had\nmonopolized the public attention. A considerable number came every day\nto visit her. They were interested in her alone, and spoke only of her,\nto the great umbrage of the other captains of the port, among others\nCaptain Burton, commanding the Scotia, a magnificent steamer, moored\nbeside the Duncan, and bound for Calcutta. The Scotia, from her size,\nhad a right to consider the Duncan as a mere fly-boat. Nevertheless,\nall the attraction centred in Lord Glenarvan's yacht, and increased\nfrom day to day.\n\nThe time of departure approached. Captain Mangles had shown himself\nskillful and expeditious. A month after her trial trip in the Frith of\nClyde, the Duncan, laden, provisioned, and equipped, was ready to put\nto sea. The 25th of August was appointed for the time of departure,\nwhich would enable the yacht to reach the southern latitudes by the\nbeginning of spring. Lord Glenarvan, when his plan was matured, did\nnot neglect to make investigations into the hardships and perils of the\nvoyage; yet he did not hesitate on this account, but prepared to leave\nMalcolm Castle.\n\nOn the 24th of August, Lord and Lady Glenarvan, Major MacNabb, Mary and\nRobert Grant, Mr. Olbinett, the steward of the yacht, and his wife, who\nwas in the service of Lady Glenarvan, left the castle, after taking an\naffectionate farewell of their family servants. Several hours afterward\nthey found themselves on board. Many of the population of Glasgow\nwelcomed with sympathetic admiration the young and courageous lady who\nrenounced the pleasures of a life of luxury, and sailed to the rescue\nof the shipwrecked sailors.\n\nThe apartments of Lord Glenarvan and his wife occupied the entire stern\nof the vessel. They consisted of two bed-chambers, a parlor, and two\ndressing-rooms, adjoining which was an open square inclosed by six\ncabins, five of which were occupied by Mary and Robert Grant, Mr. and\nMrs. Olbinett, and Major MacNabb. As for the cabins of the captain and\nthe mate, they were situated in the forecastle, and opened on the deck.\nThe crew were lodged between-decks very comfortably, for the yacht of\ncourse carried nothing but her coal, provisions, and armament.\n\nThe Duncan was to start on the night of the 24th, as the tide fell at\nthree o'clock in the morning. But first those who were present were\nwitness to a touching scene. At eight in the evening Lord Glenarvan and\nhis companions, the entire crew, from the firemen to the captain, all\nwho were to take part in this voyage of sacrifice, left the yacht,"}, {"chunk_id": 218, "text": "ave nothing to say, my lord. I was foolish enough to let myself be\ntaken. Do what you please.\"\n\n[Sidenote: A DUMB PRISONER.]\n\nHaving given his answer, the quartermaster turned his eyes toward\nthe coast that extended along the west, and affected a profound\nindifference for all that was passing around him. You would have\nthought, to look at him, that he was a stranger to this serious affair.\n\nBut Glenarvan had resolved to be patient. A powerful motive urged\nhim to ascertain certain circumstances of Ayrton's mysterious life,\nespecially as regarded Harry Grant and the Britannia. He therefore\nresumed his inquiries, speaking with extreme mildness, and imposing the\nmost perfect calmness upon the violent agitation of his heart.\n\n\"I hope, Ayrton,\" continued he, \"that you will not refuse to answer\ncertain questions that I desire to ask you. And, first, am I to call\nyou Ayrton or Ben Joyce? Are you the quartermaster of the Britannia?\"\n\nAyrton remained unmoved, watching the coast, deaf to every question.\nGlenarvan, whose eye flashed with some inward emotion, continued to\nquestion him.\n\n\"Will you tell me how you left the Britannia, and why you were in\nAustralia?\"\n\nThere was the same silence, the same obstinacy.\n\n\"Listen to me, Ayrton,\" resumed Glenarvan. \"It is for your interest to\nspeak. We may reward a frank confession, which is your only resort. For\nthe last time, will you answer my questions?\"\n\nAyrton turned his head towards Glenarvan, and looked him full in the\nface.\n\n\"My lord,\" said he, \"I have nothing to answer. It is for justice to\nprove against me.\"\n\n\"The proofs will be easy,\" replied Glenarvan.\n\n[Sidenote: USELESS APPEALS.]\n\n\"Easy, my lord?\" continued the quartermaster, in a sneering tone.\n\"Your lordship seems to me very hasty. I declare that the best judge\nin Westminster Hall would be puzzled to establish my identity. Who can\nsay why I came to Australia, since Captain Grant is no longer here to\ninform you? Who can prove that I am that Ben Joyce described by the\npolice, since they have never laid hands upon me, and my companions are\nat liberty? Who, except you, can charge me, not to say with a crime,\nbut even with a culpable action?\"\n\n[Illustration: Ayrton soon made his appearance. He crossed the deck\nwith a confident step, and ascended the poop-stairs.]\n\nAyrton had grown animated while speaking, but soon relapsed into his\nformer indifference. He doubtless imagined that this declaration would\nend the examination: but Glenarvan resumed, and said:\n\n\"Ayrton, I am not a judge charged with trying you. This is not my\nbusiness. It is important that our respective positions should be\nclearly defined. I ask nothing that can implicate you, for that is the\npart of justice. But you know what search I am pursuing, and, with a\nword, you can put me on the track I have lost. Will you speak?\"\n\nAyrton shook his head, like a man determined to keep silent.\n\n\"Will you tell me where Captain Grant is?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"No, my lord.\"\n\n\"Will you point out where the Britannia was wrecked?\"\n\n\"Certainly not.\"\n\n\"Ayrton,\" said Glenarvan, in almost a suppliant tone, \"will you, at\nleast, if you know where Captain Grant is, tell his poor children, who\nare only waiting for a word from your lips?\"\n\nThe quartermaster hesitated; his features quivered; but, in a low\nvoice, he muttered:\n\n\"I cannot, my lord.\"\n\nThen, as if he reproached himself for a moment's weakness, he added,\nangrily:\n\n\"No, I will not speak! Hang me if you will!\"\n\n\"Hang, then!\" cried Glenarvan, overcome by a sudden feeling of\nindignation.\n\nBut finally controlling himself, he said, in a grave voice:\n\n\"There are neither judges nor hangmen here. At the first landing-place\nyou shall be put into the hands of the English authorities.\"\n\n\"Just what I desire,\" replied the quartermaster.\n\nThereupon he was taken back to the cabin that served as his prison, and\ntwo sailors were stationed at the door, with orders to watch all his\nmovements. The witnesses of this scene retired indignant and in despair.\n\nSince Gl"}, {"chunk_id": 113, "text": "hed\nthe hospitable dwelling of Mr. O'Moore, where his labor insured him a\ncomfortable livelihood.\n\n\"And if Ayrton is pleased with me,\" said the Irish colonist, when the\nstory was finished, \"I cannot but be pleased with him.

He\nprobably thought, however, that the legitimate curiosity of his hearers\nought to be satisfied. What could he say that had not been repeated\na hundred times already? Glenarvan was, therefore, about to open the\nconversation on a new topic, to profit by the information received from\nAyrton, when the major, addressing him, said:\n\n\"You were quartermaster of the Britannia?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Ayrton.\n\nBut perceiving that a certain feeling of distrust, a doubt, however\nslight, had suggested this inquiry, he added,--\n\n\"I saved my contract from the wreck.\"\n\nHe immediately left the room in search of this authoritative document.\nDuring his absence, which lasted but a few moments, Mr. O'Moore said:\n\n\"My lord, I will answer for it that Ayrton is an honest man. During the\ntwo months that he has been in my employ, I have had no fault to find\nwith him. I knew the story of his shipwreck and captivity. He is a true\nman, and worthy of your entire confidence.\"\n\nGlenarvan was about to answer that he had never doubted Ayrton's\nhonesty, when the latter returned and presented his contract. It was a\npaper signed by the owners of the Britannia and Captain Grant, whose\nwriting Mary recognized immediately. It stated that \"Tom Ayrton, able\nseaman, was engaged as quartermaster on board the brig Britannia of\nGlasgow.\" There was, therefore, no possible doubt of Ayrton's identity,\nfor it would have been difficult to suppose that this contract could be\nin his hands and not belong to him.\n\n[Sidenote: ENTANGLEMENTS.]\n\n\"Now,\" said Glenarvan, \"I appeal to you all for advice as to what is\nbest to be done. Your advice, Ayrton, would be particularly valuable,\nand I should be much obliged if you would give it to us.\"\n\nThe sailor reflected a few moments, and then replied:\n\n\"I thank you, my lord, for the confidence you place in me, and hope to\nshow myself worthy of it. I have some knowledge of the country, and of\nthe customs of the natives; and, if I can be of use to you----\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" replied Glenarvan.\n\n\"I think, like you,\" continued Ayrton, \"that Captain Grant and his two\nsailors were saved from the shipwreck; but, since they have not reached\nthe English possessions, since they have not reappeared, I doubt not\nthat their fate was the same as my own, and that they are prisoners of\nthe natives.\"\n\n\"You repeat, Mr. Ayrton, the arguments that I have already\nsubstantiated,\" said Paganel. \"The shipwrecked seamen are evidently\nprisoners of the natives, as they feared. But ought we to suppose that,\nlike you, they have been carried to the north?\"\n\n\"It is quite likely, sir,\" replied Ayrton. \"The hostile tribes would\nhardly remain in the neighborhood of the English provinces.\"\n\n\"This fact will complicate our search,\" said Glenarvan, quite\ndisconcerted. \"How shall we find the traces of the prisoners in the\ninterior of so vast a continent?\"\n\nA prolonged silence followed this remark. Lady Helena frequently\ncast a questioning glance at her companions, but without eliciting a\nresponsive sign. Paganel himself was silent, contrary to his custom.\nHis usual ingenuity now failed him. Captain Mangles paced the room with\nlong strides, as if he had been on the deck of his vessel, involved in\nsome difficulty.\n\n\"And you, Mr. Ayrton,\" said Lady Helena, at length, to the\nquartermaster, \"what would you do?\"\n\n\"Madam,\" replied he, promptly, \"I should re-embark on board the Duncan,\nand go straight to the place of the shipwreck. There I should act\naccording to circumstances, or indications that chance might furnish.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" said Glenarvan; \"but we must wait till the Duncan is\nrepaired.\"\n\n\"Ah! you"}]}

A poisonous plant enabled him to\ngradually kill our oxen and horses. Then, at the proper moment, he\nentangled us in the marshes of the Snowy, and surrendered us to the\nconvicts he commanded.\"\n\nEverything possible had been said concerning Ben Joyce. His past had\njust been reviewed by the major, and the wretch appeared as he was,--a\nbold and formidable criminal. His intentions had been clearly proved,\nand required, on the part of Glenarvan, extreme vigilance. Fortunately,\nthere was less to fear from the detected bandit than the secret traitor.\n\nBut one serious fact appeared from this explanation. No one had yet\nthought of it; only Mary Grant, disregarding the past, looked forward\nto the future. Captain Mangles first saw her pale and disconsolate. He\nunderstood what was passing in her mind.\n\n\"Miss Mary!\" cried he, \"you are weeping!\"\n\n\"What is the matter, my child?\" asked Lady Helena.\n\n\"My father, madam, my father!\" replied the young girl.\n\nShe could not continue.

That is why I requested the\npresence of Mr. Paganel and Major MacNabb; for, properly speaking, this\nis a matter of business that I am going to propose to you.\"\n\nGlenarvan, who was accustomed to Ayrton's manners, betrayed no\nsurprise, although a matter of business between this man and himself\nseemed strange.\n\n[Illustration: \"Do you agree or not?\"]\n\n[Sidenote: BARGAINING FOR TERMS.]\n\n\"What is this business?\" said he.\n\n\"This is it,\" replied Ayrton. \"You desire to know from me certain\ncircumstances which may be useful to you. I desire to obtain from you\ncertain advantages which will be valuable to me. Now, I will make an\nexchange, my lord. Do you agree or not?\"\n\n\"What are these circumstances?\" asked Paganel, quickly.\n\n\"No,\" corrected Glenarvan: \"what are these advantages?\"\n\nAyrton bowed, showing that he understood the distinction.\n\n\"These,\" said he, \"are the advantages for which I petition. You\nstill intend, my lord, to deliver me into the hands of the English\nauthorities?\"\n\n\"Yes, Ayrton; it is only justice.\"\n\n\"I do not deny it,\" replied the quartermaster. \"You would not consent,\nthen, to set me at liberty?\"\n\nGlenarvan hesitated before answering a question so plainly asked.\nPerhaps the fate of Harry Grant depended upon what he was about to say.\nHowever, the feeling of duty towards humanity prevailed, and he said:\n\n\"No, Ayrton, I cannot set you at liberty.\"\n\n\"I do not ask it,\" replied the quartermaster, proudly.\n\n\"What do you wish, then?\"\n\n\"An intermediate fate, my lord, between that which you think awaits me\nand the liberty that you cannot grant me.\"\n\n\"And that is----?\"\n\n\"To abandon me on one of the desert islands of the Pacific, with the\nprincipal necessaries of life. I will manage as I can, and repent, if I\nhave time.\"\n\nGlenarvan, who was little prepared for this proposal, glanced at his\ntwo friends, who remained silent. After a few moments of reflection, he\nreplied:\n\n\"Ayrton, if I grant your request, will you tell me all that it is for\nmy interest to know?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord; that is to say, all that I know concerning Captain Grant\nand the Britannia.\"\n\n\"The whole truth?\"\n\n\"The whole.\"\n\n\"But who will warrant----?\"\n\n\"Oh, I see what troubles you, my lord. You do not like to trust to\nme,--to the word of a malefactor! That is right. But what can you do?\nThe situation is thus. You have only to accept or refuse.\"\n\n\"I will trust you, Ayrton,\" said Glenarvan, simply.\n\n\"And you will be right, my lord. Moreover, if I deceive you, you will\nalways have the power to revenge yourself.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"By recapturing me on this island, from which I shall not be able to\nescape.\"\n\nAyrton had a reply for everything. He met all difficulties, and\nproduced unanswerable arguments against himself. As was seen, he\nstrove to treat in his business with good faith. It was impossible for\na person to surrender with more perfect confidence, and yet he found\nmeans to advance still further in this disinterested course.\n\n\"My lord and gentlemen,\" added he, \"I desire that you should be\nconvinced that I am honorable. I do not seek to deceive you, but am\ngoing to give you a new proof of my sincerity in this affair. I act\nfrankly, because I rely upon your loyalty.\"\n\n\"Go on, Ayrton,\" replied Glenarvan.\n\n\"My lord, I have not yet your promise to agree to my proposition, and\nstill I do not hesitate to tell you that I know little concerning Harry\nGrant.\"\n\n\"Little!\" cried Glenarvan.\n\n\"Yes, my lord; the circumstances that I am able to communicate to\nyou are relative to myself. They are personal experiences, and will\nscarcely tend to put you on the track you have lost.\"\n\n[Sidenote: REVELATIONS AND DISCLOSURES.]\n\nA keen disappointment was manifest on the features of Glenarvan and\nthe major. They had believed the quartermaster to possess an important\nsecret, and y"}, {"chunk_id": 193, "text": "\"\ncried he.]\n\nAt last his voice rose above the tumult.\n\n\"Taboo! taboo!\" cried he.\n\nAt this word the crowd fell back before Glenarvan and his companions,\nthus temporarily preserved by a supernatural power. A few moments after\nthey were led back to the temple that served as their prison; but\nRobert Grant and Paganel were no longer with them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER L.\n\nTHE CHIEF'S FUNERAL.\n\n\nKai-Koumou, according to a custom quite ordinary in New Zealand, joined\nthe rank of priest to that of chief, and could, therefore, extend to\npersons or objects the superstitious protection of the taboo.\n\nThe taboo, which is common to the tribes of Polynesia, has the power\nto prohibit at once all connection with the object or person tabooed.\nAccording to the Maori religion, whoever should lay his sacrilegious\nhand on what is declared taboo would be punished with death by the\noffended god; and in case the divinity should delay to avenge his own\ninsult, the priests would not fail to excite his anger.\n\nAs for the prisoners confined in the temple, the taboo had rescued\nthem from the fury of the tribe. Some of the natives, the friends and\npartisans of Kai-Koumou, had stopped suddenly at the command of their\nchief, and had protected the captives.\n\n[Sidenote: THE TORTURES OF SUSPENSE.]\n\nGlenarvan, however, was not blind to the fate that was reserved for\nhim. Only his death could atone for the murder of a chief. Among savage\nraces death is always preceded by a protracted torture. He therefore\nexpected to cruelly expiate the righteous indignation that had nerved\nhis arm, but hoped that Kai-Koumou's rage would fall only on himself.\n\nWhat a night he and his companions passed! Who could depict their\nanguish, or measure their sufferings? Neither poor Robert nor brave\nPaganel had reappeared. But how could they doubt their fate? Were they\nnot the first victims of the natives' vengeance? All hope had vanished\neven from the heart of the major, who did not easily despair. John\nMangles felt himself growing mad at sight of the sad dejection of Mary\nGrant, thus separated from her brother. Glenarvan thought of that\nterrible request of Lady Helena, who, rather than yield to torture or\nslavery, preferred to die by his hand. Could he summon this fearful\ncourage? As for an escape, that was plainly impossible. Ten warriors,\narmed to the teeth, guarded the entrance of the temple.\n\nMorning came at last. There had been no communication between the\nnatives and the prisoners. The hut contained a considerable quantity\nof food, which the unfortunates scarcely touched. Hunger gave place to\ngrief. The day passed without bringing a change or a hope. Doubtless\nthe hour for the dead chief's funeral and their torture would be the\nsame.\n\nHowever, although Glenarvan concluded that Kai-Koumou must have\nabandoned all idea of exchange, the major on this point retained a\ngleam of hope.\n\n\"Who knows,\" said he, reminding Glenarvan of the effect produced upon\nthe chief by the death of Kara-Tété,--\"who knows but that Kai-Koumou in\nreality feels obliged to you?\"\n\nBut, in spite of these observations, Glenarvan would no longer hope.\nThe next day also passed away without the preparations for torture\nbeing made. The reason of the delay was this.\n\nThe Maoris believe that the soul, for three days after death, inhabits\nthe body of the deceased, and therefore during this time the corpse\nremains unburied. This custom was rigorously observed, and for two days\nthe pah was deserted. Captain Mangles frequently stood on Wilson's\nshoulders and surveyed the fortification. No native was seen; only the\nsentinels guarded in turn at the door of their prison.\n\nBut on the third day the huts were opened. The savages, men, women,\nand children, to the number of several hundreds, assembled in the pah,\nsilent and calm. Kai-Koumou came out of his house, and, surrounded by\nthe principal warriors of his tribe, took his place on a mound several\nfeet high in the centre of the fortification. The crowd of natives\nformed a semicircle aroun"}, {"chunk_id": 218, "text": "ave nothing to say, my lord. I was foolish enough to let myself be\ntaken. Do what you please.\"\n\n[Sidenote: A DUMB PRISONER.]\n\nHaving given his answer, the quartermaster turned his eyes toward\nthe coast that extended along the west, and affected a profound\nindifference for all that was passing around him. You would have\nthought, to look at him, that he was a stranger to this serious affair.\n\nBut Glenarvan had resolved to be patient. A powerful motive urged\nhim to ascertain certain circumstances of Ayrton's mysterious life,\nespecially as regarded Harry Grant and the Britannia. He therefore\nresumed his inquiries, speaking with extreme mildness, and imposing the\nmost perfect calmness upon the violent agitation of his heart.\n\n\"I hope, Ayrton,\" continued he, \"that you will not refuse to answer\ncertain questions that I desire to ask you. And, first, am I to call\nyou Ayrton or Ben Joyce? Are you the quartermaster of the Britannia?\"\n\nAyrton remained unmoved, watching the coast, deaf to every question.\nGlenarvan, whose eye flashed with some inward emotion, continued to\nquestion him.\n\n\"Will you tell me how you left the Britannia, and why you were in\nAustralia?\"\n\nThere was the same silence, the same obstinacy.\n\n\"Listen to me, Ayrton,\" resumed Glenarvan. \"It is for your interest to\nspeak. We may reward a frank confession, which is your only resort. For\nthe last time, will you answer my questions?\"\n\nAyrton turned his head towards Glenarvan, and looked him full in the\nface.\n\n\"My lord,\" said he, \"I have nothing to answer. It is for justice to\nprove against me.\"\n\n\"The proofs will be easy,\" replied Glenarvan.\n\n[Sidenote: USELESS APPEALS.]\n\n\"Easy, my lord?\" continued the quartermaster, in a sneering tone.\n\"Your lordship seems to me very hasty. I declare that the best judge\nin Westminster Hall would be puzzled to establish my identity. Who can\nsay why I came to Australia, since Captain Grant is no longer here to\ninform you? Who can prove that I am that Ben Joyce described by the\npolice, since they have never laid hands upon me, and my companions are\nat liberty? Who, except you, can charge me, not to say with a crime,\nbut even with a culpable action?\"\n\n[Illustration: Ayrton soon made his appearance. He crossed the deck\nwith a confident step, and ascended the poop-stairs.]\n\nAyrton had grown animated while speaking, but soon relapsed into his\nformer indifference. He doubtless imagined that this declaration would\nend the examination: but Glenarvan resumed, and said:\n\n\"Ayrton, I am not a judge charged with trying you. This is not my\nbusiness. It is important that our respective positions should be\nclearly defined. I ask nothing that can implicate you, for that is the\npart of justice. But you know what search I am pursuing, and, with a\nword, you can put me on the track I have lost. Will you speak?\"\n\nAyrton shook his head, like a man determined to keep silent.\n\n\"Will you tell me where Captain Grant is?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"No, my lord.\"\n\n\"Will you point out where the Britannia was wrecked?\"\n\n\"Certainly not.\"\n\n\"Ayrton,\" said Glenarvan, in almost a suppliant tone, \"will you, at\nleast, if you know where Captain Grant is, tell his poor children, who\nare only waiting for a word from your lips?\"\n\nThe quartermaster hesitated; his features quivered; but, in a low\nvoice, he muttered:\n\n\"I cannot, my lord.\"\n\nThen, as if he reproached himself for a moment's weakness, he added,\nangrily:\n\n\"No, I will not speak! Hang me if you will!\"\n\n\"Hang, then!\" cried Glenarvan, overcome by a sudden feeling of\nindignation.\n\nBut finally controlling himself, he said, in a grave voice:\n\n\"There are neither judges nor hangmen here. At the first landing-place\nyou shall be put into the hands of the English authorities.\"\n\n\"Just what I desire,\" replied the quartermaster.\n\nThereupon he was taken back to the cabin that served as his prison, and\ntwo sailors were stationed at the door, with orders to watch all his\nmovements. The witnesses of this scene retired indignant and in despair.\n\nSince Gl"}, {"chunk_id": 217, "text": "What do you mean, Tom?\" inquired Glenarvan.\n\n\"I mean,\" he replied, \"that when the quartermaster, Ayrton, learned,\nthe day after our departure, the Duncan's destination----\"\n\n\"Ayrton!\" cried Glenarvan. \"Is he on board?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord.\"\n\n\"Ayrton here!\" repeated Glenarvan, glancing at Captain Mangles.\n\n\"Wonderful indeed!\" said the young captain.\n\nIn an instant, with the swiftness of lightning, Ayrton's conduct, his\nlong-contrived treachery, Glenarvan's wound, the attack upon Mulready,\ntheir sufferings in the marshes of the Snowy, all the wretch's deeds,\nflashed upon the minds of the two men. And now, by a strange fatality,\nthe convict was in their power.\n\n\"Where is he?\" asked Glenarvan quickly.\n\n\"In a cabin in the forecastle,\" replied Tom Austin, \"closely guarded.\"\n\n\"Why this confinement?\"\n\n[Sidenote: AN UNOFFICIAL TRIBUNAL.]\n\n\"Because, when Ayrton saw that the yacht was sailing for New Zealand,\nhe flew into a passion; because he attempted to force me to change the\nship's course; because he threatened me; and, finally, because he urged\nmy men to a mutiny. I saw that he was a dangerous person, and was\ncompelled, therefore, to take precautions against him.\"\n\n\"And since that time?\"\n\n\"Since that time he has been in his cabin, without offering to come\nout.\"\n\n\"Good!\"\n\nAt this moment Glenarvan and Captain Mangles were summoned to the\nsaloon. Breakfast, which they so much needed, was ready. They took\nseats at the table, but did not speak of Ayrton.\n\nHowever, when the meal was ended, and the passengers had assembled on\ndeck, Glenarvan informed them of the quartermaster's presence on board.\nAt the same time he declared his intention of sending for him.\n\n\"Can I be released from attending this tribunal?\" asked Lady Helena.\n\"I confess to you, my dear Edward, that the sight of this unfortunate\nwould be very painful to me.\"\n\n\"It is only to confront him, Helena,\" replied Glenarvan. \"Remain,\nif you can. Ben Joyce should see himself face to face with all his\nintended victims.\"\n\nLady Helena yielded to this request, and Mary Grant and she took their\nplaces beside him, while around them stood the major, Paganel, Captain\nMangles, Robert, Wilson, Mulready, and Olbinett, all who had suffered\nso severely by the convict's treason. The crew of the yacht, who did\nnot yet understand the seriousness of these proceedings, maintained a\nprofound silence.\n\n\"Call Ayrton!\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVI.\n\nAYRTON'S OBSTINACY.\n\n\nAyrton soon made his appearance. He crossed the deck with a confident\nstep, and ascended the poop-stairs. His eyes had a sullen look, his\nteeth were set, and his fists clinched convulsively. His bearing\ndisplayed neither exultation nor humility. As soon as he was in Lord\nGlenarvan's presence, he folded his arms, and calmly and silently\nwaited to be questioned:\n\n\"Ayrton,\" said Glenarvan, \"here we all are, as you see, on board the\nDuncan, that you would have surrendered to Ben Joyce's accomplices.\"\n\nAt these words the lips of the quartermaster slightly trembled. A quick\nblush colored his hard features,--not the sign of remorse, but the\nshame of defeat. He was prisoner on this yacht that he had meant to\ncommand as master, and his fate was soon to be decided.\n\nHowever, he made no reply. Glenarvan waited patiently, but Ayrton still\npersisted in maintaining an obstinate silence.\n\n\"Speak, Ayrton; what have you to say?\" continued Glenarvan.\n\nThe convict hesitated, and the lines of his forehead were strongly\ncontracted. At last he said, in a calm voice:\n\n\"I have nothing to say, my lord. I was foolish enough to let myself be\ntaken. Do what you please.\"\n\n[Sidenote: A DUMB PRISONER.]\n\nHaving given his answer, the quartermaster turned his eyes toward\nthe coast that extended along the west, and affected a profound\nindifference for all that was passing around him.

And now, by a strange fatality,\nthe convict was in their power.\n\n\"Where is he?\" asked Glenarvan quickly.\n\n\"In a cabin in the forecastle,\" replied Tom Austin, \"closely guarded.\"\n\n\"Why this confinement?\"\n\n[Sidenote: AN UNOFFICIAL TRIBUNAL.]\n\n\"Because, when Ayrton saw that the yacht was sailing for New Zealand,\nhe flew into a passion; because he attempted to force me to change the\nship's course; because he threatened me; and, finally, because he urged\nmy men to a mutiny. I saw that he was a dangerous person, and was\ncompelled, therefore, to take precautions against him.\"\n\n\"And since that time?\"\n\n\"Since that time he has been in his cabin, without offering to come\nout.\"\n\n\"Good!\"\n\nAt this moment Glenarvan and Captain Mangles were summoned to the\nsaloon. Breakfast, which they so much needed, was ready. They took\nseats at the table, but did not speak of Ayrton.\n\nHowever, when the meal was ended, and the passengers had assembled on\ndeck, Glenarvan informed them of the quartermaster's presence on board.\nAt the same time he declared his intention of sending for him.\n\n\"Can I be released from attending this tribunal?\" asked Lady Helena.\n\"I confess to you, my dear Edward, that the sight of this unfortunate\nwould be very painful to me.\"\n\n\"It is only to confront him, Helena,\" replied Glenarvan. \"Remain,\nif you can. Ben Joyce should see himself face to face with all his\nintended victims.\"\n\nLady Helena yielded to this request, and Mary Grant and she took their\nplaces beside him, while around them stood the major, Paganel, Captain\nMangles, Robert, Wilson, Mulready, and Olbinett, all who had suffered\nso severely by the convict's treason. The crew of the yacht, who did\nnot yet understand the seriousness of these proceedings, maintained a\nprofound silence.\n\n\"Call Ayrton!\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVI.\n\nAYRTON'S OBSTINACY.\n\n\nAyrton soon made his appearance. He crossed the deck with a confident\nstep, and ascended the poop-stairs. His eyes had a sullen look, his\nteeth were set, and his fists clinched convulsively. His bearing\ndisplayed neither exultation nor humility. As soon as he was in Lord\nGlenarvan's presence, he folded his arms, and calmly and silently\nwaited to be questioned:\n\n\"Ayrton,\" said Glenarvan, \"here we all are, as you see, on board the\nDuncan, that you would have surrendered to Ben Joyce's accomplices.\"\n\nAt these words the lips of the quartermaster slightly trembled. A quick\nblush colored his hard features,--not the sign of remorse, but the\nshame of defeat. He was prisoner on this yacht that he had meant to\ncommand as master, and his fate was soon to be decided.\n\nHowever, he made no reply. Glenarvan waited patiently, but Ayrton still\npersisted in maintaining an obstinate silence.\n\n\"Speak, Ayrton; what have you to say?\" continued Glenarvan.\n\nThe convict hesitated, and the lines of his forehead were strongly\ncontracted. At last he said, in a calm voice:\n\n\"I have nothing to say, my lord. I was foolish enough to let myself be\ntaken. Do what you please.\"\n\n[Sidenote: A DUMB PRISONER.]\n\nHaving given his answer, the quartermaster turned his eyes toward\nthe coast that extended along the west, and affected a profound\nindifference for all that was passing around him.

You would have\nthought, to look at him, that he was a stranger to this serious affair.\n\nBut Glenarvan had resolved to be patient. A powerful motive urged\nhim to ascertain certain circumstances of Ayrton's mysterious life,\nespecially as regarded Harry Grant and the Britannia. He therefore\nresumed his inquiries, speaking with extreme mildness, and imposing the\nmost perfect calmness upon the violent agitation of his heart.\n\n\"I hope, Ayrton,\" continued he, \"that you will not refuse to answer\ncertain questions that I desire to ask you. And, first, am I to call\nyou Ayrton or Ben Joyce? Are you the quartermaster of the Britannia?\"\n\nAyrton remained unmoved, watching the coast, deaf to every question.\nGlenarvan, whose eye flashed with some inward emotion, continued to\nquestion him.\n\n\"Will you tell me how you left the Britannia, and why you were in\nAustralia?\"\n\nThere was the same silence, the same obstinacy.\n\n\"Listen to me, Ayrton,\" resumed Glenarvan. \"It is for your interest to\nspeak. We may reward a frank confession, which is your only resort. For\nthe last time, will you answer my questions?\"\n\nAyrton turned his head towards Glenarvan, and looked him full in the\nface.\n\n\"My lord,\" said he, \"I have nothing to answer. It is for justice to\nprove against me.\"\n\n\"The proofs will be easy,\" replied Glenarvan.\n\n[Sidenote: USELESS APPEALS.]\n\n\"Easy, my lord?\" continued the quartermaster, in a sneering tone.\n\"Your lordship seems to me very hasty. I declare that the best judge\nin Westminster Hall would be puzzled to establish my identity. Who can\nsay why I came to Australia, since Captain Grant is no longer here to\ninform you? Who can prove that I am that Ben Joyce described by the\npolice, since they have never laid hands upon me, and my companions are\nat liberty? Who, except you, can charge me, not to say with a crime,\nbut even with a culpable action?\"\n\n[Illustration: Ayrton soon made his appearance. He crossed the deck\nwith a confident step, and ascended the poop-stairs.]\n\nAyrton had grown animated while speaking, but soon relapsed into his\nformer indifference. He doubtless imagined that this declaration would\nend the examination: but Glenarvan resumed, and said:\n\n\"Ayrton, I am not a judge charged with trying you. This is not my\nbusiness. It is important that our respective positions should be\nclearly defined. I ask nothing that can implicate you, for that is the\npart of justice. But you know what search I am pursuing, and, with a\nword, you can put me on the track I have lost. Will you speak?\"\n\nAyrton shook his head, like a man determined to keep silent.\n\n\"Will you tell me where Captain Grant is?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"No, my lord.\"\n\n\"Will you point out where the Britannia was wrecked?\"\n\n\"Certainly not.\"\n\n\"Ayrton,\" said Glenarvan, in almost a suppliant tone, \"will you, at\nleast, if you know where Captain Grant is, tell his poor children, who\nare only waiting for a word from your lips?\"\n\nThe quartermaster hesitated; his features quivered; but, in a low\nvoice, he muttered:\n\n\"I cannot, my lord.\"\n\nThen, as if he reproached himself for a moment's weakness, he added,\nangrily:\n\n\"No, I will not speak! Hang me if you will!\"\n\n\"Hang, then!\" cried Glenarvan, overcome by a sudden feeling of\nindignation.\n\nBut finally controlling himself, he said, in a grave voice:\n\n\"There are neither judges nor hangmen here. At the first landing-place\nyou shall be put into the hands of the English authorities.\"\n\n\"Just what I desire,\" replied the quartermaster.\n\nThereupon he was taken back to the cabin that served as his prison, and\ntwo sailors were stationed at the door, with orders to watch all his\nmovements. The witnesses of this scene retired indignant and in despair.\n\nSince Gl"}, {"chunk_id": 113, "text": "hed\nthe hospitable dwelling of Mr. O'Moore, where his labor insured him a\ncomfortable livelihood.\n\n\"And if Ayrton is pleased with me,\" said the Irish colonist, when the\nstory was finished, \"I cannot but be pleased with him. He is an honest\nand intelligent man, a good worker, and, if he chooses, this house\nshall long be at his service.\"\n\nAyrton thanked Mr. O'Moore, and waited for further questions. He\nprobably thought, however, that the legitimate curiosity of his hearers\nought to be satisfied. What could he say that had not been repeated\na hundred times already? Glenarvan was, therefore, about to open the\nconversation on a new topic, to profit by the information received from\nAyrton, when the major, addressing him, said:\n\n\"You were quartermaster of the Britannia?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Ayrton.\n\nBut perceiving that a certain feeling of distrust, a doubt, however\nslight, had suggested this inquiry, he added,--\n\n\"I saved my contract from the wreck.\"\n\nHe immediately left the room in search of this authoritative document.\nDuring his absence, which lasted but a few moments, Mr. O'Moore said:\n\n\"My lord, I will answer for it that Ayrton is an honest man. During the\ntwo months that he has been in my employ, I have had no fault to find\nwith him. I knew the story of his shipwreck and captivity. He is a true\nman, and worthy of your entire confidence.\"\n\nGlenarvan was about to answer that he had never doubted Ayrton's\nhonesty, when the latter returned and presented his contract. It was a\npaper signed by the owners of the Britannia and Captain Grant, whose\nwriting Mary recognized immediately. It stated that \"Tom Ayrton, able\nseaman, was engaged as quartermaster on board the brig Britannia of\nGlasgow.\" There was, therefore, no possible doubt of Ayrton's identity,\nfor it would have been difficult to suppose that this contract could be\nin his hands and not belong to him.\n\n[Sidenote: ENTANGLEMENTS.]\n\n\"Now,\" said Glenarvan, \"I appeal to you all for advice as to what is\nbest to be done. Your advice, Ayrton, would be particularly valuable,\nand I should be much obliged if you would give it to us.\"\n\nThe sailor reflected a few moments, and then replied:\n\n\"I thank you, my lord, for the confidence you place in me, and hope to\nshow myself worthy of it. I have some knowledge of the country, and of\nthe customs of the natives; and, if I can be of use to you----\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" replied Glenarvan.\n\n\"I think, like you,\" continued Ayrton, \"that Captain Grant and his two\nsailors were saved from the shipwreck; but, since they have not reached\nthe English possessions, since they have not reappeared, I doubt not\nthat their fate was the same as my own, and that they are prisoners of\nthe natives.\"\n\n\"You repeat, Mr. Ayrton, the arguments that I have already\nsubstantiated,\" said Paganel. \"The shipwrecked seamen are evidently\nprisoners of the natives, as they feared. But ought we to suppose that,\nlike you, they have been carried to the north?\"\n\n\"It is quite likely, sir,\" replied Ayrton. \"The hostile tribes would\nhardly remain in the neighborhood of the English provinces.\"\n\n\"This fact will complicate our search,\" said Glenarvan, quite\ndisconcerted. \"How shall we find the traces of the prisoners in the\ninterior of so vast a continent?\"\n\nA prolonged silence followed this remark. Lady Helena frequently\ncast a questioning glance at her companions, but without eliciting a\nresponsive sign. Paganel himself was silent, contrary to his custom.\nHis usual ingenuity now failed him. Captain Mangles paced the room with\nlong strides, as if he had been on the deck of his vessel, involved in\nsome difficulty.\n\n\"And you, Mr. Ayrton,\" said Lady Helena, at length, to the\nquartermaster, \"what would you do?\"\n\n\"Madam,\" replied he, promptly, \"I should re-embark on board the Duncan,\nand go straight to the place of the shipwreck. There I should act\naccording to circumstances, or indications that chance might furnish.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" said Glenarvan; \"but we must wait till the Duncan is\nrepaired.\"\n\n\"Ah! you"}]}

He has stolen\nhis name and contract?\"\n\nAll eyes were turned towards MacNabb, who must have considered this\nmatter.\n\n\"These,\" replied he, in his calm voice, \"are the proofs that can be\nderived from this obscure state of affairs. In my opinion this man's\nreal name is Ayrton. Ben Joyce is his fighting title. It is certain\nthat he knows Harry Grant, and has been quartermaster on board the\nBritannia. These facts, proved already by the precise details given\nby Ayrton, are still further corroborated by the conversation of the\nconvicts that I have related. Let us not, therefore, be led astray\nby vain conjectures, but only be certain that Ayrton is Ben Joyce, a\nsailor of the Britannia, now chief of a band of convicts.\"\n\nThe major's explanation was accepted as conclusive.\n\n\"Now,\" replied Glenarvan, \"will you tell me how and why Harry Grant's\nquartermaster is in Australia?\"\n\n\"How, I do not know,\" said MacNabb; \"and the police declare they know\nno more than I on the subject. Why, it is also impossible for me to\nsay. Here is a mystery that the future will explain.\"\n\n\"The police do not even know the identity of Ayrton and Ben Joyce,\"\nsaid Captain Mangles.\n\n\"You are right, John,\" replied the major; \"and such information would\nbe likely to facilitate their search.\"\n\n\"This unfortunate, then,\" remarked Lady Helena, \"intruded into\nO'Moore's farm with a criminal intention?\"\n\n\"There is no doubt of it,\" continued MacNabb. \"He was meditating\nsome hostile attack upon the Irishman, when a better opportunity was\noffered. Chance threw us in his way. He heard Glenarvan's story of the\nshipwreck, and, like a bold man, he promptly decided to take part in\nthe expedition. At the Wimerra he communicated with one of his friends,\nthe farrier of Black Point, and thus left distinguishable traces of\nour course. His band followed us. A poisonous plant enabled him to\ngradually kill our oxen and horses. Then, at the proper moment, he\nentangled us in the marshes of the Snowy, and surrendered us to the\nconvicts he commanded.\"\n\nEverything possible had been said concerning Ben Joyce. His past had\njust been reviewed by the major, and the wretch appeared as he was,--a\nbold and formidable criminal. His intentions had been clearly proved,\nand required, on the part of Glenarvan, extreme vigilance. Fortunately,\nthere was less to fear from the detected bandit than the secret traitor.\n\nBut one serious fact appeared from this explanation. No one had yet\nthought of it; only Mary Grant, disregarding the past, looked forward\nto the future. Captain Mangles first saw her pale and disconsolate. He\nunderstood what was passing in her mind.\n\n\"Miss Mary!\" cried he, \"you are weeping!\"\n\n\"What is the matter, my child?\" asked Lady Helena.\n\n\"My father, madam, my father!\" replied the young girl.\n\nShe could not continue. But a sudden revelation dawned on the mind of\neach. They comprehended Mary's grief, why the tears flowed from her\neyes, why the "}, {"chunk_id": 71, "text": "lighted! Welcome, welcome! I am almost a Frenchman,\"\ncried the commander, shaking the geographer's arm with rather painful\nviolence.\n\n\"One of your friends?\" asked the major of Paganel.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied he, with national pride; \"we have friends in all parts\nof the world!\"\n\n[Illustration: \"Ah, I am delighted! Welcome, welcome! I am almost a\nFrenchman,\" cried the commander, shaking the geographer's arm with\nrather painful violence.]\n\n[Sidenote: RAISING A REGIMENT.]\n\nHe then entered into conversation with the commander. Glenarvan would\ngladly have put in a word in regard to his affairs, but the soldier\nwas telling his story, and was not in the mood to be interrupted.\nThis honest man had left France a long time before; and the native\nlanguage was no longer perfectly familiar to him: he had forgotten,\nif not words, at least the manner of combining them. As his visitors\nsoon learned, he had been a sergeant in the French army. Since the\nfoundation of the fort he had not left it, and commanded it by\nappointment from the Argentine government. He was by parentage a\nBasque, and his name was Manuel Ipharaguerre. A year after his arrival\nin the country, Sergeant Manuel was naturalized, joined the Argentine\narmy, and married an honest Indian woman, who had twins,--boys, to be\nsure, for the sergeant's worthy consort would never present him with\ndaughters. Manuel did not think of any other calling than that of the\nsoldier, and hoped, in time, with the help of God, to offer to the\nrepublic a whole battalion of young soldiers.\n\n\"You have seen them?\" said he. \"Charming fellows! Good soldiers! José!\nJuan! Miguel! Pepe! Pepe is only seven years old, and is already biting\nhis cartridge!\"\n\nPepe, hearing himself complimented, joined his two little feet, and\npresented arms with perfect precision.\n\n\"He will do!\" added the sergeant. \"He will be a major--or\nbrigadier-general one day!\"\n\nThis story lasted a quarter of an hour, to Thalcave's great\nastonishment. The Indian could not understand how so many words could\ncome from a single throat. No one interrupted the commander; and even\na French sergeant had to conclude at last, though not without forcing\nhis guests to accompany him to his dwelling. Here they were introduced\nto Madame Ipharaguerre, who appeared to be \"a good-looking person,\" if\nthis expression may be employed in regard to an Indian.\n\nWhen he had exhausted himself, the sergeant asked his guests to what he\nowed the honor of their visit. And now it was their turn to explain.\n\nPaganel, opening the conversation in French, told him of their journey\nacross the Pampas, and ended by asking why the Indians had abandoned\nthe country.\n\n\"War!\" replied the sergeant.\n\n\"War?\"\n\n\"Yes, civil war.\"\n\n\"Civil war?\" rejoined Paganel.\n\n\"Yes, war between Paraguay and Buenos Ayres,\" answered the sergeant.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Why, all the Indians of the north are in the rear of General Flores,\nand those of the plains are plundering.\"\n\n\"But the caziques?\"\n\n\"The caziques with them.\"\n\nThis answer was reported to Thalcave, who shook his head. Indeed,\nhe either did not know, or had forgotten, that a civil war, which\nwas afterwards to involve Brazil, was decimating two-thirds of the\nrepublic. The Indians had everything to gain in these internal\nstruggles, and could not neglect such fine opportunities for plunder.\nThe sergeant, therefore, was not mistaken in attributing this desertion\nof the Pampas to the civil war that was being waged in the northern\npart of the Argentine Provinces.\n\nBut this event disconcerted Glenarvan's hopes. If Captain Grant was\na prisoner of the caziques, he must have been carried by them to the\nnorthern frontiers. Yet how and where to find him? Must they attempt\na perilous and almost useless search to the northern limits of the\nPampas? It was a serious matter, which was to be earnestly considered.\n\nHowever, one important question was still to be asked of the sergeant,\nand the major thought of this, while his companions were looking at\neach other in silence.\n\n\"Hav"}, {"chunk_id": 188, "text": "event, such a\ntransaction; but still it was better to await the result. What,\nmoreover, could ten defenceless men do against thirty well-armed\nsavages? Besides, Glenarvan thought it likely that Kai-Koumou's tribe\nhad lost some chief of high rank whom they were particularly anxious to\nrecover; and he was not mistaken.\n\nThe next day the canoe ascended the river with increased swiftness.\nIt stopped for a moment at the junction of a small river which wound\nacross the plains on the right bank. Here another canoe, with ten\nnatives on board, joined Kai-Koumou. The warriors merely exchanged\nsalutations, and then continued their course. The new-comers had\nrecently fought against the English troops, as could be seen by their\ntattered garments, their gory weapons, and the wounds that still bled\nbeneath their rags. They were gloomy and taciturn, and, with the\nindifference common to all savage races, paid no attention to the\ncaptives.\n\nTowards evening Kai-Koumou landed at the foot of the mountains,\nwhose nearer ridges reached precipitously to the river-bank. Here\ntwenty natives, who had disembarked from their canoes, were making\npreparations for the night. Fires blazed beneath the trees. A chief,\nequal in rank to Kai-Koumou, advanced with measured pace, and, rubbing\nhis nose against that of the latter, saluted him cordially. The\nprisoners were stationed in the centre of the encampment, and guarded\nwith extreme vigilance.\n\nThe next morning the ascent of the Waikato was resumed. Other boats\ncame from various affluents of the river. Sixty warriors, evidently\nfugitives from the last insurrection, had now assembled, and were\nreturning, more or less wounded in the fray, to the mountain districts.\nSometimes a song arose from the canoes, as they advanced in single\nfile. One native struck up the patriotic ode of the mysterious \"Pihé,\"\nthe national hymn that calls the Maoris to battle. The full and\nsonorous voice of the singer waked the echoes of the mountains; and\nafter each stanza his comrades struck their breasts, and sang the\nwarlike verses in chorus. Then they seized their oars again, and the\ncanoes were headed up stream.\n\nDuring the day a singular sight enlivened the voyage. About four\no'clock the canoe, without lessening its speed, guided by the steady\nhand of the chief, dashed through a narrow gorge. Eddies broke\nviolently against numerous small islands, which rendered navigation\nexceeding dangerous. Never could it be more hazardous to capsize, for\nthe banks afforded no refuge, and whoever had set foot on the porous\ncrust of the shore would probably have perished. At this point the\nriver flowed between warm springs, oxide of iron colored the muddy\nground a brilliant red, and not a yard of firm earth could be seen.\nThe air was heavy with a penetrating sulphureous odor. The natives did\nnot regard it, but the captives were seriously annoyed by the noxious\nvapors exhaled from the fissures of the soil and the bubbles that\nburst and discharged their gaseous contents. Yet, however disagreeable\nthese emanations were, the eye could not but admire this magnificent\nspectacle.\n\n[Illustration: At this point the river flowed between warm springs, and\nnot a yard of firm earth could be seen.]\n\nThe canoes soon after entered a dense cloud of white smoke, whose\nwreaths rose in gradually decreasing circles above the river. On the\nshores a hundred geysers, some shooting forth masses of vapor, and\nothers overflowing in liquid columns, varied their effects, like the\njets and cascades of a fountain. It seemed as though some engineer was\ndirecting at his pleasure the outflowings of these springs, as the\nwaters and vapor, mingling in the air, formed rainbows in the sunbeams.\n\nFor two miles the canoes glided within this vapory atmosphere,\nenveloped in its warm waves that rolled along the surface of the water.\nThen the sulphureous smoke disappeared, and a pure swift current of\nfresh air refreshed the panting voyagers. The region of the springs was\npassed. Before the cl"}, {"chunk_id": 172, "text": "captain seized the sailor's hand.\n\n\"The surf!\" said he.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Wilson. \"The sea is breaking on the reefs.\"\n\n\"Not more than two cable-lengths distant.\"\n\n\"Not more! The shore is here!\"\n\nCaptain Mangles leaned over the railing, gazed at the dark waves, and\ncried:\n\n\"The sounding-lead, Wilson!\"\n\nThe skipper, who was in the forecastle, did not seem to suspect his\nsituation. Wilson grasped the sounding-line, which lay coiled in its\npail, and rushed into the port-shrouds. He cast the lead; the rope\nslipped between his fingers; at the third knot it stopped.\n\n\"Three fathoms!\" cried Wilson.\n\n\"We are on the breakers!\" shouted the sober captain to the stupefied\none.\n\nWhether the former saw Halley shrug his shoulders or not is of little\nconsequence. At all events, he rushed towards the wheel and crowded\nthe helm hard alee, while Wilson, letting go the line, hauled upon the\ntop-sail yard-arms to luff the ship. The sailor who was steering, and\nhad been forcibly pushed aside, did not at all understand this sudden\nattack.\n\n\"To the port-yards! let loose the sails!\" cried the young captain,\nmanaging so as to escape the reefs.\n\nFor half a minute, the starboard side of the brig grazed the rocks,\nand, in spite of the darkness, John perceived a roaring line of\nbreakers that foamed a few yards from the ship.\n\n[Sidenote: VERY CRITICAL CIRCUMSTANCES.]\n\nAt this moment Will Halley, becoming conscious of the imminent danger,\nlost his presence of mind. His sailors, who were scarcely sober,\ncould not comprehend his orders. Moreover, his incoherent words and\ncontradictory commands showed that this stupid drunkard's coolness\nhad failed. He was surprised by the nearness of the land, which was\nonly eight miles off, when he thought it thirty or forty. The currents\nhad taken him unawares, and thrown him out of his ordinary course.\n\n[Illustration: The sailor who was steering, and had been forcibly\npushed aside, did not at all understand this sudden attack.]\n\nHowever, Captain Mangles's prompt management had rescued the brig from\nher peril; but he did not know his position. Perhaps he was inclosed by\na chain of reefs. The wind blew fresh from the east, and at every pitch\nthey might strike bottom.\n\nThe roar of the surf was soon redoubled, and it was necessary to luff\nstill more. John crowded the helm down and braced farther to leeward.\nThe breakers multiplied beneath the prow of the ship, and they were\nobliged to tack so as to put to sea. Would this manoeuvre succeed with\nsuch an unsteady vessel, and under such reduced sail? It was uncertain,\nbut as their only chance they must venture it.\n\n\"Hard alee!\" cried Captain Mangles to Wilson.\n\nThe Macquarie began to approach the new line of reefs. Soon the\nwater foamed above the submerged rocks. It was a moment of torturing\nsuspense. The spray glittered on the crests of the waves. You would\nhave thought a phosphorescent glow had suddenly illumined the water.\nWilson and Mulready forced down the wheel with their whole weight.\n\nSuddenly a shock was felt. The vessel had struck upon a rock. The\nbob-stays broke, and nearly overthrew the mainmast. Could they come\nabout without any other injury? No; for all at once there was a calm,\nand the ship veered to windward again, and her movements suddenly\nceased. A lofty wave seized and bore her forward towards the reefs,\nwhile she rolled heavily. The mainmast went by the board with all its\nrigging, the brig heaved twice and was motionless, leaning over to\nstarboard. The pump-lights were shattered in pieces, and the passengers\nrushed to the deck; but the waves were sweeping it from one end to\nthe other, and they could not remain without danger. Captain Mangles,\nknowing that the ship was firmly imbedded in the sand, besought them\nfor their own sakes to go below again.\n\n\"The truth, John?\" asked Glenarvan, faintly.\n\n\"The truth, my lord, is that we shall not founder. As for being\ndestroyed by the sea, that is another question; but we have time to\ntake counsel.\"\n\n\"Is it midnight?\"\n\n\"Yes,"}, {"chunk_id": 158, "text": "of a mile distant.

Captain Mangles and the major\nrushed towards it. In a few moments they perceived, on the edge of\nthe coppice, a human form that was dragging itself along and groaning\npiteously. It was Mulready, wounded and half dead. When his companions\nraised him, they felt their hands dabbling in blood. The rain now\nincreased, and the wind howled through the branches of the dead trees.\nIn the midst of these terrific gusts, Glenarvan, the major, and the\ncaptain bore the body of Mulready.\n\nOn arriving at the cart, Paganel, Robert, Wilson, and Olbinett came\nout, and Lady Helena gave up her room to the poor sailor. The major\ntook off Mulready's vest, wet with blood and rain. He discovered the\nwound. It was a poniard stab, which the unfortunate had received in his\nright side.\n\nMacNabb dressed it skillfully. Whether the weapon had reached the vital\nparts, he could not say. A stream of bright-red blood spurted forth,\nwhile the paleness and the swoon of the wounded man proved that he had\nbeen seriously injured. The major accordingly placed upon the opening\nof the wound, after first washing it with fresh water, a thick wad of\ntinder, and then a few layers of lint, confined by a bandage, and thus\nsucceeded in stopping the hemorrhage. The patient was then laid on his\nside, his head and breast raised, and Lady Helena gave him a refreshing\ndraught.\n\nAt the end of a quarter of an hour, the wounded man, who had been\nmotionless till then, made a movement. His eyes half opened, his lips\nmurmured disconnected words, and the major, putting down his ear, heard\nhim say:\n\n\"My lord--the letter--Ben Joyce----\"\n\n[Sidenote: A DAY OF DOUBT.]\n\nThe major repeated these words, and glanced at his companions. What did\nMulready mean? Ben Joyce had attacked the sailor, but why? Was it not\nsimply for the purpose of preventing him from reaching the Duncan? This\nletter--Glenarvan examined the sailor's pockets. The letter addressed\nto Tom Austin was gone.\n\nThe night passed in anxiety and anguish. They feared every moment that\nthe wounded man would die. A burning fever consumed him. Lady Helena\nand Mary Grant, as though his sisters, did not leave him; never was\npatient better nursed, or by more tender hands.\n\nDay appeared. The rain had ceased. Heavy clouds still rolled along\nthe vault of the sky, and the earth was strewn with the fragments of\nbranches. The clay, soaked by floods of water, had yielded; and the\nsides of the cart became unsteady, but sank no deeper.\n\nCaptain Mangles, Paganel, and Glenarvan took a tour of exploration\naround the camp. They traversed the path still marked with blood, but\nfound no trace of Ben Joyce or his band. They went to the place where\nthe attack had been made. Here two corpses lay on the ground, shot\nby Mulready. One was the farrier of Black Point. His face, which had\nmortified, was a horrible sight.\n\nGlenarvan did not pursue his investigations farther, prudence\nforbidding. He therefore returned to the cart, much alarmed by the\nseriousness of the situation.\n\n\"We cannot think of sending another messenger to Melbourne,\" said he.\n\n\"But we must,\" replied Captain Mangles; \"and I will make the attempt,\nsince my sailor has failed.\"\n\n\"No, John. You have not even a horse to carry you these two hundred\nmiles.\"\n\nIndeed, Mulready's horse, the only one that remained, had not\nreappeared. Had he fallen beneath the shots of the murderers? Was he\nrunning wild over the desert? Had the convicts captured him?\n\n[Illustration: In the midst of these terrific gusts, Glenarvan, the\nmajor, and the captain bore the body of Mulready.]\n\n[Sidenote: RESOLUTION, AND RECOVERY.]\n\n\"Whatever happens,\" continued Glenarvan, \"we will separate no more.\nLet us wait eight or fifteen days, till the waters of the river resume\ntheir natural level.

Memory\nmakes the one, philosophy the other.”\n\n“But cannot one learn philosophy?”\n\n“Philosophy cannot be taught; it is the application of the sciences to\ntruth; it is like the golden cloud in which the Messiah went up into\nheaven.”\n\n“Well, then,” said Dantès, “What shall you teach me first? I am in a\nhurry to begin. I want to learn.”\n\n“Everything,” said the abbé. And that very evening the prisoners\nsketched a plan of education, to be entered upon the following day.\nDantès possessed a prodigious memory, combined with an astonishing\nquickness and readiness of conception; the mathematical turn of his\nmind rendered him apt at all kinds of calculation, while his naturally\npoetical feelings threw a light and pleasing veil over the dry reality\nof arithmetical computation, or the rigid severity of geometry. He\nalready knew Italian, and had also picked up a little of the Romaic\ndialect during voyages to the East; and by the aid of these two\nlanguages he easily comprehended the construction of all the others, so\nthat at the end of six months he began to speak Spanish, English, and\nGerman.\n\nIn strict accordance with the promise made to the abbé, Dantès spoke no\nmore of escape. Perhaps the delight his studies afforded him left no\nroom for such thoughts; perhaps the recollection that he had pledged\nhis word (on which his sense of honor was keen) kept him from referring\nin any way to the possibilities of flight. Days, even months, passed by\nunheeded in one rapid and instructive course. At the end of a year\nDantès was a new man. Dantès observed, however, that Faria, in spite of\nthe relief his society afforded, daily grew sadder; one thought seemed\nincessantly to harass and distract his mind. Sometimes he would fall\ninto long reveries, sigh heavily and involuntarily, then suddenly rise,\nand, with folded arms, begin pacing the confined space of his dungeon.\nOne day he stopped all at once, and exclaimed:\n\n“Ah, if there were no sentinel!”\n\n“There shall not be one a minute longer than you please,” said Dantès,\nwho had followed the working of his thoughts as accurately as though\nhis brain were enclosed in crystal so clear as to display its minutest\noperations.\n\n“I have already told you,” answered the abbé, “that I loathe the idea\nof shedding blood.”\n\n“And yet the murder, if you choose to call it so, would be simply a\nmeasure of self-preservation.”\n\n“No matter! I could never agree to it.”\n\n“Still, you have thought of it?”\n\n“Incessantly, alas!” cried the abbé.\n\n“And you have discovered a means of regaining our freedom, have you\nnot?” asked Dantès eagerly.\n\n“I have; if it were only possible to place a deaf and blind sentinel in\nthe gallery beyond us.”\n\n“He shall be both blind and deaf,” replied the young man, with an air\nof determination that made his companion shudder.\n\n“No, no,” cried the abbé; “impossible!”\n\nDantès endeavored to renew the subject; the abbé shook his head in\ntoken of disapproval, and refused to make any further response. Three\nmonths passed away.\n\n“Are you strong?” the abbé asked one day of Dantès. The young man, in\nreply, took up the chisel, bent it into the form of a horseshoe, and\nthen as readily straightened it.\n\n“And will you engage not to do any harm to the sentry, except as a last\nresort?”\n\n“I promise on my honor.”\n\n“Then,” said the abbé, “we may hope to put our design into execution.”\n\n“And how long shall we be in accomplishing the necessary work?”\n\n“At least a year.”\n\n“And shall we begin at once?”\n\n“At once.”\n\n“We have lost a year to no purpose!” cried Dantès.\n\n“Do you consider the last twelve months to have been wasted?” asked the\nabbé.\n\n“Forgive me!” cried Edmond, blushing deeply.\n\n“Tut, tut!” answered the abbé, “man is but man after all, and you are\nabout the best specimen of the genus I have ever known. Come, let me\nsh"}, {"chunk_id": 200, "text": "ce made that answer,\nthe safety of Rome was concerned; but, as for us, it is only to gratify\na whim, and it would be ridiculous to risk our lives for so foolish a\nmotive.”\n\nAlbert poured himself out a glass of _lacryma Christi_, which he sipped\nat intervals, muttering some unintelligible words.\n\n“Well, Signor Pastrini,” said Franz, “now that my companion is quieted,\nand you have seen how peaceful my intentions are, tell me who is this\nLuigi Vampa. Is he a shepherd or a nobleman?—young or old?—tall or\nshort? Describe him, in order that, if we meet him by chance, like Jean\nSbogar or Lara, we may recognize him.”\n\n“You could not apply to anyone better able to inform you on all these\npoints, for I knew him when he was a child, and one day that I fell\ninto his hands, going from Ferentino to Alatri, he, fortunately for me,\nrecollected me, and set me free, not only without ransom, but made me a\npresent of a very splendid watch, and related his history to me.”\n\n“Let us see the watch,” said Albert.\n\nSignor Pastrini drew from his fob a magnificent Bréguet, bearing the\nname of its maker, of Parisian manufacture, and a count’s coronet.\n\n“Here it is,” said he.\n\n“_Peste!_” returned Albert, “I compliment you on it; I have its\nfellow”—he took his watch from his waistcoat pocket—“and it cost me\n3,000 francs.”\n\n“Let us hear the history,” said Franz, motioning Signor Pastrini to\nseat himself.\n\n“Your excellencies permit it?” asked the host.\n\n“_Pardieu!_” cried Albert, “you are not a preacher, to remain\nstanding!”\n\nThe host sat down, after having made each of them a respectful bow,\nwhich meant that he was ready to tell them all they wished to know\nconcerning Luigi Vampa.\n\n“You tell me,” said Franz, at the moment Signor Pastrini was about to\nopen his mouth, “that you knew Luigi Vampa when he was a child—he is\nstill a young man, then?”\n\n“A young man? he is only two-and-twenty;—he will gain himself a\nreputation.”\n\n“What do you think of that, Albert?—at two-and-twenty to be thus\nfamous?”\n\n“Yes, and at his age, Alexander, Cæsar, and Napoleon, who have all made\nsome noise in the world, were quite behind him.”\n\n“So,” continued Franz, “the hero of this history is only\ntwo-and-twenty?”\n\n“Scarcely so much.”\n\n“Is he tall or short?”\n\n“Of the middle height—about the same stature as his excellency,”\nreturned the host, pointing to Albert.\n\n“Thanks for the comparison,” said Albert, with a bow.\n\n“Go on, Signor Pastrini,” continued Franz, smiling at his friend’s\nsusceptibility. “To what class of society does he belong?”\n\n“He was a shepherd-boy attached to the farm of the Count of San-Felice,\nsituated between Palestrina and the Lake of Gabri; he was born at\nPampinara, and entered the count’s service when he was five years old;\nhis father was also a shepherd, who owned a small flock, and lived by\nthe wool and the milk, which he sold at Rome. When quite a child, the\nlittle Vampa displayed a most extraordinary precocity. One day, when he\nwas seven years old, he came to the curate of Palestrina, and asked to\nbe taught to read; it was somewhat difficult, for he could not quit his\nflock; but the good curate went every day to say mass at a little\nhamlet too poor to pay a priest and which, having no other name, was\ncalled Borgo; he told Luigi that he might meet him on his return, and\nthat then he would give him a lesson, warning him that it would be\nshort, and that he must profit as much as possible by it. The child\naccepted joyfully. Every day Luigi led his flock to graze on the road\nthat leads from Palestrina to Borgo; every day, at nine o’clock in the\nmorning, the priest and the boy sat down on a bank by the wayside, and\nthe little shepherd took his lesson out of the priest’s breviary. At\nthe end of three months he had learned to read. This was not enough—he\nmust now learn to write.

At\nthe end of three months he had learned to read. This was not enough—he\nmust now learn to write. The priest had a writing teacher at Rome make\nthree alphabets—one large, one middling, and one small; and pointed out\nto him that by the help of a sharp instrument he could trace the\nletters on a slate, and thus learn to write. The same evening, when the\nflock was safe at the farm, the little Luigi hastened to the smith at\nPalestrina, took a large nail, heated and sharpened it, and formed a\nsort of stylus. The next morning he gathered an armful of pieces of\nslate and began. At the end of three months he had learned to write.\nThe curate, astonished at his quickness and intelligence, made him a\npresent of pens, paper, and a penknife. This demanded new effort, but\nnothing compared to the first; at the end of a week he wrote as well\nwith this pen as with the stylus. The curate related the incident to\nthe Count of San-Felice, who sent for the little shepherd, made him\nread and write before him, ordered his attendant to let him eat with\nthe domestics, and to give him two piastres a month. With this, Luigi\npurchased books and pencils. He applied his imitative powers to\neverything, and, like Giotto, when young, he drew on his slate sheep,\nhouses, and trees. Then, with his knife, he began to carve all sorts of\nobjects in wood; it was thus that Pinelli, the famous sculptor, had\ncommenced.\n\n20105m\n\n\n\n“A girl of six or seven—that is, a little younger than Vampa—tended\nsheep on a farm near Palestrina; she was an orphan, born at Valmontone\nand was named Teresa. The two children met, sat down near each other,\nlet their flocks mingle together, played, laughed, and conversed\ntogether; in the evening they separated the Count of San-Felice’s flock\nfrom those of Baron Cervetri, and the children returned to their\nrespective farms, promising to meet the next morning. The next day they\nkept their word, and thus they grew up together. Vampa was twelve, and\nTeresa eleven. And yet their natural disposition revealed itself.\nBeside his taste for the fine arts, which Luigi had carried as far as\nhe could in his solitude, he was given to alternating fits of sadness\nand enthusiasm, was often angry and capricious, and always sarcastic.\nNone of the lads of Pampinara, Palestrina, or Valmontone had been able\nto gain any influence over him or even to become his companion. His\ndisposition (always inclined to exact concessions rather than to make\nthem) kept him aloof from all friendships. Teresa alone ruled by a\nlook, a word, a gesture, this impetuous character, which yielded\nbeneath the hand of a woman, and which beneath the hand of a man might\nhave broken, but could never have been bended. Teresa was lively and\ngay, but coquettish to excess. The two piastres that Luigi received\nevery month from the Count of San-Felice’s steward, and the price of\nall the little carvings in wood he sold at Rome, were expended in\near-rings, necklaces, and gold hairpins. So that, thanks to her\nfriend’s generosity, Teresa was the most beautiful and the best-attired\npeasant near Rome.\n\n“The two children grew up together, passing all their time with each\nother, and giving themselves up to the wild ideas of their different\ncharacters. Thus, in all their dreams, their wishes, and their\nconversations, Vampa saw himself the captain of a vessel, general of an\narmy, or governor of a province. Teresa saw herself rich, superbly\nattired, and attended by a train of liveried domestics. Then, when they\nhad thus passed the day in building castles in the air, they separated\ntheir flocks, and descended from the elevation of their dreams to the\nreality of their humble position.\n\n“One day the young shepherd told the count’s steward that he had seen a\nwolf come out of the Sabine mountains, and prowl ar"}, {"chunk_id": 473, "text": "\ntalent are they celebrated? You know there are different sorts.”\n\n“That tall, harsh-looking man is very learned, he discovered, in the\nneighborhood of Rome, a kind of lizard with a vertebra more than\nlizards usually have, and he immediately laid his discovery before the\nInstitute. The thing was discussed for a long time, but finally decided\nin his favor. I can assure you the vertebra made a great noise in the\nlearned world, and the gentleman, who was only a knight of the Legion\nof Honor, was made an officer.”\n\n“Come,” said Monte Cristo, “this cross seems to me to be wisely\nawarded. I suppose, had he found another additional vertebra, they\nwould have made him a commander.”\n\n“Very likely,” said Albert.\n\n“And who can that person be who has taken it into his head to wrap\nhimself up in a blue coat embroidered with green?”\n\n“Oh, that coat is not his own idea; it is the Republic’s, which deputed\nDavid12 to devise a uniform for the Academicians.”\n\n“Indeed?” said Monte Cristo; “so this gentleman is an Academician?”\n\n“Within the last week he has been made one of the learned assembly.”\n\n“And what is his especial talent?”\n\n“His talent? I believe he thrusts pins through the heads of rabbits, he\nmakes fowls eat madder, and punches the spinal marrow out of dogs with\nwhalebone.”\n\n“And he is made a member of the Academy of Sciences for this?”\n\n“No; of the French Academy.”\n\n“But what has the French Academy to do with all this?”\n\n“I was going to tell you. It seems——”\n\n“That his experiments have very considerably advanced the cause of\nscience, doubtless?”\n\n“No; that his style of writing is very good.”\n\n“This must be very flattering to the feelings of the rabbits into whose\nheads he has thrust pins, to the fowls whose bones he has dyed red, and\nto the dogs whose spinal marrow he has punched out?”\n\nAlbert laughed.\n\n“And the other one?” demanded the count.\n\n“That one?”\n\n“Yes, the third.”\n\n“The one in the dark blue coat?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“He is a colleague of the count, and one of the most active opponents\nto the idea of providing the Chamber of Peers with a uniform. He was\nvery successful upon that question. He stood badly with the Liberal\npapers, but his noble opposition to the wishes of the court is now\ngetting him into favor with the journalists. They talk of making him an\nambassador.”\n\n30303m\n\n\n\n“And what are his claims to the peerage?”\n\n“He has composed two or three comic operas, written four or five\narticles in the _Siècle_, and voted five or six years on the\nministerial side.”\n\n“Bravo, viscount,” said Monte Cristo, smiling; “you are a delightful\n_cicerone_. And now you will do me a favor, will you not?”\n\n“What is it?”\n\n“Do not introduce me to any of these gentlemen; and should they wish\nit, you will warn me.” Just then the count felt his arm pressed. He\nturned round; it was Danglars.\n\n“Ah! is it you, baron?” said he.\n\n“Why do you call me baron?” said Danglars; “you know that I care\nnothing for my title. I am not like you, viscount; you like your title,\ndo you not?”\n\n“Certainly,” replied Albert, “seeing that without my title I should be\nnothing; while you, sacrificing the baron, would still remain the\nmillionaire.”\n\n“Which seems to me the finest title under the royalty of July,” replied\nDanglars.\n\n“Unfortunately,” said Monte Cristo, “one’s title to a millionaire does\nnot last for life, like that of baron, peer of France, or academician;\nfor example, the millionaires Franck & Poulmann, of Frankfurt, who have\njust become bankrupts.”\n\n“Indeed?” said Danglars, becoming pale.\n\n“Yes; I received the news this evening by a courier. I had about a\nmillion in their hands, but, warned in time, I withdrew it a month\nago.”\n\n“Ah, _mon Dieu!_” exclaimed Danglars, “they have drawn on me for\n200,000 francs!”\n\n“Well, you can throw out the draft; their signature is worth five per\ncent.”\n\n“Yes, but it is too late,” said Danglars, “I have honored their bills.”\n\n“Then,” said Monte Cristo, “here are 200,000 francs gone after——”\n\n“Hush, do not mention these things,” said Da"}, {"chunk_id": 86, "text": "en weary with\ntoil, you had your hopes to refresh and encourage you.”\n\n“I assure you,” replied the old man, “I did not turn to that source for\nrecreation or support.”\n\n“What did you do then?”\n\n“I wrote or studied.”\n\n“Were you then permitted the use of pens, ink, and paper?”\n\n“Oh, no,” answered the abbé; “I had none but what I made for myself.”\n\n“You made paper, pens and ink?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nDantès gazed with admiration, but he had some difficulty in believing.\nFaria saw this.\n\n“When you pay me a visit in my cell, my young friend,” said he, “I will\nshow you an entire work, the fruits of the thoughts and reflections of\nmy whole life; many of them meditated over in the shades of the\nColosseum at Rome, at the foot of St. Mark’s column at Venice, and on\nthe borders of the Arno at Florence, little imagining at the time that\nthey would be arranged in order within the walls of the Château d’If.\nThe work I speak of is called _A Treatise on the Possibility of a\nGeneral Monarchy in Italy_, and will make one large quarto volume.”\n\n“And on what have you written all this?”\n\n“On two of my shirts.

To the committee the adventure was so extraordinary and\ncurious, that the interest they had felt for the count’s safety became\nnow quite a secondary matter.

It had been supposed some of the papers might\nbe in the Arabian, Romaic, or Turkish language, and the interpreter of\nthe House was in attendance.

So life went on for\nthem as it does for those who are not victims of misfortune and whose\nactivities glide along mechanically and tranquilly beneath the eye of\nProvidence.\n\nBut beneath this superficial calm there were in the heart of the young\nman, and perhaps in that of the old man, many repressed desires, many\nstifled sighs, which found vent when Faria was left alone, and when\nEdmond returned to his cell.\n\nOne night Edmond awoke suddenly, believing that he heard someone\ncalling him. He opened his eyes upon utter darkness. His name, or\nrather a plaintive voice which essayed to pronounce his name, reached\nhim. He sat up in bed and a cold sweat broke out upon his brow.\nUndoubtedly the call came from Faria’s dungeon.\n\n“Alas,” murmured Edmond; “can it be?”\n\nHe moved his bed, drew up the stone, rushed into the passage, and\nreached the opposite extremity; the secret entrance was open. By the\nlight of the wretched and wavering lamp, of which we have spoken,\nDantès saw the old man, pale, but yet erect, clinging to the bedstead.\nHis features were writhing with those horrible symptoms which he\nalready knew, and which had so seriously alarmed him when he saw them\nfor the first time.\n\n“Alas, my dear friend,” said Faria in a resigned tone, “you understand,\ndo you not, and I need not attempt to explain to you?”\n\nEdmond uttered a cry of agony, and, quite out of his senses, rushed\ntowards the door, exclaiming, “Help, help!”\n\nFaria had just sufficient strength to restrain him.\n\n“Silence,” he said, “or you are lost. We must now only think of you, my\ndear friend, and so act as to render your captivity supportable or your\nflight possible. It would require years to do again what I have done\nhere, and the results would be instantly destroyed if our jailers knew\nwe had communicated with each other. Besides, be assured, my dear\nEdmond, the dungeon I am about to leave will not long remain empty;\nsome other unfortunate being will soon take my place, and to him you\nwill appear like an angel of salvation. Perhaps he will be young,\nstrong, and enduring, like yourself, and will aid you in your escape,\nwhile I have been but a hindrance. You will no longer have half a dead\nbody tied to you as a drag to all your movements. At length Providence\nhas done something for you; he restores to you more than he takes away,\nand it was time I should die.”\n\nEdmond could only clasp his hands and exclaim, “Oh, my friend, my\nfriend, speak not thus!” and then resuming all his presence of mind,\nwhich had for a moment staggered under this blow, and his strength,\nwhich had failed at the words of the old man, he said, “Oh, I have\nsaved you once, and I will save you a second time!” And raising the\nfoot of the bed, he drew out the phial, still a third filled with the\nred liquor.\n\n“See,” he exclaimed, “there remains still some of the magic draught.\nQuick, quick! tell me what I must do this time; are there any fresh\ninstructions? Speak, my friend; I listen.”\n\n“There is not a hope,” replied Faria, shaking his head, “but no matter;\nGod wills it that man whom he has created, and in whose heart he has so\nprofoundly rooted the love of life, should do all in his power to\npreserve that existence, which, however painful it may be, is yet\nalways so dear.”\n\n“Oh, yes, yes!” exclaimed Dantès; “and I tell you that I will save you\nyet.”\n\n“Well, then, try.

How a Gardener May Get Rid of the Dormice that Eat His\n Peaches\n\nNot on the same night as he had stated, but the next morning, the Count\nof Monte Cristo went out by the Barrière d’Enfer, taking the road to\nOrléans. Leaving the village of Linas, without stopping at the\ntelegraph, which flourished its great bony arms as he passed, the count\nreached the tower of Montlhéry, situated, as everyone knows, upon the\nhighest point of the plain of that name. At the foot of the hill the\ncount dismounted and began to ascend by a little winding path, about\neighteen inches wide; when he reached the summit he found himself\nstopped by a hedge, upon which green fruit had succeeded to red and\nwhite flowers.\n\nMonte Cristo looked for the entrance to the enclosure, and was not long\nin finding a little wooden gate, working on willow hinges, and fastened\nwith a nail and string. The count soon mastered the mechanism, the gate\nopened, and he then found himself in a little garden, about twenty feet\nlong by twelve wide, bounded on one side by part of the hedge, which\ncontained the ingenious contrivance we have called a gate, and on the\nother by the old tower, covered with ivy and studded with wall-flowers.\n\nNo one would have thought in looking at this old, weather-beaten,\nfloral-decked tower (which might be likened to an elderly dame dressed\nup to receive her grandchildren at a birthday feast) that it would have\nbeen capable of telling strange things, if,—in addition to the menacing\nears which the proverb says all walls are provided with,—it had also a\nvoice.\n\nThe garden was crossed by a path of red gravel, edged by a border of\nthick box, of many years’ growth, and of a tone and color that would\nhave delighted the heart of Delacroix, our modern Rubens. This path was\nformed in the shape of the figure of 8, thus, in its windings, making a\nwalk of sixty feet in a garden of only twenty.\n\nN"}, {"chunk_id": 414, "text": "ay at first sight appear to be.

Valentine\nthen took the dictionary, and the notary watched her while she turned\nover the pages.\n\nShe passed her finger slowly down the columns, and when she came to the\nword “Will,” M. Noirtier’s eye bade her stop.\n\n“Will,” said the notary; “it is very evident that M. Noirtier is\ndesirous of making his will.”\n\n“Yes, yes, yes,” motioned the invalid.\n\n“Really, sir, you must allow that this is most extraordinary,” said the\nastonished notary, turning to M. de Villefort.\n\n“Yes,” said the procureur, “and I think the will promises to be yet\nmore extraordinary, for I cannot see how it is to be drawn up without\nthe intervention of Valentine, and she may, perhaps, be considered as\ntoo much interested in its contents to allow of her being a suitable\ninterpreter of the obscure and ill-defined wishes of her grandfather.”\n\n“No, no, no,” replied the eye of the paralytic.\n\n“What?” said Villefort, “do you mean to say that Valentine is not\ninterested in your will?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Sir,” said the notary, whose interest had been greatly excited, and\nwho had resolved on publishing far and wide the account of this\nextraordinary and picturesque scene, “what appeared so impossible to me\nan hour ago, has now become quite easy and practicable, and this may be\na perfectly valid will, provided it be read in the presence of seven\nwitnesses, approved by the testator, and sealed by the notary in the\npresence of the witnesses. As to the time, it will not require very\nmuch more than the generality of wills. There are certain forms\nnecessary to be gone through, and which are always the same. As to the\ndetails, the greater part will be furnished afterwards by the state in\nwhich we find the affairs of the testator, and by yourself, who, having\nhad the management of them, can doubtless give full information on the\nsubject. But besides all this, in order that the instrument may not be\ncontested, I am anxious to give it the greatest possible authenticity,\ntherefore, one of my colleagues will help me, and, contrary to custom,\nwill assist in the dictation of the testament. Are you satisfied, sir?”\ncontinued the notary, addressing the old man.\n\n30175m\n\n\n\n“Yes,” looked the invalid, his eye beaming with delight at the ready\ninterpretation of his meaning.\n\n“What is he going to do?” thought Villefort, whose position demanded\nmuch reserve, but who was longing to know what his father’s intentions\nwere. He left the room to give orders for another notary to be sent,\nbut Barrois, who had heard all that passed, had guessed his master’s\nwishes, and had already gone to fetch one. The procureur then told his\nwife to come up. In the course of a quarter of an hour everyone had\nassembled in the chamber of the paralytic; the second notary had also\narrived.\n\nA few words sufficed for a mutual understanding between the two\nofficers of the law.

Three dogs of wild appearance were\nstretched at their feet. The eight rowers seemed to be servants or\nslaves of the chief. They worked vigorously, and the boat ascended the\ncurrent of the Waikato with remarkable swiftness.\n\nIn the centre of this long canoe, with feet tied, but hands free, were\nten European prisoners clinging closely to each other. They were Lord\nGlenarvan and his companions.\n\n[Sidenote: A TESTING TIME.]\n\nThe evening before, the little party, led astray by the dense fog, had\nencamped in the midst of a numerous tribe of natives. About midnight,\nthe travelers, surprised in their sleep, were made prisoners and\ncarried on board the canoe. They had not yet been maltreated, but had\ntried in vain to resist. Their arms and ammunition were in the hands of\nthe savages, and their own bullets would have quickly stretched them on\nthe earth had they attempted to escape.\n\nThey were not long in learning, by the aid of a few English words which\nthe natives used, that, being driven back by the British troops, they\nwere returning, vanquished and weakened, to the regions of the upper\nWaikato. Their chief, after an obstinate resistance, in which he lost\nhis principal warriors, was now on his way to rouse again the river\ntribes. He was called Kai-Koumou, a terrible name, which signified\nin the native language \"he who eats the limbs of his enemy.\" He was\nbrave and bold, but his cruelty equaled his bravery. No pity could be\nexpected from him. His name was well known to the English soldiers, and\na price had been set upon his head by the governor of New Zealand.\n\nThis terrible catastrophe had come upon Glenarvan just as he was\nabout reaching the long-desired harbor of Auckland, whence he would\nhave returned to his native country. Yet, looking at his calm and\npassionless countenance, you could not have divined the depth of his\nanguish, for in his present critical situation he did not betray the\nextent of his misfortunes. He felt that he ought to set an example of\nfortitude to his wife and his companions, as being the husband and\nchief. Moreover, he was ready to die first for the common safety, if\ncircumstances should require it.\n\n[Sidenote: CHIEFS, CIVILIZED AND UNCIVILIZED.]\n\nHis companions were worthy of him; they shared his noble thoughts, and\ntheir calm and haughty appearance would scarcely have intimated that\nthey were being carried away to captivity and suffering. By common\nconsent, at Glenarvan's suggestion, they had resolved to feign a proud\nindifference in the presence of the savages. It was the only way of\ninfluencing those fierce natures.\n\n[Illustration: A boat might have been seen ascending the Waikato. It\nwas a canoe seventy feet long and five broad.]\n\nSince leaving the encampment, the natives, taciturn like all savages,\nhad scarcely spoken to each other. However, from a few words exchanged,\nGlenarvan perceived that they were acquainted with the English\nlanguage. He therefore resolved to question the chief in regard to the\nfate that was in store for them. Addressing Kai-Koumou, he said, in a\nfearless tone:\n\n\"Where are you taking us, chief?\"\n\nKai-Koumou gazed at him coldly without answering.\n\n\"Say, what do you expect to do with us?\" continued Glenarvan.\n\nThe chief's eyes blazed with a sudden light, and in a stern voice he\nreplied:\n\n\"To exchange you, if your friends will ransom you; to kill you, if they\nrefuse.\"\n\nGlenarvan asked no more, but hope returned to his heart. Doubtless,\nsome chiefs of the Maori tribe had fallen into the hands of the\nEnglish, and the natives would attempt to recover them by way of\nexchange; their situation, therefore, was not one for despair.\n\nMeantime the canoe rapidly ascended the river. Paganel, whose\nchangeable disposition carried him from one extreme to another, had\nregained his hopefulness. He believed that the Maoris were sparing them\nthe fatigue of their journey to the English settlements, a"}, {"chunk_id": 47, "text": "ough his mind.\n\n\"If Robert is still living!\" exclaimed he, with a cry of terror, \"this\nbird! Fire, my friends, fire!\"\n\nBut he was too late. The condor had disappeared behind the lofty\nboulders. A second passed that seemed an eternity. Then the enormous\nbird reappeared, heavily laden, and rising slowly.\n\nA cry of horror was uttered. In the claws of the condor an inanimate\nbody was seen suspended and dangling. It was Robert Grant. The bird had\nraised him by his garments, and was now hovering in mid-air at least\none hundred and fifty feet above the encampment. He had perceived the\ntravelers, and was violently striving to escape with his heavy prey.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"May Robert's body be dashed upon these rocks,\" cried Glenarvan,\n\"rather than serve----\"\n\nHe did not finish, but, seizing Wilson's rifle, attempted to take aim\nat the condor. But his arm trembled; he could not sight the piece. His\neyes were dimmed.\n\n\"Let me try,\" said the major.\n\nWith clear eye, steady hand, and motionless body, he aimed at the bird,\nthat was already three hundred feet above him. But he had not pressed\nthe trigger, when a report resounded in the valley. A light smoke\ncurled up between two rocks, and the condor, shot in the head, fell,\nslowly turning, sustained by his broad outspread wings. He had not\nreleased his prey, and at last reached the ground, ten paces from the\nbanks of the stream.\n\n\"Quick! quick!\" said Glenarvan; and without seeking whence this\nprovidential shot had come, he rushed towards the condor. His\ncompanions closely followed him.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Sidenote: \"THE LOST IS FOUND.\"]\n\nWhen they arrived the bird was dead, and the body of Robert was hidden\nunder its great wings. Glenarvan threw himself upon the child, released\nhim from the talons of the condor, stretched him on the grass, and\npressed his ear to his breast.\n\nNever did a wilder cry of joy issue from human lips than when Glenarvan\nrose, exclaiming:\n\n\"He lives! he lives!\"\n\nIn an instant Robert was stripped of his garments, and his face bathed\nwith fresh water. He made a movement, opened his eyes, looked around,\nand uttered a few words:\n\n\"You, my lord--my father!----\"\n\nGlenarvan could not speak. Emotion stifled him, and, kneeling, he wept\nbeside this child so miraculously saved.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\nTHALCAVE.\n\n\nAfter the great danger that he had just escaped, Robert incurred\nanother, no less great,--that of being overwhelmed with caresses.\nHowever feeble he was still, not one of these good people could refrain\nfrom pressing him to his heart. But it must be confessed that these\nwell-meant embraces are not fatal, for the boy did not die.\n\nWhen his rescue was certain, thought reverted to his rescuer, and the\nmajor very naturally thought of looking around him. Fifty paces from\nthe stream, a man of lofty stature was standing, motionless, on one\nof the first ledges of the mountain. A long gun lay at his feet. This\nindividual, who had so suddenly appeared, had broad shoulders, and\nlong hair tied with leathern thongs. His height exceeded six feet, and\nhis bronzed face was red between his eyes and mouth, black below his\neyelids, and white on his forehead. After the manner of the Patagonians\nof the frontiers, the native wore a splendid cloak, decorated with\nred arabesques, made of the skin of a guanaco, its silky fur turned\noutward, and sewed with ostrich-tendons. Under his cloak a tippet of\nfox-skin encircled his neck and terminated in a point in front. At his\ngirdle hung a little bag containing the colors with which he painted\nhis face. His leggings were of ox-hide, and fastened to the ankle with\nstraps regularly crossed.\n\nThe figure of this Patagonian was fine, and his face denoted real\nintelligence in spite of the colors that adorned (!) it. He waited in\nan attitude full of dignity, and, seeing him so motionless and stern on\nhis pedestal of rocks, you would have taken him for a statue.\n\nThe major, as soon as he perceived him, pointed him out to Glenarvan,\nwho hastened towards him. The Patag"}, {"chunk_id": 86, "text": "ers,\nfamilies, genera, sub-genera, species----\"\n\n\"Very fine!\" said MacNabb. \"I should not have thought of that! If I\nhad been one of Noah's companions at the time of the deluge, I should\ncertainly have prevented that imprudent patriarch from putting into\nthe ark pairs of tigers, lions, bears, panthers, and other animals as\ndestructive as they were useless.\"\n\n\"Should you have done so?\" inquired Paganel.\n\n\"I should.\"\n\n\"Well, you would have been wrong in a zoological point of view.\"\n\n\"But not in a human one.\"\n\n\"This is shocking,\" continued Paganel; \"for my part, I should have\npreserved all the animals before the deluge of which we are so\nunfortunately deprived.\"\n\n\"I tell you,\" replied MacNabb, \"that Noah was right in abandoning them\nto their fate, admitting that they lived in his time.\"\n\n\"I tell you that Noah was wrong,\" retorted Paganel, \"and deserves the\nmalediction of scholars to the end of time.\"\n\nThe listeners to this argument could not help laughing at seeing the\ntwo friends dispute about what Noah ought to have done or left undone.\nThe major, who had never argued with any one in his life, contrary to\nall his principles, was every day at war with Paganel, who must have\nparticularly excited him.\n\nGlenarvan, according to his custom, interrupted the debate, and said,--\n\n[Sidenote: WANTED, A JAGUAR!]\n\n\"However much it is to be regretted, in a scientific or human point of\nview, that we are deprived of ferocious animals, we must be resigned\nto-day to their absence. Paganel could not hope to encounter any in\nthis aerial forest.\"\n\n\"No,\" replied the geographer, \"although we beat the bush. It is a pity,\nfor it would have been a glorious hunt. A ferocious man-eater like the\njaguar! With one blow of his paw he can twist the neck of a horse. When\nhe has tasted human flesh, however, he returns to it ravenously. What\nhe likes best is the Indian, then the negro, then the mulatto, and then\nthe white man.\"\n\n\"However that may be, my good Paganel,\" said Glenarvan, \"so long as\nthere are no Indians, mulattoes, or negroes among us, I rejoice in\nthe absence of your dear jaguars. Our situation is not, of course, so\nagreeable----\"\n\n\"What!\" cried Paganel, \"you complain of your lot?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" replied Glenarvan. \"Are you at your ease in these\nuncomfortable and uncushioned branches?\"\n\n\"I have never been more so, even in my own study. We lead the life of\nbirds; we sing and flutter about. I almost think that men were destined\nto live in the trees.\"\n\n\"They only want wings,\" said the major.\n\n\"They will make them some day.\"\n\n\"In the meantime,\" replied Glenarvan, \"permit me, my dear friend, to\nprefer the sand of a park, the floor of a house, or the deck of a\nvessel to this aerial abode.\"\n\n\"Glenarvan,\" said Paganel, \"we must take things as they come. If\nfavorable, so much the better; if unfavorable, we must not mind it. I\nsee you long for the comforts of Malcolm Castle.\"\n\n\"No, but----\"\n\n\"I am certain that Robert is perfectly happy,\" interrupted Paganel, to\nsecure one advocate, at least, of his theories.\n\n\"Yes, Monsieur Paganel!\" cried the boy, in a joyful tone.\n\n\"It is natural at his age,\" replied Glenarvan.\n\n\"And at mine,\" added the geographer. \"The less ease we have, the fewer\nwants; the fewer wants, the happier we are.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the major, \"here is Paganel going to make an attack upon\nriches and gilded splendor.\"\n\n\"No, my dear major,\" continued Paganel; \"but, if you wish, I will tell\nyou, in this connection, a little Arab story that occurs to me.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, Monsieur Paganel,\" cried Robert.\n\n\"And what will your story prove?\" asked the major.\n\n\"What all stories prove, my brave companion.\"\n\n\"Not much, then,\" replied MacNabb. \"But go on, Scheherezade, and tell\none of those stories that you relate so well.\"\n\n\"There was once upon a time,\" said Paganel, \"a son of the great\nHaroun-al-Raschid who was not happy.

Paganel, whose\nchangeable disposition carried him from one extreme to another, had\nregained his hopefulness. He believed that the Maoris were sparing them\nthe fatigue of their journey to the English settlements, and that they\nwere certain to arrive at their destination. He was, therefore, quite\nresigned to his lot, and traced on his map the course of the Waikato\nacross the plains and valleys of the province. Lady Helena and Mary\nGrant, suppressing their terror, conversed in low tones with Glenarvan,\nand the most skillful physiognomist could not have detected on their\nfaces the anxiety of their hearts.\n\nThe Waikato River is worshiped by the natives, as Paganel knew, and\nEnglish and German naturalists have never ascended beyond its junction\nwith the Waipa. Whither did Kai-Koumou intend to take his captives?\nThe geographer could not have guessed if the word \"Taupo,\" frequently\nrepeated, had not attracted his attention. By consulting his map,\nhe saw that this name was applied to a celebrated lake in the most\nmountainous part of the island, and that from it the Waikato flows.\n\nPaganel, addressing Captain Mangles in French, so as not to be\nunderstood by the savages, asked him how fast the canoe was going. The\ncaptain thought about three miles an hour.\n\n\"Then,\" replied the geographer, \"if we do not travel during the night,\nour voyage to the lake will last about four days.\"\n\n\"But whereabouts are the English garrisons?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"It is difficult to say,\" replied Paganel. \"At all events, the war\nmust have reached the province of Taranaki, and probably the troops\nare collected beyond the mountains, on the side of the lake where the\nhabitations of the savages are concentrated.\"\n\n\"God grant it!\" said Lady Helena.\n\nGlenarvan cast a sorrowful glance at his young wife and Mary Grant,\nexposed to the mercy of these fierce natives, and captives in a wild\ncountry, far from all human assistance. But he saw that he was watched\nby Kai-Koumou, and, not wishing to show that one of the captives was\nhis wife, he prudently kept his thoughts to himself, and gazed at the\nbanks of the river with apparent indifference.\n\n[Sidenote: ACCESSIONS, AND PROGRESS.]\n\nThe sun was just sinking below the horizon as the canoe ran upon a bank\nof pumice-stones, which the Waikato carries with it from its source\nin the volcanic mountains. Several trees grew here, as if designed to\nshelter an encampment. Kai-Koumou landed his prisoners.\n\nThe men had their hands tied, the ladies were free. All were placed\nin the centre of the encampment, around which large fires formed an\nimpassable barrier.\n\nBefore Kai-Koumou had informed his captives of his intention to\nexchange them, Glenarvan and Captain Mangles had discussed various\nmethods of recovering their liberty. What they could not venture in the\nboat they hoped to attempt on land, at the hour for encamping, under\ncover of the night.\n\nBut since Glenarvan's conversation with the chief, it seemed wise to\nabandon this design. They must be patient. It was the most prudent\nplan. The exchange offered chances that neither an open attack nor a\nflight across these unknown regions could afford. Many circumstances\nmight indeed arise that would delay, and even prevent, such a\ntransaction; but still it was better to await the result. What,\nmoreover, could ten defenceless men do against thirty well-armed\nsavages? Besides, Glenarvan thought it likely that Kai-Koumou's tribe\nhad lost some chief of high rank whom they were particularly anxious to\nrecover; and he was not mistaken.\n\nThe next day the canoe ascended the river with increased swiftness.\nIt stopped for a moment at the junction of a small river which wound\nacross the plains on the right bank.

Mr. Olbinett prepared supper with his usual promptness, and the\ntravelers--some in the cart and others under the tent--were not long\nin falling asleep, in spite of the dismal howlings of the dingos,--the\njackals of Australia.\n\nThe next morning Glenarvan and his companions were greeted with a\nmagnificent sight. As far as the eye could reach, the landscape seemed\nto be one flowery meadow in spring-like luxuriance. The delicate blue\nof the slender-leaved flax-plant mingled with the flaming scarlet\nof the acanthus, and the ground was clothed with a rich carpet of\ngreen and crimson. After a rapid journey of about ten miles, the cart\nwound through tall groups of acacias, mimosas, and white gum-trees.\nThe vegetable kingdom on these plains did not show itself ungrateful\ntowards the orb of day, and repaid in perfume and color what it\nreceived in sunshine.\n\nAs for the animal kingdom, it was no less lavish of its products.\nSeveral cassowaries bounded over the plain with unapproachable\nswiftness. The major was skillful enough to shoot a very rare bird,--a\n\"jabiru,\" or giant crane. This creature was five feet high; and its\nbroad, black, sharp conical beak measured eighteen inches in length.\nThe violet and purple colors of its head contrasted strongly with the\nlustrous green of its neck, the dazzling white of its breast, and the\nvivid red of its long legs.\n\n[Sidenote: A FOUR-FOOTED ARMY.]\n\nThis bird was greatly admired, and the major would have won the honors\nof the day, if young Robert had not encountered a few miles farther\non, and bravely vanquished, an unsightly beast, half hedgehog, half\nant-eater, a chaotic-looking animal, like those of pre-historic\nperiods. A long, glutinous, extensible tongue hung out of its mouth,\nand fished up the ants that constituted its principal food. Of course,\nPaganel wished to carry away the hideous creature, and proposed to\nput it in the baggage-room; but Mr. Olbinett opposed this with such\nindignation that the geographer gave up his idea of preserving this\ncurious specimen.\n\nHitherto few colonists or squatters had been seen. The country seemed\ndeserted. There was not even the trace of a native; for the savage\ntribes wander farther to the north, over the immense wastes watered by\nthe Darling and the Murray. But now a singular sight was presented to\nGlenarvan's party. They were fortunate enough to see one of those vast\nherds of cattle which bold speculators bring from the eastern mountains\nto the provinces of Victoria and South Australia.\n\nAbout four o'clock in the afternoon, Captain Mangles descried, three\nmiles in advance, an enormous column of dust that spread along the\nhorizon.

Here another canoe, with ten\nnatives on board, joined Kai-Koumou. The warriors merely exchanged\nsalutations, and then continued their course. The new-comers had\nrecently fought against the English troops, as could be seen by their\ntattered garments, their gory weapons, and the wounds that still bled\nbeneath their rags. They were gloomy and taciturn, and, with the\nindifference common to all savage races, paid no attention to the\ncaptives.\n\nTowards evening Kai-Koumou landed at the foot of the mountains,\nwhose nearer ridges reached precipitously to the river-bank. Here\ntwenty natives, who had disembarked from their canoes, were making\npreparations for the night. Fires blazed beneath the trees. A chief,\nequal in rank to Kai-Koumou, advanced with measured pace, and, rubbing\nhis nose against that of the latter, saluted him cordially. The\nprisoners were stationed in the centre of the encampment, and guarded\nwith extreme vigilance.\n\nThe next morning the ascent of the Waikato was resumed. Other boats\ncame from various affluents of the river. Sixty warriors, evidently\nfugitives from the last insurrection, had now assembled, and were\nreturning, more or less wounded in the fray, to the mountain districts.\nSometimes a song arose from the canoes, as they advanced in single\nfile. One native struck up the patriotic ode of the mysterious \"Pihé,\"\nthe national hymn that calls the Maoris to battle. The full and\nsonorous voice of the singer waked the echoes of the mountains; and\nafter each stanza his comrades struck their breasts, and sang the\nwarlike verses in chorus. Then they seized their oars again, and the\ncanoes were headed up stream.\n\nDuring the day a singular sight enlivened the voyage. About four\no'clock the canoe, without lessening its speed, guided by the steady\nhand of the chief, dashed through a narrow gorge. Eddies broke\nviolently against numerous small islands, which rendered navigation\nexceeding dangerous. Never could it be more hazardous to capsize, for\nthe banks afforded no refuge, and whoever had set foot on the porous\ncrust of the shore would probably have perished. At this point the\nriver flowed between warm springs, oxide of iron colored the muddy\nground a brilliant red, and not a yard of firm earth could be seen.\nThe air was heavy with a penetrating sulphureous odor. The natives did\nnot regard it, but the captives were seriously annoyed by the noxious\nvapors exhaled from the fissures of the soil and the bubbles that\nburst and discharged their gaseous contents. Yet, however disagreeable\nthese emanations were, the eye could not but admire this magnificent\nspectacle.\n\n[Illustration: At this point the river flowed between warm springs, and\nnot a yard of firm earth could be seen.]\n\nThe canoes soon after entered a dense cloud of white smoke, whose\nwreaths rose in gradually decreasing circles above the river. On the\nshores a hundred geysers, some shooting forth masses of vapor, and\nothers overflowing in liquid columns, varied their effects, like the\njets and cascades of a fountain. It seemed as though some engineer was\ndirecting at his pleasure the outflowings of these springs, as the\nwaters and vapor, mingling in the air, formed rainbows in the sunbeams.\n\nFor two miles the canoes glided within this vapory atmosphere,\nenveloped in its warm waves that rolled along the surface of the water.\nThen the sulphureous smoke disappeared, and a pure swift current of\nfresh air refreshed the panting voyagers. The region of the springs was\npassed. Before the cl"}, {"chunk_id": 194, "text": "\nshoulders and surveyed the fortification.

The savages, men, women,\nand children, to the number of several hundreds, assembled in the pah,\nsilent and calm. Kai-Koumou came out of his house, and, surrounded by\nthe principal warriors of his tribe, took his place on a mound several\nfeet high in the centre of the fortification. The crowd of natives\nformed a semicircle around him, and the whole assembly preserved\nabsolute silence.\n\nAt a sign from the chief, a warrior advanced towards the temple.\n\n\"Remember!\" said Lady Helena to her husband.\n\nGlenarvan clasped his wife to his heart. At this moment Mary Grant\napproached John Mangles.\n\n\"Lord and Lady Glenarvan,\" said she, \"I think that, if a wife can die\nby the hand of her husband to escape a degrading existence, a maiden\ncan likewise die by the hand of her lover. John (for I may tell you\nat this critical moment), have I not long been your betrothed in the\ndepths of your heart? May I rely upon you, dear John, as Lady Helena\ndoes upon Lord Glenarvan?\"\n\n\"Mary!\" cried the young captain, in terror. \"Ah! dear Mary----\"\n\nHe could not finish: the mat was raised, and the captives were dragged\ntowards Kai-Koumou. The two women were resigned to their fate, while\nthe men concealed their anguish beneath a calmness that showed\nsuperhuman self-control.

Glenarvan cast\na rapid glance around him. The crowd opened, and a warrior, dripping\nwith sweat and overcome with fatigue, appeared.\n\nAs soon as Kai-Koumou perceived him, he said in English, evidently that\nhe might be understood by the captives:\n\n\"You come from the camp of the pale-faces?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the Maori.\n\n\"You saw the prisoner, our Tohonga?\"\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n\"Is he living?\"\n\n\"He is dead! The English have shot him.\"\n\nThe fate of Glenarvan and his companions was settled.\n\n\"You shall all die to-morrow at daybreak!\" cried Kai-Koumou.\n\nThe unfortunates were therefore to suffer a common death. Lady Helena\nand Mary Grant raised towards heaven a look of thankfulness.\n\nThe captives were not taken back to the temple. They were to attend\nthat day the funeral of the dead chief, and the bloody ceremonies\nconnected therewith. A party of natives conducted them to the foot of\nan enormous koudi, where these guardians remained without losing sight\nof their prisoners. The rest of the tribe, absorbed in their official\nmourning, seemed to have forgotten them.\n\nThe customary three days had elapsed since the death of Kara-Tété. The\nsoul of the deceased had therefore forever abandoned its mortal abode.\nThe sacred rites began.\n\nThe body was carried to a small mound in the centre of the\nfortification, clothed in splendid costume, and enveloped in a\nmagnificent flaxen mat. The head was adorned with plumes, and wore a\ncrown of green leaves. The face, arms, and breast had been rubbed with\noil, and therefore showed no mortification.\n\nThe parents and friends of the deceased came to the foot of the\nmound, and all at once, as if some director were beating time to a\nfuneral dirge, a great concert of cries, groans, and sobs arose on the\nair. They mourned the dead in plaintive and modulated cadences. His\nrelations struck their heads together; his kinswomen lacerated their\nfaces with their nails, and showed themselves more lavish of blood than\nof tears. These unfortunate females conscientiously fulfilled their\nbarbarous duty.\n\nBut these demonstrations were not enough to appease the soul of the\ndeceased, whose wrath would doubtless hav"}, {"chunk_id": 186, "text": "ome still suffering from recent wounds, stood in perfect immobility,\nenveloped in their flaxen mantles. Three dogs of wild appearance were\nstretched at their feet. The eight rowers seemed to be servants or\nslaves of the chief. They worked vigorously, and the boat ascended the\ncurrent of the Waikato with remarkable swiftness.\n\nIn the centre of this long canoe, with feet tied, but hands free, were\nten European prisoners clinging closely to each other. They were Lord\nGlenarvan and his companions.\n\n[Sidenote: A TESTING TIME.]\n\nThe evening before, the little party, led astray by the dense fog, had\nencamped in the midst of a numerous tribe of natives. About midnight,\nthe travelers, surprised in their sleep, were made prisoners and\ncarried on board the canoe. They had not yet been maltreated, but had\ntried in vain to resist. Their arms and ammunition were in the hands of\nthe savages, and their own bullets would have quickly stretched them on\nthe earth had they attempted to escape.\n\nThey were not long in learning, by the aid of a few English words which\nthe natives used, that, being driven back by the British troops, they\nwere returning, vanquished and weakened, to the regions of the upper\nWaikato. Their chief, after an obstinate resistance, in which he lost\nhis principal warriors, was now on his way to rouse again the river\ntribes. He was called Kai-Koumou, a terrible name, which signified\nin the native language \"he who eats the limbs of his enemy.\" He was\nbrave and bold, but his cruelty equaled his bravery. No pity could be\nexpected from him. His name was well known to the English soldiers, and\na price had been set upon his head by the governor of New Zealand.\n\nThis terrible catastrophe had come upon Glenarvan just as he was\nabout reaching the long-desired harbor of Auckland, whence he would\nhave returned to his native country. Yet, looking at his calm and\npassionless countenance, you could not have divined the depth of his\nanguish, for in his present critical situation he did not betray the\nextent of his misfortunes. He felt that he ought to set an example of\nfortitude to his wife and his companions, as being the husband and\nchief. Moreover, he was ready to die first for the common safety, if\ncircumstances should require it.\n\n[Sidenote: CHIEFS, CIVILIZED AND UNCIVILIZED.]\n\nHis companions were worthy of him; they shared his noble thoughts, and\ntheir calm and haughty appearance would scarcely have intimated that\nthey were being carried away to captivity and suffering. By common\nconsent, at Glenarvan's suggestion, they had resolved to feign a proud\nindifference in the presence of the savages. It was the only way of\ninfluencing those fierce natures.\n\n[Illustration: A boat might have been seen ascending the Waikato. It\nwas a canoe seventy feet long and five broad.]\n\nSince leaving the encampment, the natives, taciturn like all savages,\nhad scarcely spoken to each other. However, from a few words exchanged,\nGlenarvan perceived that they were acquainted with the English\nlanguage. He therefore resolved to question the chief in regard to the\nfate that was in store for them. Addressing Kai-Koumou, he said, in a\nfearless tone:\n\n\"Where are you taking us, chief?\"\n\nKai-Koumou gazed at him coldly without answering.\n\n\"Say, what do you expect to do with us?\" continued Glenarvan.\n\nThe chief's eyes blazed with a sudden light, and in a stern voice he\nreplied:\n\n\"To exchange you, if your friends will ransom you; to kill you, if they\nrefuse.\"\n\nGlenarvan asked no more, but hope returned to his heart. Doubtless,\nsome chiefs of the Maori tribe had fallen into the hands of the\nEnglish, and the natives would attempt to recover them by way of\nexchange; their situation, therefore, was not one for despair.\n\nMeantime the canoe rapidly ascended the river.

He allowed this bloody orgy an hour to reach its utmost\nintensity. The last act of the funeral was played with the usual rites.\n\nThe bodies of Kara-Tété and his wife were taken up, and their limbs\nbent and gathered against the stomach, according to the New Zealand\ncustom. The place for the tomb had been chosen outside of the\nfortification, about two miles distant, on the summit of a small\nmountain, called Maunganamu, situated on the right shore of the lake.\n\nThither the bodies were to be carried. Two very rude palanquins, or\nrather litters, were brought to the foot of the mound. The corpses,\nfolded together, in a sitting posture, and tied in their clothes by a\ngirdle of withes, were placed on this primitive bier.

Finally they perceived it again winding along\nthe mountain paths.

The relatives had not forgotten that the\n\"waidoua\" (the spirit of the dead) feeds on substantial nourishment\nlike the body during this perishable life.

Paganel, whose\nchangeable disposition carried him from one extreme to another, had\nregained his hopefulness. He believed that the Maoris were sparing them\nthe fatigue of their journey to the English settlements, and that they\nwere certain to arrive at their destination. He was, therefore, quite\nresigned to his lot, and traced on his map the course of the Waikato\nacross the plains and valleys of the province. Lady Helena and Mary\nGrant, suppressing their terror, conversed in low tones with Glenarvan,\nand the most skillful physiognomist could not have detected on their\nfaces the anxiety of their hearts.\n\nThe Waikato River is worshiped by the natives, as Paganel knew, and\nEnglish and German naturalists have never ascended beyond its junction\nwith the Waipa. Whither did Kai-Koumou intend to take his captives?\nThe geographer could not have guessed if the word \"Taupo,\" frequently\nrepeated, had not attracted his attention. By consulting his map,\nhe saw that this name was applied to a celebrated lake in the most\nmountainous part of the island, and that from it the Waikato flows.\n\nPaganel, addressing Captain Mangles in French, so as not to be\nunderstood by the savages, asked him how fast the canoe was going. The\ncaptain thought about three miles an hour.\n\n\"Then,\" replied the geographer, \"if we do not travel during the night,\nour voyage to the lake will last about four days.\"\n\n\"But whereabouts are the English garrisons?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"It is difficult to say,\" replied Paganel. \"At all events, the war\nmust have reached the province of Taranaki, and probably the troops\nare collected beyond the mountains, on the side of the lake where the\nhabitations of the savages are concentrated.\"\n\n\"God grant it!\" said Lady Helena.\n\nGlenarvan cast a sorrowful glance at his young wife and Mary Grant,\nexposed to the mercy of these fierce natives, and captives in a wild\ncountry, far from all human assistance. But he saw that he was watched\nby Kai-Koumou, and, not wishing to show that one of the captives was\nhis wife, he prudently kept his thoughts to himself, and gazed at the\nbanks of the river with apparent indifference.\n\n[Sidenote: ACCESSIONS, AND PROGRESS.]\n\nThe sun was just sinking below the horizon as the canoe ran upon a bank\nof pumice-stones, which the Waikato carries with it from its source\nin the volcanic mountains. Several trees grew here, as if designed to\nshelter an encampment. Kai-Koumou landed his prisoners.\n\nThe men had their hands tied, the ladies were free. All were placed\nin the centre of the encampment, around which large fires formed an\nimpassable barrier.\n\nBefore Kai-Koumou had informed his captives of his intention to\nexchange them, Glenarvan and Captain Mangles had discussed various\nmethods of recovering their liberty. What they could not venture in the\nboat they hoped to attempt on land, at the hour for encamping, under\ncover of the night.\n\nBut since Glenarvan's conversation with the chief, it seemed wise to\nabandon this design. They must be patient. It was the most prudent\nplan. The exchange offered chances that neither an open attack nor a\nflight across these unknown regions could afford. Many circumstances\nmight indeed arise that would delay, and even prevent, such a\ntransaction; but still it was better to await the result. What,\nmoreover, could ten defenceless men do against thirty well-armed\nsavages? Besides, Glenarvan thought it likely that Kai-Koumou's tribe\nhad lost some chief of high rank whom they were particularly anxious to\nrecover; and he was not mistaken.\n\nThe next day the canoe ascended the river with increased swiftness.\nIt stopped for a moment at the junction of a small river which wound\nacross the plains on the right bank.

Look!\"\n\nAnd all saw, indeed, that an inexplicable change had taken place in the\nmovements of the Maoris. Their pursuit had been suddenly interrupted.\nTheir ascent of the mountain had ceased, as if by an imperious\ninterdict. The crowd of natives had checked their swiftness, and\nhalted, like the waves of the sea before an impassable rock.\n\nAll the savages, thirsting for blood, were now ranged along the foot\nof the mountain, yelling, gesticulating, and brandishing guns and\nhatchets; but they did not advance a single foot. Their dogs, like\nthemselves, as though chained to earth, howled with rage.\n\nWhat was the difficulty? What invisible power restrained the natives?\nThe fugitives gazed without comprehending, fearing that the charm that\nenchained Kai-Koumou's tribe would dissolve.\n\nSuddenly Captain Mangles uttered a cry that caused his companions to\nturn. He pointed to a little fortress at the summit of the peak.\n\n\"The tomb of the chief Kara-Tété!\" cried Robert.\n\n\"Are you in earnest?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"Yes, my lord, it is the tomb; I recognize it.\"\n\nRobert was right. Fifty feet above, at the extreme point of the\nmountain, stood a small palisaded inclosure of freshly-painted stakes.\nGlenarvan, likewise, recognized the sepulchre of the Maori chief. In\ntheir wanderings they had come to the top of the Maunganamu, where\nKara-Tété had been buried.\n\nFollowed by his companions, he climbed the sides of the peak, to the\nvery foot of the tomb. A large opening, covered with mats, formed the\nentrance. Glenarvan was about to enter, when, all at once, he started\nback suddenly.\n\n\"A savage!\" said he.\n\n\"A savage in this tomb?\" inquired the major.\n\n\"Yes, MacNabb.\"\n\n\"What matter? Let us enter.\"\n\nGlenarvan, the major, Robert, and Captain Mangles passed into the\ninclosure. A Maori was there, clad in a great flax mantle. The darkness\nof the sepulchre did not permit them to distinguish his features. He\nappeared very calm, and was eating his breakfast with the most perfect\nindifference.\n\nGlenarvan was about to address him, when the native, anticipating him,\nsaid, in an amiable tone, and in excellent English:\n\n\"Be seated, my dear lord; breakfast is awaiting you.\"\n\nIt was Paganel. At his voice all rushed into the tomb, and gazed with\nwonder at the worthy geographer. Paganel was found! The common safety\nwas represented in him. They were going to question him: they wished\nto know how and why he was on the top of the mountain; but Glenarvan\nchecked this unseasonable curiosity.\n\n[Illustration: \"Be seated, my dear lord; breakfast is awaiting you.\"]\n\n\"The savages!\" said he.\n\n\"The savages,\" replied Paganel, shrugging his shoulders, \"are\nindividuals whom I supremely despise.\"\n\n\"But can they not----?\"\n\n\"They! the imbeciles! Come and see them.\"\n\nEach followed Paganel, who issued from the tomb. The Maoris were in the\nsame place, surrounding the foot of the peak, and uttering terrible\ncries.\n\n\"Cry and howl till you are tired, miserable creatures!\" said Paganel.\n\"I defy you to climb this mountain!\"\n\n\"And why?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"Because the chief is buried here; this tomb protects us, and the\nmountain is tabooed.\"\n\n\"Tabooed?\"\n\n\"Yes, my friends; and that is why I took refuge here, as in one of\nthose asylums of the Middle Ages, open to unfortunates.\"\n\nIndeed, the mountain was tabooed, and by this consecration had become\ninaccessible by the superstitious savages.\n\nThe safety of the fugitives was not yet certain, but there was a\nsalutary respite, of which they strove to take advantage. Glenarvan, a\nprey to unspeakable emotion, did not venture a word; while the major\nnodded his head with an air of genuine satisfaction.\n\n\"And now, my friends,\" said Paganel, \"if these brutes expect us to test\ntheir patience they are mistaken.

They dug a sort of\ngroove for it down the side of the mountain, that it might slide on an\ninclined plane.\n\nAs their action increased, the trembling of the earth became more\nviolent. Hollow rumblings and hissings sounded under the thin\ncrust. But the bold experimenters, like real Vulcans, governing the\nunderground fires, worked on in silence. Several cracks and a few gusts\nof hot smoke warned them that their position was becoming dangerous.\nBut a final effort detached the block, which glided down the slope of\nthe mountain and disappeared.\n\nThe thin covering at once yielded. An incandescent column poured forth\ntowards the sky with loud explosions, while streams of boiling water\nand lava rolled towards the encampment of the natives and the valleys\nbelow. The whole peak trembled, and you might almost have thought that\nit was disappearing in a general conflagration.\n\nGlenarvan and his companions had scarcely time to escape the shock of\nthe eruption. They fled to the inclosure of the tomb, but not without\nreceiving a few scalding drops of the water, which bubbled and exhaled\na strong sulphureous odor.\n\nThen mud, lava, and volcanic fragments mingled in the scene of\ndevastation. Torrents of flame furrowed the sides of the Maunganamu.\nThe adjoining mountains glowed in the light of the eruption, and the\ndeep valleys were illumined with a vivid brightness.\n\nThe savages were soon aroused, both by the noise and the heat\nof the lava that flowed in a scalding tide through the midst of\ntheir encampment. Those whom the fiery flood had not reached fled,\nand ascended the surrounding hills, turning and gazing back at\nthis terrific phenomenon, with which their god, in his wrath, had\noverwhelmed the desecrators of the sacred mountain; while at certain\nmoments they were heard howling their consecratory cry:\n\n\"Taboo! taboo! taboo!\"\n\n[Illustration: The fugitives made themselves levers out of the stakes\nof the tomb.]\n\n[Illustration: An incandescent column poured forth towards the sky with\nloud explosions, while streams of boiling water and lava rolled towards\nthe encampment of the natives.]\n\nMeantime an enormous quantity of vapor, melted stones, and lava had\nescaped from the crater. It was no longer a simple geyser. All this\nvolcanic effervescence had hitherto been confined beneath the crust of\nthe peak, since the outlets of Tangariro sufficed for its expansion;\nbut as a new opening had been made, it had rushed forth with extreme\nviolence.\n\nAll night long, during the storm that raged above and below, the peak\nwas shaken with a commotion that could not but alarm Glenarvan. The\nprisoners, concealed behind the palisade of the tomb, watched the\nfearful progress of the outbreak.\n\nMorning came. The fury of the volcano had not moderated. Thick,\nyellowish vapors mingled with the flames, and torrents of lava poured\nin every direction. Glenarvan, with eye alert and beating heart,\nglanced between the interstices of the inclosure, and surveyed the camp\nof the Maoris.\n\nThe natives had fled to the neighboring plateaus, beyond the reach of\nthe volcano. Several corpses, lying at the foot of the peak, had been\ncharred by the fire. Farther on, towards the pah, the lava had consumed\na number of huts, that were still smoking. The savages, in scattered\ngroups, were gazing at the vapory summit of Maunganamu with religious\nawe.\n\nKai-Koumou came into the midst of his warriors, and Glenarvan\nrecognized him. The chief advanced to the base of the peak, on the side\nspared by the eruption, but did not cross the first slopes. Here, with\noutstretched arms, like a sorcerer exorcising, he made a few grimaces,\nthe meaning of which did not escape the prisoners. As Paganel had\nforeseen, Kai-Koumou was invoking upon the mountain a more rigorous\ntaboo.\n\nSoon after, the natives descended, in single file, the winding paths\nthat led towards the pah.\n\n[Sidenote: A WEARY WAITING.]\n\n\"They are going!\" cried Glenarvan. \"They are abandoning their post!\nGod be thanked!

A second line of stakes, and then a fence of osiers,\npierced with loop-holes, inclosed the inner space, the court-yard of\nthe pah, in which stood several Maori tents, and forty huts which were\nsymmetrically arranged.\n\nOn their arrival, the captives were terribly impressed at sight of\nthe heads that ornamented the stakes of the second inclosure. Lady\nHelena and Mary Grant turned away their eyes with more of disgust than\nterror. These heads had most of them belonged to hostile chiefs, fallen\nin battle, whose bodies had served as food for the conquerors. The\ngeographer knew them to be such by their hollow and eyeless sockets!\n\nIn Kai-Koumou's pah only the heads of his enemies formed this frightful\nmuseum; and here, doubtless, more than one English skull had served to\nincrease the size of the chief's collection.\n\nHis hut, among those belonging to warriors of lower rank, stood at the\nrear of the pah, in front of a large open terrace. This structure was\nbuilt of stakes, interlaced with branches, and lined inside with flax\nmatting.\n\nOnly one opening gave access to the dwelling. A thick curtain, made\nof a vegetable tissue, served as a door. The roof projected so as to\nform a water-shed. Several faces, carved at the ends of the rafters,\nadorned the hut, and the curtain was covered with various imitations\nof foliage, symbolical figures, monsters, and graceful sculpturing,\na curious piece of work, fashioned by the scissors of the native\ndecorators.\n\n[Sidenote: FEMININE ORATORY.]\n\nInside of the habitation the floor was made of hard-trodden earth,\nand raised six inches above the ground. Several rush screens and some\nmattresses, covered with woven matting of long leaves and twigs,\nserved as beds. In the middle of the room a hole in a stone formed the\nfireplace, and another in the roof answered for a chimney.\n\nThe smoke, when it became sufficiently thick, perforce escaped at this\noutlet, but it of course blackened the walls of the house.\n\nOn one side of the hut were storehouses, containing the chief's\nprovisions, his harvest of flax, potatoes, and edible ferns, and\nthe ovens where the various articles of food were cooked by contact\nwith heated stones. Farther off, in small pens, pigs and goats were\nconfined, and dogs ran about seeking their scanty sustenance. They were\nrather poorly kept, for animals that formed the Maori daily food.\n\nGlenarvan and his companions had taken in the whole at a glance. They\nawaited beside an empty hut the good pleasure of the chief, exposed to\nthe insults of a crowd of old women, who surrounded them like harpies,\nand threatened them with their fists, crying and howling. Several\nEnglish words that passed their lips clearly indicated that they were\ndemanding immediate vengeance.\n\nIn the midst of these cries and threats, Lady Helena affected a\ncalmness that she could not feel in her heart. This courageous woman,\nin order that her husband's coolness might not forsake him, heroically\ncontrolled her emotions. Poor Mary Grant felt herself growing weak, and\nCaptain Mangles supported her, ready to die in her defence. The others\nendured this torrent of invectives in various ways, either indifferent\nlike the major, or increasingly annoyed like Paganel.\n\nGlenarvan, wishing to relieve Lady Helena from the assaults of these\nshrews, boldly approached Kai-Koumou, and, pointing to the hideous\nthrong, said:\n\n\"Drive them away!\"\n\nThe Maori chief gazed steadily at his prisoner without replying. Then\nwith a gesture he silenced the noisy horde. Glenarvan bowed in token of\nthanks, and slowly resumed his place among his friends.\n\nKai-Koumou, fearing an insurrection of the fanatics of his tribe, now\nled his captives to a sacred place, situated at the other end of the\npah, on the edge of a precipice.

But this is scarcely probable, especially if we play our part\nskillfully.\"\n\n\"And when shall we make this last venture?\" asked Lady Helena.\n\n\"This very evening,\" answered Paganel, \"at the hour of the greatest\ndarkness.\"\n\n\"Agreed,\" said MacNabb. \"Paganel, you are a man of genius; and although\nfrom habit I am scarcely ever enthusiastic, I will answer for your\nsuccess. Ha! these rascals! we shall perform a little miracle for them\nthat will delay their conversion a good century. May the missionaries\npardon us!\"\n\nPaganel's plan was therefore adopted, and really, with the\nsuperstitious notions of the Maoris, it might and ought to succeed.\nIt only remained to execute it. The idea was good, but in practice\ndifficult. Might not this volcano consume the audacious ones who should\ndig the crater? Could they control and direct this eruption when the\nvapors, flames, and lava should be let loose? Would it not engulf\nthe entire peak in a flood of fire? They were tampering with those\nphenomena whose absolute control is reserved for forces higher than\ntheirs.\n\nPaganel had foreseen these difficulties, but he expected to act\nprudently, and not to venture to extremes. An illusion was enough to\ndeceive the Maoris, without the awful reality of a large eruption.\n\nHow long that day seemed! Each one counted the interminable hours.\nEverything was prepared for flight. The provisions of the tomb had\nbeen divided, and made into convenient bundles. Several mats, and the\nfire-arms, which had been found in the tomb of the chief, formed light\nbaggage. Of course these preparations were made within the palisaded\ninclosure and unknown to the savages.\n\nAt six o'clock the steward served a farewell feast. Where and when they\nshould eat in the valleys no one could foretell.\n\nTwilight came on. The sun disappeared behind a bank of dense clouds of\nthreatening aspect. A few flashes illumined the horizon, and a distant\npeal of thunder rumbled along the vault of the sky. Paganel welcomed\nthe storm that came to the aid of his design.\n\nAt eight o'clock the summit of the mountain was hidden by a foreboding\ndarkness, while the sky looked terribly black, as if for a background\nto the flaming outbreak that Paganel was about to inaugurate. The\nMaoris could no longer see their prisoners. The time for action had\ncome. Rapidity was necessary, and Glenarvan, Paganel, MacNabb, Robert,\nthe steward, and the two sailors at once set to work vigorously.\n\nThe place for the crater was chosen thirty paces from Kara-Tété's tomb.\nIt was important that this structure should be spared by the eruption,\nfor otherwise the taboo would become ineffective. Paganel had observed\nan enormous block of stone, around which the vapors seemed to pour\nforth with considerable force. This rocky mass covered a small natural\ncrater in the peak, and only by its weight prevented the escape of the\nsubterranean flames. If they could succeed in overturning it, the smoke\nand lava would immediately issue through the unobstructed opening.\n\n[Sidenote: VULCANS AT WORK.]\n\nThe fugitives made themselves levers out of the stakes of the tomb, and\nwith these they vigorously attacked the ponderous mass. Under their\nunited efforts the rock was not long in moving. They dug a sort of\ngroove for it down the side of the mountain, that it might slide on an\ninclined plane.\n\nAs their action increased, the trembling of the earth became more\nviolent. Hollow rumblings and hissings sounded under the thin\ncrust. But the bold experimenters, like real Vulcans, governing the\nunderground fires, worked on in silence. Several cracks and a few gusts\nof hot smoke warned them that their position was becoming dangerous.\nBut a final effort detached the block, which gli"}]}

Glenarvan cast\na rapid glance around him. The crowd opened, and a warrior, dripping\nwith sweat and overcome with fatigue, appeared.\n\nAs soon as Kai-Koumou perceived him, he said in English, evidently that\nhe might be understood by the captives:\n\n\"You come from the camp of the pale-faces?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the Maori.\n\n\"You saw the prisoner, our Tohonga?\"\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n\"Is he living?\"\n\n\"He is dead! The English have shot him.\"\n\nThe fate of Glenarvan and his companions was settled.\n\n\"You shall all die to-morrow at daybreak!\" cried Kai-Koumou.\n\nThe unfortunates were therefore to suffer a common death. Lady Helena\nand Mary Grant raised towards heaven a look of thankfulness.\n\nThe captives were not taken back to the temple. They were to attend\nthat day the funeral of the dead chief, and the bloody ceremonies\nconnected therewith. A party of natives conducted them to the foot of\nan enormous koudi, where these guardians remained without losing sight\nof their prisoners. The rest of the tribe, absorbed in their official\nmourning, seemed to have forgotten them.\n\nThe customary three days had elapsed since the death of Kara-Tété. The\nsoul of the deceased had therefore forever abandoned its mortal abode.\nThe sacred rites began.\n\nThe body was carried to a small mound in the centre of the\nfortification, clothed in splendid costume, and enveloped in a\nmagnificent flaxen mat. The head was adorned with plumes, and wore a\ncrown of green leaves. The face, arms, and breast had been rubbed with\noil, and therefore showed no mortification.\n\nThe parents and friends of the deceased came to the foot of the\nmound, and all at once, as if some director were beating time to a\nfuneral dirge, a great concert of cries, groans, and sobs arose on the\nair. They mourned the dead in plaintive and modulated cadences. His\nrelations struck their heads together; his kinswomen lacerated their\nfaces with their nails, and showed themselves more lavish of blood than\nof tears.

But he gave\nthem a more lengthy and extended narrative of Captain Cook's voyages,\nwhich were the most important in their results as well as the most\ninteresting and tragic in many of their incidents. It was on the 6th\nof October, 1769, that this navigator first landed on the shores which\nhe visited twice afterwards, and each time added greatly to the stock\nof previous knowledge concerning these islands, their productions, and\ntheir inhabitants. By him it was first ascertained that cannibalism was\npracticed by some, if not all, of the tribes at that time; and it was\nvery evident, from the manner of Paganel's narration, that hereabout\nlay the extremely sensitive point of the worthy geographer's fears and\nforebodings. However, he was not deterred from rehearsing how one and\nanother not merely visited, but began to settle, on the island, so that\nin the treaty of 1814 it was formally recognized as belonging to Great\nBritain, and twenty years after was important enough to have a separate\nofficial and governmental establishment.\n\nPaganel also told, at great length, the tales of many of the sad\nincidents which from time to time have marked even the commercial\nintercourse between the European and the Maori; as, for instance, the\nsad tale of conflict and bloodshed connected with the death of Captain\nMarion, a French navigator, in 1772. He had landed near the spot where\nSurville had ill-treated some of the natives and traitorously seized\na son of the chief, Takouri, who yet appeared to welcome this next\nFrench visitant, though remembering none the less the terrible duty of\nvengeance which is felt by the Maori to be so binding.\n\n[Illustration: It was on the sixth of October, 1769, that this\nnavigator (Captain Cook) first landed on the shores.]\n\nFor a long time the cloak of friendship was worn by the natives, the\nmore thoroughly to lull the suspicions of the whites, and to entice a\nlarger number on shore; in which endeavor they succeeded only too well.\nThe French ships being greatly out of repair, Marion was induced to\nfell timber at some distance in the interior, and to establish in this\noccupation a great number of his men, going frequently to them, and\nremaining with them and the apparently friendly chiefs. On one of these\noccasions the Maoris fulfilled their revengeful project with a terrible\nsatisfaction to themselves. Only one man, of all those in the interior,\nmanaged to escape, the commander himself falling a prey to their\nvengeance. They then endeavored to kill the second in command, who,\nwith several others, was nearer to the shore. These, of course, at once\nstarted for their boats; breathless, they reached them, hotly pursued\nto the water's edge by the insatiate savages. Then, safe themselves,\nthe French marksmen picked off the chief, and the previous exultation\nof the aborigines was, even in the hour of their triumph, turned to\nlamentation, coupled with wonder at the terrible power of the white\nman's fire-barrel.\n\n[Illustration: Safe themselves, the French marksmen picked off the\nchief.]\n\nAll this and much more did the geographer narrate; but it must be\nconfessed that he neither spoke, nor did they listen, with the\ncomplacency evinced in his previous"}, {"chunk_id": 186, "text": "ome still suffering from recent wounds, stood in perfect immobility,\nenveloped in their flaxen mantles. Three dogs of wild appearance were\nstretched at their feet. The eight rowers seemed to be servants or\nslaves of the chief. They worked vigorously, and the boat ascended the\ncurrent of the Waikato with remarkable swiftness.\n\nIn the centre of this long canoe, with feet tied, but hands free, were\nten European prisoners clinging closely to each other. They were Lord\nGlenarvan and his companions.\n\n[Sidenote: A TESTING TIME.]\n\nThe evening before, the little party, led astray by the dense fog, had\nencamped in the midst of a numerous tribe of natives. About midnight,\nthe travelers, surprised in their sleep, were made prisoners and\ncarried on board the canoe. They had not yet been maltreated, but had\ntried in vain to resist. Their arms and ammunition were in the hands of\nthe savages, and their own bullets would have quickly stretched them on\nthe earth had they attempted to escape.\n\nThey were not long in learning, by the aid of a few English words which\nthe natives used, that, being driven back by the British troops, they\nwere returning, vanquished and weakened, to the regions of the upper\nWaikato. Their chief, after an obstinate resistance, in which he lost\nhis principal warriors, was now on his way to rouse again the river\ntribes. He was called Kai-Koumou, a terrible name, which signified\nin the native language \"he who eats the limbs of his enemy.\" He was\nbrave and bold, but his cruelty equaled his bravery. No pity could be\nexpected from him. His name was well known to the English soldiers, and\na price had been set upon his head by the governor of New Zealand.\n\nThis terrible catastrophe had come upon Glenarvan just as he was\nabout reaching the long-desired harbor of Auckland, whence he would\nhave returned to his native country. Yet, looking at his calm and\npassionless countenance, you could not have divined the depth of his\nanguish, for in his present critical situation he did not betray the\nextent of his misfortunes. He felt that he ought to set an example of\nfortitude to his wife and his companions, as being the husband and\nchief. Moreover, he was ready to die first for the common safety, if\ncircumstances should require it.\n\n[Sidenote: CHIEFS, CIVILIZED AND UNCIVILIZED.]\n\nHis companions were worthy of him; they shared his noble thoughts, and\ntheir calm and haughty appearance would scarcely have intimated that\nthey were being carried away to captivity and suffering. By common\nconsent, at Glenarvan's suggestion, they had resolved to feign a proud\nindifference in the presence of the savages. It was the only way of\ninfluencing those fierce natures.\n\n[Illustration: A boat might have been seen ascending the Waikato. It\nwas a canoe seventy feet long and five broad.]\n\nSince leaving the encampment, the natives, taciturn like all savages,\nhad scarcely spoken to each other. However, from a few words exchanged,\nGlenarvan perceived that they were acquainted with the English\nlanguage. He therefore resolved to question the chief in regard to the\nfate that was in store for them. Addressing Kai-Koumou, he said, in a\nfearless tone:\n\n\"Where are you taking us, chief?\"\n\nKai-Koumou gazed at him coldly without answering.\n\n\"Say, what do you expect to do with us?\" continued Glenarvan.\n\nThe chief's eyes blazed with a sudden light, and in a stern voice he\nreplied:\n\n\"To exchange you, if your friends will ransom you; to kill you, if they\nrefuse.\"\n\nGlenarvan asked no more, but hope returned to his heart. Doubtless,\nsome chiefs of the Maori tribe had fallen into the hands of the\nEnglish, and the natives would attempt to recover them by way of\nexchange; their situation, therefore, was not one for despair.\n\nMeantime the canoe rapidly ascended the river. Paganel, whose\nchangeable disposition carried him from one extreme to another, had\nregained his hopefulness. He believed that the Maoris were sparing them\nthe fatigue of their journey to the English settlements, a"}, {"chunk_id": 196, "text": "scene of cannibalism, which followed in all\nits horrible details.]\n\n[Illustration: The corpses, folded together, in a sitting posture,\nand tied in their clothes by a girdle of withes, were placed on this\nprimitive bier.]\n\nBut Kai-Koumou had preserved his reason in the midst of the general\nintoxication. He allowed this bloody orgy an hour to reach its utmost\nintensity. The last act of the funeral was played with the usual rites.\n\nThe bodies of Kara-Tété and his wife were taken up, and their limbs\nbent and gathered against the stomach, according to the New Zealand\ncustom. The place for the tomb had been chosen outside of the\nfortification, about two miles distant, on the summit of a small\nmountain, called Maunganamu, situated on the right shore of the lake.\n\nThither the bodies were to be carried. Two very rude palanquins, or\nrather litters, were brought to the foot of the mound. The corpses,\nfolded together, in a sitting posture, and tied in their clothes by a\ngirdle of withes, were placed on this primitive bier. Four warriors\nbore it between them, and the entire tribe, chanting the funeral hymn,\nfollowed them in procession to the place of burial.\n\nThe captives, who were always watched, saw them leave the inner\ninclosure of the pah, and then the songs and cries gradually died away.\nFor about half an hour this funeral escort continued in sight, in the\ndepths of the valley. Finally they perceived it again winding along\nthe mountain paths. The distance gave a fantastic appearance to the\nundulating movements of the long, sinuous column.\n\nThe tribe stopped at the summit of the mountain, which was eight\nhundred feet high, at the place prepared for Kara-Tété's interment.\nA common Maori would have had only a hole and a heap of stones for a\ngrave; but for a powerful and dreaded chief, destined doubtless for a\nspeedy deification, a tomb worthy of his exploits was reserved.\n\n[Sidenote: THE LAST NIGHT.]\n\nThe sepulchre had been surrounded by palisades, while stakes,\nornamented with faces reddened with ochre, stood beside the grave\nwhere the bodies were to lie. The relatives had not forgotten that the\n\"waidoua\" (the spirit of the dead) feeds on substantial nourishment\nlike the body during this perishable life. Food had therefore been\ndeposited in the inclosure, together with the weapons and clothes of\nthe deceased.\n\nNothing was wanting for the comfort of the tomb. Husband and wife were\nlaid side by side, and then covered with earth and grass after a series\nof renewed lamentations. Then the procession silently descended the\nmountain, and now no one could ascend it under penalty of death, for it\nwas tabooed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LI.\n\nSTRANGELY LIBERATED.\n\n\nJust as the sun was disappearing behind Lake Taupo, the captives were\nled back to their prison. They were not to leave it again until the\nsummit of the Wahiti mountains should kindle with the first beams of\nthe day. One night remained to prepare for death. In spite of the\nfaintness, in spite of the horror with which they were seized, they\nshared their repast in common.\n\n\"We shall need all the strength possible to face death,\" said\nGlenarvan. \"We must show these barbarians how Europeans and Christians\ncan die.\"\n\nThe meal being finished, Lady Helena repeated the evening prayer aloud,\nwhile all her companions, with uncovered heads, joined her. Having\nfulfilled this duty, and enjoyed this privilege, the prisoners embraced\neach other. Lady Helena and Mary Grant then retired to one corner of\nthe hut, and stretched themselves upon a mat.

They were servants, whom the pitiless laws of war had reduced\nto slavery. During the life of the chief they had undergone the\nseverest privations, suffered a thousand abuses, had been scantily fed,\nand compelled constantly to labor like beasts; and now, according to\nthe Maori belief, they were to continue their existence of servitude\nfor eternity.\n\nThey appeared to be resigned to their fate, and were not astonished\nat a sacrifice they had long anticipated. Their freedom from all\nbonds showed that they would meet death unresistingly. Moreover, this\ndeath was rapid, protracted sufferings were spared them. These were\nreserved for the captives who stood trembling not twenty paces distant.\nSix blows of the méré, given by six stalwart warriors, stretched the\nvictims on the ground in a pool of blood. It was the signal for a\nterrible scene of cannibalism, which followed in all its horrible\ndetails.\n\nGlenarvan and his companions, breathless with fright, strove to hide\nthis awful scene from the eyes of the two unhappy ladies. They now\nunderstood what awaited them at sunrise the next day, and what cruel\ntortures would doubtless precede such a death. They were dumb with\nhorror.\n\nThe funeral dance now began. Strong spirits, extracted from an\nindigenous plant, maddened the savages till they seemed no longer\nhuman. Would they not forget the taboo of the chief, and throw\nthemselves in their final outbreaks upon the prisoners who trembled at\ntheir frenzy?\n\n[Illustration: A terrible scene of cannibalism, which followed in all\nits horrible details.]\n\n[Illustration: The corpses, folded together, in a sitting posture,\nand tied in their clothes by a girdle of withes, were placed on this\nprimitive bier.]\n\nBut Kai-Koumou had preserved his reason in the midst of the general\nintoxication.

No native was seen; only the\nsentinels guarded in turn at the door of their prison.\n\nBut on the third day the huts were opened. The savages, men, women,\nand children, to the number of several hundreds, assembled in the pah,\nsilent and calm. Kai-Koumou came out of his house, and, surrounded by\nthe principal warriors of his tribe, took his place on a mound several\nfeet high in the centre of the fortification. The crowd of natives\nformed a semicircle around him, and the whole assembly preserved\nabsolute silence.\n\nAt a sign from the chief, a warrior advanced towards the temple.\n\n\"Remember!\" said Lady Helena to her husband.\n\nGlenarvan clasped his wife to his heart. At this moment Mary Grant\napproached John Mangles.\n\n\"Lord and Lady Glenarvan,\" said she, \"I think that, if a wife can die\nby the hand of her husband to escape a degrading existence, a maiden\ncan likewise die by the hand of her lover. John (for I may tell you\nat this critical moment), have I not long been your betrothed in the\ndepths of your heart? May I rely upon you, dear John, as Lady Helena\ndoes upon Lord Glenarvan?\"\n\n\"Mary!\" cried the young captain, in terror. \"Ah! dear Mary----\"\n\nHe could not finish: the mat was raised, and the captives were dragged\ntowards Kai-Koumou. The two women were resigned to their fate, while\nthe men concealed their anguish beneath a calmness that showed\nsuperhuman self-control. They came before the chief, who did not delay\nsentence.\n\n\"You killed Kara-Tété!\" said he to Glenarvan.\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n[Sidenote: THE BEGINNING OF THE END.]\n\n\"You shall die to-morrow at sunrise.\"\n\n\"Alone?\" inquired Glenarvan, whose heart beat quickly.\n\n\"What! as if our Tohonga's life were not more precious than yours!\"\ncried Kai-Koumou, whose eyes expressed a fierce regret.\n\nAt this moment a commotion took place among the natives. Glenarvan cast\na rapid glance around him. The crowd opened, and a warrior, dripping\nwith sweat and overcome with fatigue, appeared.\n\nAs soon as Kai-Koumou perceived him, he said in English, evidently that\nhe might be understood by the captives:\n\n\"You come from the camp of the pale-faces?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the Maori.\n\n\"You saw the prisoner, our Tohonga?\"\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n\"Is he living?\"\n\n\"He is dead! The English have shot him.\"\n\nThe fate of Glenarvan and his companions was settled.\n\n\"You shall all die to-morrow at daybreak!\" cried Kai-Koumou.\n\nThe unfortunates were therefore to suffer a common death. Lady Helena\nand Mary Grant raised towards heaven a look of thankfulness.\n\nThe captives were not taken back to the temple. They were to attend\nthat day the funeral of the dead chief, and the bloody ceremonies\nconnected therewith. A party of natives conducted them to the foot of\nan enormous koudi, where these guardians remained without losing sight\nof their prisoners. The rest of the tribe, absorbed in their official\nmourning, seemed to have forgotten them.\n\nThe customary three days had elapsed since the death of Kara-Tété. The\nsoul of the deceased had therefore forever abandoned its mortal abode.\nThe sacred rites began.\n\nThe body was carried to a small mound in the centre of the\nfortification, clothed in splendid costume, and enveloped in a\nmagnificent flaxen mat. The head was adorned with plumes, and wore a\ncrown of green leaves. The face, arms, and breast had been rubbed with\noil, and therefore showed no mortification.\n\nThe parents and friends of the deceased came to the foot of the\nmound, and all at once, as if some director were beating time to a\nfuneral dirge, a great concert of cries, groans, and sobs arose on the\nair. They mourned the dead in plaintive and modulated cadences. His\nrelations struck their heads together; his kinswomen lacerated their\nfaces with their nails, and showed themselves more lavish of blood than\nof tears. These unfortunate females conscientiously fulfilled their\nbarbarous duty.\n\nBut these demonstrations were not enough to appease the soul of the\ndeceased, whose wrath would doubtless hav"}, {"chunk_id": 192, "text": "erful\ntribes of the Waikato with equal rank; and, during this interview,\nalthough Kai-Koumou smiled, his eyes betrayed a deep hostility.\n\nHe now questioned Glenarvan.\n\n\"You are English?\" said he.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Glenarvan, without hesitation, for this nationality\nwould probably facilitate an exchange.\n\n[Sidenote: THE RATE OF BARTER.]\n\n\"And your companions?\" asked Kai-Koumou.\n\n\"My companions are also English. We are shipwrecked travelers, and, if\nyou care to know, we have taken no part in the war.\"\n\n\"No matter,\" replied Kara-Tété, brutally. \"Every Englishman is our\nenemy.

Kai-Koumou seemed equally surprised.\n\n\"Then you doubt it?\" said he.\n\n\"I do not know,\" repeated Glenarvan.\n\n\"Will not your people accept you in exchange for our Tohonga?\"\n\n\"Not me alone,\" replied Glenarvan; \"but perhaps all of us.\"\n\n\"Among the Maoris,\" said Kai-Koumou, \"it is one for one.\"\n\n\"Offer these ladies first in exchange for your priest,\" answered\nGlenarvan, pointing to Lady Helena and Mary Grant. Lady Helena would\nhave rushed towards her husband, but the major restrained her.\n\n\"These two ladies,\" continued Glenarvan, turning respectfully towards\nthem, \"hold a high rank in their country.\"\n\nThe warrior glanced coldly at his prisoner. A malicious smile passed\nover his face; but he almost instantly repressed it, and replied, in a\nvoice which he could scarcely control:\n\n\"Do you hope, then, to deceive Kai-Koumou by false words, cursed\nEuropean? Do you think that Kai-Koumou's eyes cannot read your heart?\"\n\nThen, pointing to Lady Helena, he said:\n\n\"That is your wife!\"\n\n\"No, mine!\" cried Kara-Tété.\n\nThen, pushing back the prisoners, the chief laid his hand on Lady\nHelena's shoulder, who grew pale at the touch.\n\n\"Edward!\" cried the unfortunate woman, in terror.\n\nGlenarvan, without uttering a word, raised his arm. A report resounded.\nKara-Tété fell dead.\n\nAt this sound a crowd of natives issued from the huts. The pah was\nfilled in an instant. A hundred arms were raised against the captives.\nGlenarvan's revolver was snatched from his hand.\n\nKai-Koumou cast a strange look at Glenarvan, and then, guarding with\none hand the person of him who had fired, he controlled with the other\nthe throng that was rushing upon the Europeans.\n\n[Illustration: At last his voice rose above the tumult. \"Taboo! taboo!\"\ncried he.]\n\nAt last his voice rose above the tumult.\n\n\"Taboo! taboo!\" cried he.\n\nAt this word the crowd fell back before Glenarvan and his companions,\nthus temporarily preserved by a supernatural power.

Thus a new, a\nstronger, and more inexorable barrier was interposed to cut off the\nrealization of their hopes.\n\n“You see,” said the young man, with an air of sorrowful resignation, to\nFaria, “that God deems it right to take from me any claim to merit for\nwhat you call my devotion to you. I have promised to remain forever\nwith you, and now I could not break my promise if I would. The treasure\nwill be no more mine than yours, and neither of us will quit this\nprison. But my real treasure is not that, my dear friend, which awaits\nme beneath the sombre rocks of Monte Cristo, it is your presence, our\nliving together five or six hours a day, in spite of our jailers; it is\nthe rays of intelligence you have elicited from my brain, the languages\nyou have implanted in my memory, and which have taken root there with\nall their philological ramifications. These different sciences that you\nhave made so easy to me by the depth of the knowledge you possess of\nthem, and the clearness of the principles to which you have reduced\nthem—this is my treasure, my beloved friend, and with this you have\nmade me rich and happy. Believe me, and take comfort, this is better\nfor me than tons of gold and cases of diamonds, even were they not as\nproblematical as the clouds we see in the morning floating over the\nsea, which we take for _terra firma_, and which evaporate and vanish as\nwe draw near to them. To have you as long as possible near me, to hear\nyour eloquent speech,—which embellishes my mind, strengthens my soul,\nand makes my whole frame capable of great and terrible things, if I\nshould ever be free,—so fills my whole existence, that the despair to\nwhich I was just on the point of yielding when I knew you, has no\nlonger any hold over me; and this—this is my fortune—not chimerical,\nbut actual. I owe you my real good, my present happiness; and all the\nsovereigns of the earth, even Cæsar Borgia himself, could not deprive\nme of this.”\n\nThus, if not actually happy, yet the days these two unfortunates passed\ntogether went quickly. Faria, who for so long a time had kept silence\nas to the treasure, now perpetually talked of it. As he had prophesied\nwould be the case, he remained paralyzed in the right arm and the left\nleg, and had given up all hope of ever enjoying it himself. But he was\ncontinually thinking over some means of escape for his young companion,\nand anticipating the pleasure he would enjoy. For fear the letter might\nbe some day lost or stolen, he compelled Dantès to learn it by heart;\nand Dantès knew it from the first to the last word. Then he destroyed\nthe second portion, assured that if the first were seized, no one would\nbe able to discover its real meaning. Whole hours sometimes passed\nwhile Faria was giving instructions to Dantès,—instructions which were\nto serve him when he was at liberty. Then, once free, from the day and\nhour and moment when he was so, he could have but one only thought,\nwhich was, to gain Monte Cristo by some means, and remain there alone\nunder some pretext which would arouse no suspicions; and once there, to\nendeavor to find the wonderful caverns, and search in the appointed\nspot,—the appointed spot, be it remembered, being the farthest angle in\nthe second opening.\n\nIn the meanwhile the hours passed, if not rapidly, at least tolerably.\nFaria, as we have said, without having recovered the use of his hand\nand foot, had regained all the clearness of his understanding, and had\ngradually, besides the moral instructions we have detailed, taught his\nyouthful companion the patient and sublime duty of a prisoner, who\nlearns to make something from nothing. They were thus perpetually\nemployed,—Faria, that he might not see himself grow old; Dantès, for\nfear of recalling the almost extinct past which now only floated in his\nmemory like a distant light wandering in the night.

At\nthe end of three months he had learned to read. This was not enough—he\nmust now learn to write. The priest had a writing teacher at Rome make\nthree alphabets—one large, one middling, and one small; and pointed out\nto him that by the help of a sharp instrument he could trace the\nletters on a slate, and thus learn to write. The same evening, when the\nflock was safe at the farm, the little Luigi hastened to the smith at\nPalestrina, took a large nail, heated and sharpened it, and formed a\nsort of stylus. The next morning he gathered an armful of pieces of\nslate and began. At the end of three months he had learned to write.\nThe curate, astonished at his quickness and intelligence, made him a\npresent of pens, paper, and a penknife. This demanded new effort, but\nnothing compared to the first; at the end of a week he wrote as well\nwith this pen as with the stylus. The curate related the incident to\nthe Count of San-Felice, who sent for the little shepherd, made him\nread and write before him, ordered his attendant to let him eat with\nthe domestics, and to give him two piastres a month. With this, Luigi\npurchased books and pencils. He applied his imitative powers to\neverything, and, like Giotto, when young, he drew on his slate sheep,\nhouses, and trees. Then, with his knife, he began to carve all sorts of\nobjects in wood; it was thus that Pinelli, the famous sculptor, had\ncommenced.\n\n20105m\n\n\n\n“A girl of six or seven—that is, a little younger than Vampa—tended\nsheep on a farm near Palestrina; she was an orphan, born at Valmontone\nand was named Teresa. The two children met, sat down near each other,\nlet their flocks mingle together, played, laughed, and conversed\ntogether; in the evening they separated the Count of San-Felice’s flock\nfrom those of Baron Cervetri, and the children returned to their\nrespective farms, promising to meet the next morning. The next day they\nkept their word, and thus they grew up together. Vampa was twelve, and\nTeresa eleven. And yet their natural disposition revealed itself.\nBeside his taste for the fine arts, which Luigi had carried as far as\nhe could in his solitude, he was given to alternating fits of sadness\nand enthusiasm, was often angry and capricious, and always sarcastic.\nNone of the lads of Pampinara, Palestrina, or Valmontone had been able\nto gain any influence over him or even to become his companion. His\ndisposition (always inclined to exact concessions rather than to make\nthem) kept him aloof from all friendships. Teresa alone ruled by a\nlook, a word, a gesture, this impetuous character, which yielded\nbeneath the hand of a woman, and which beneath the hand of a man might\nhave broken, but could never have been bended. Teresa was lively and\ngay, but coquettish to excess. The two piastres that Luigi received\nevery month from the Count of San-Felice’s steward, and the price of\nall the little carvings in wood he sold at Rome, were expended in\near-rings, necklaces, and gold hairpins. So that, thanks to her\nfriend’s generosity, Teresa was the most beautiful and the best-attired\npeasant near Rome.\n\n“The two children grew up together, passing all their time with each\nother, and giving themselves up to the wild ideas of their different\ncharacters. Thus, in all their dreams, their wishes, and their\nconversations, Vampa saw himself the captain of a vessel, general of an\narmy, or governor of a province. Teresa saw herself rich, superbly\nattired, and attended by a train of liveried domestics. Then, when they\nhad thus passed the day in building castles in the air, they separated\ntheir flocks, and descended from the elevation of their dreams to the\nreality of their humble position.\n\n“One day the young shepherd told the count’s steward that he had seen a\nwolf come out of the Sabine mountains, and prowl ar"}, {"chunk_id": 103, "text": "orget, Cæsar, an indigestion declares\nitself immediately, while a prick or a bite occasions a delay of a day\nor two.’ Cæsar gave way before such cogent reasoning, and the cardinals\nwere consequently invited to dinner.\n\n“The table was laid in a vineyard belonging to the pope, near San\nPierdarena, a charming retreat which the cardinals knew very well by\nreport. Rospigliosi, quite set up with his new dignities, went with a\ngood appetite and his most ingratiating manner. Spada, a prudent man,\nand greatly attached to his only nephew, a young captain of the highest\npromise, took paper and pen, and made his will. He then sent word to\nhis nephew to wait for him near the vineyard; but it appeared the\nservant did not find him.\n\n“Spada knew what these invitations meant; since Christianity, so\neminently civilizing, had made progress in Rome, it was no longer a\ncenturion who came from the tyrant with a message, ‘Cæsar wills that\nyou die.’ but it was a legate _à latere_, who came with a smile on his\nlips to say from the pope, ‘His holiness requests you to dine with\nhim.’\n\n“Spada set out about two o’clock to San Pierdarena. The pope awaited\nhim. The first sight that attracted the eyes of Spada was that of his\nnephew, in full costume, and Cæsar Borgia paying him most marked\nattentions. Spada turned pale, as Cæsar looked at him with an ironical\nair, which proved that he had anticipated all, and that the snare was\nwell spread.\n\n“They began dinner and Spada was only able to inquire of his nephew if\nhe had received his message. The nephew replied no; perfectly\ncomprehending the meaning of the question. It was too late, for he had\nalready drunk a glass of excellent wine, placed for him expressly by\nthe pope’s butler. Spada at the same moment saw another bottle approach\nhim, which he was pressed to taste. An hour afterwards a physician\ndeclared they were both poisoned through eating mushrooms. Spada died\non the threshold of the vineyard; the nephew expired at his own door,\nmaking signs which his wife could not comprehend.\n\n“Then Cæsar and the pope hastened to lay hands on the heritage, under\npretense of seeking for the papers of the dead man. But the inheritance\nconsisted in this only, a scrap of paper on which Spada had written:—‘I\nbequeath to my beloved nephew my coffers, my books, and, amongst\nothers, my breviary with the gold corners, which I beg he will preserve\nin remembrance of his affectionate uncle.’\n\n“The heirs sought everywhere, admired the breviary, laid hands on the\nfurniture, and were greatly astonished that Spada, the rich man, was\nreally the most miserable of uncles—no treasures—unless they were those\nof science, contained in the library and laboratories. That was all.\nCæsar and his father searched, examined, scrutinized, but found\nnothing, or at least very little; not exceeding a few thousand crowns\nin plate, and about the same in ready money; but the nephew had time to\nsay to his wife before he expired: ‘Look well among my uncle’s papers;\nthere is a will.’\n\n“They sought even more thoroughly than the august heirs had done, but\nit was fruitless. There were two palaces and a vineyard behind the\nPalatine Hill; but in these days landed property had not much value,\nand the two palaces and the vineyard remained to the family since they\nwere beneath the rapacity of the pope and his son. Months and years\nrolled on. Alexander VI. died, poisoned,—you know by what mistake.\nCæsar, poisoned at the same time, escaped by shedding his skin like a\nsnake; but the new skin was spotted by the poison till it looked like a\ntiger’s. Then, compelled to quit Rome, he went and got himself\nobscurely killed in a night skirmish, scarcely noticed in history.\n\n“After the pope’s death and his son’s exile, it was supposed that the\nSpada family would resume the splendid position they had held before\nthe cardinal’s time; but this was not the case. The Spadas remained in\ndoubtful ease, a mystery hung over this dark affair, and the public\nrumor was, that Cæsar, a bett"}, {"chunk_id": 95, "text": "do you really believe I can acquire all\nthese things in so short a time?”\n\n“Not their application, certainly, but their principles you may; to\nlearn is not to know; there are the learners and the learned. Memory\nmakes the one, philosophy the other.”\n\n“But cannot one learn philosophy?”\n\n“Philosophy cannot be taught; it is the application of the sciences to\ntruth; it is like the golden cloud in which the Messiah went up into\nheaven.”\n\n“Well, then,” said Dantès, “What shall you teach me first? I am in a\nhurry to begin. I want to learn.”\n\n“Everything,” said the abbé. And that very evening the prisoners\nsketched a plan of education, to be entered upon the following day.\nDantès possessed a prodigious memory, combined with an astonishing\nquickness and readiness of conception; the mathematical turn of his\nmind rendered him apt at all kinds of calculation, while his naturally\npoetical feelings threw a light and pleasing veil over the dry reality\nof arithmetical computation, or the rigid severity of geometry. He\nalready knew Italian, and had also picked up a little of the Romaic\ndialect during voyages to the East; and by the aid of these two\nlanguages he easily comprehended the construction of all the others, so\nthat at the end of six months he began to speak Spanish, English, and\nGerman.\n\nIn strict accordance with the promise made to the abbé, Dantès spoke no\nmore of escape. Perhaps the delight his studies afforded him left no\nroom for such thoughts; perhaps the recollection that he had pledged\nhis word (on which his sense of honor was keen) kept him from referring\nin any way to the possibilities of flight. Days, even months, passed by\nunheeded in one rapid and instructive course. At the end of a year\nDantès was a new man. Dantès observed, however, that Faria, in spite of\nthe relief his society afforded, daily grew sadder; one thought seemed\nincessantly to harass and distract his mind. Sometimes he would fall\ninto long reveries, sigh heavily and involuntarily, then suddenly rise,\nand, with folded arms, begin pacing the confined space of his dungeon.\nOne day he stopped all at once, and exclaimed:\n\n“Ah, if there were no sentinel!”\n\n“There shall not be one a minute longer than you please,” said Dantès,\nwho had followed the working of his thoughts as accurately as though\nhis brain were enclosed in crystal so clear as to display its minutest\noperations.\n\n“I have already told you,” answered the abbé, “that I loathe the idea\nof shedding blood.”\n\n“And yet the murder, if you choose to call it so, would be simply a\nmeasure of self-preservation.”\n\n“No matter! I could never agree to it.”\n\n“Still, you have thought of it?”\n\n“Incessantly, alas!” cried the abbé.\n\n“And you have discovered a means of regaining our freedom, have you\nnot?” asked Dantès eagerly.\n\n“I have; if it were only possible to place a deaf and blind sentinel in\nthe gallery beyond us.”\n\n“He shall be both blind and deaf,” replied the young man, with an air\nof determination that made his companion shudder.\n\n“No, no,” cried the abbé; “impossible!”\n\nDantès endeavored to renew the subject; the abbé shook his head in\ntoken of disapproval, and refused to make any further response. Three\nmonths passed away.\n\n“Are you strong?” the abbé asked one day of Dantès. The young man, in\nreply, took up the chisel, bent it into the form of a horseshoe, and\nthen as readily straightened it.\n\n“And will you engage not to do any harm to the sentry, except as a last\nresort?”\n\n“I promise on my honor.”\n\n“Then,” said the abbé, “we may hope to put our design into execution.”\n\n“And how long shall we be in accomplishing the necessary work?”\n\n“At least a year.”\n\n“And shall we begin at once?”\n\n“At once.”\n\n“We have lost a year to no purpose!” cried Dantès.\n\n“Do you consider the last twelve months to have been wasted?” asked the\nabbé.\n\n“Forgive me!” cried Edmond, blushing deeply.\n\n“Tut, tut!” answered the abbé, “man is but man after all, and you are\nabout the best specimen of the genus I have ever known.

Valentine instantly ran\ndown. The doctor was a friend of the family, and at the same time one\nof the cleverest men of the day, and very fond of Valentine, whose\nbirth he had witnessed.

It must have been delirium;\nshe fancies, too, that she saw a phantom enter her chamber and even\nheard the noise it made on touching her glass.”\n\n“It is singular,” said the doctor; “I was not aware that Madame de\nSaint-Méran was subject to such hallucinations.”\n\n“It is the first time I ever saw her in this condition,” said\nValentine; “and this morning she frightened me so that I thought her\nmad; and my father, who you know is a strong-minded man, himself\nappeared deeply impressed.”\n\n“We will go and see,” said the doctor; “what you tell me seems very\nstrange.” The notary here descended, and Valentine was informed that\nher grandmother was alone.\n\n“Go upstairs,” she said to the doctor.\n\n“And you?”\n\n“Oh, I dare not—she forbade my sending for you; and, as you say, I am\nmyself agitated, feverish and out of sorts. I will go and take a turn\nin the garden to recover myself.”\n\nThe doctor pressed Valentine’s hand, and while he visited her\ngrandmother, she descended the steps. We need not say which portion of\nthe garden was her favorite walk. After remaining for a short time in\nthe parterre surrounding the house, and gathering a rose to place in\nher waist or hair, she turned into the dark avenue which led to the\nbench; then from the bench she went to the gate. As usual, Valentine\nstrolled for a short time among her flowers, but without gathering\nthem. The mourning in her heart forbade her assuming this simple\nornament, though she had not yet had time to put on the outward\nsemblance of woe.\n\n30327m\n\n\n\nShe then"}]}

He reflected, smiled, and replied to me by\na Sicilian proverb, which I believe is also a French proverb, ‘My son,\nthe world was not made in a day—but in seven. Return on Sunday.’ On the\nSunday following I did return to him. Instead of having watered his\ncabbage with arsenic, he had watered it this time with a solution of\nsalts, having their basis in strychnine, _strychnos colubrina_, as the\nlearned term it. Now, the cabbage had not the slightest appearance of\ndisease in the world, and the rabbit had not the smallest distrust;\nyet, five minutes afterwards, the rabbit was dead. The fowl pecked at\nthe rabbit, and the next day was a dead hen. This time we were the\nvultures; so we opened the bird, and this time all special symptoms had\ndisappeared, there were only general symptoms. There was no peculiar\nindication in any organ—an excitement of the nervous system—that was\nit; a case of cerebral congestion—nothing more. The fowl had not been\npoisoned—she had died of apoplexy. Apoplexy is a rare disease among\nfowls, I believe, but very common among men.”\n\nMadame de Villefort appeared more and more thoughtful.\n\n“It is very fortunate,” she observed, “that such substances could only\nbe prepared by chemists; otherwise, all the world would be poisoning\neach other.”\n\n“By chemists and persons who have a taste for chemistry,” said Monte\nCristo carelessly.\n\n“And then,” said Madame de Villefort, endeavoring by a struggle, and\nwith effort, to get away from her thoughts, “however skilfully it is\nprepared, crime is always crime, and if it avoid human scrutiny, it\ndoes not escape the eye of God. The Orientals are stronger than we are\nin cases of conscience, and, very prudently, have no hell—that is the\npoint.”\n\n30075m\n\n\n\n“Really, madame, this is a scruple which naturally must occur to a pure\nmind like yours, but which would easily yield before sound reasoning.\nThe bad side of human thought will always be defined by the paradox of\nJean Jacques Rousseau,—you remember,—the mandarin who is killed five\nhundred leagues off by raising the tip of the finger. Man’s whole life\npasses in doing these things, and his intellect is exhausted by\nreflecting on them. You will find very few persons who will go and\nbrutally thrust a knife in the heart of a fellow-creature, or will\nadminister to him, in order to remove him from the surface of the globe\non which we move with life and animation, that quantity of arsenic of\nwhich we just now talked. Such a thing is really out of rule—eccentric\nor stupid. To attain such a point, the blood must be heated to\nthirty-six degrees, the pulse be, at least, at ninety, and the feelings\nexcited beyond the ordinary limit. But suppose one pass, as is\npermissible in philology, from the word itself to its softened synonym,\nthen, instead of committing an ignoble assassination you make an\n‘elimination;’ you merely and simply remove from your path the\nindividual who is in your way, and that without shock or violence,\nwithout the display of the sufferings which, in the case of becoming a\npunishment, make a martyr of the victim, and a butcher, in every sense\nof the word, of him who inflicts them. Then there will be no blood, no\ngroans, no convulsions, and above all, no consciousness of that horrid\nand compromising moment of accomplishing the act,—then one escapes the\nclutch of the human law, which says, ‘Do not disturb society!’ This is\nthe mode in which they manage these things, and succeed in Eastern\nclimes, where there are grave and phlegmatic persons who car"}, {"chunk_id": 101, "text": " to belong to him alo...\n\nheir.\n\n                    “25th April, 149’”\n\n\n“Well!” said Faria, when the young man had finished reading it.\n\n“Why,” replied Dantès, “I see nothing but broken lines and unconnected\nwords, which are rendered illegible by fire.”\n\n“Yes, to you, my friend, who read them for the first time; but not for\nme, who have grown pale over them by many nights’ study, and have\nreconstructed every phrase, completed every thought.”\n\n“And do you believe you have discovered the hidden meaning?”\n\n“I am sure I have, and you shall judge for yourself; but first listen\nto the history of this paper.”\n\n“Silence!” exclaimed Dantès. “Steps approach—I go—adieu!”\n\nAnd Dantès, happy to escape the history and explanation which would be\nsure to confirm his belief in his friend’s mental instability, glided\nlike a snake along the narrow passage; while Faria, restored by his\nalarm to a certain amount of activity, pushed the stone into place with\nhis foot, and covered it with a mat in order the more effectually to\navoid discovery.\n\nIt was the governor, who, hearing of Faria’s illness from the jailer,\nhad come in person to see him.\n\nFaria sat up to receive him, avoiding all gestures in order that he\nmight conceal from the governor the paralysis that had already half\nstricken him with death. His fear was lest the governor, touched with\npity, might order him to be removed to better quarters, and thus\nseparate him from his young companion. But fortunately this was not the\ncase, and the governor left him, convinced that the poor madman, for\nwhom in his heart he felt a kind of affection, was only troubled with a\nslight indisposition.\n\nDuring this time, Edmond, seated on his bed with his head in his hands,\ntried to collect his scattered thoughts. Faria, since their first\nacquaintance, had been on all points so rational and logical, so\nwonderfully sagacious, in fact, that he could not understand how so\nmuch wisdom on all points could be allied with madness. Was Faria\ndeceived as to his treasure, or was all the world deceived as to Faria?\n\nDantès remained in his cell all day, not daring to return to his\nfriend, thinking thus to defer the moment when he should be convinced,\nonce for all, that the abbé was mad—such a conviction would be so\nterrible!\n\nBut, towards the evening after the hour for the customary visit had\ngone by, Faria, not seeing the young man appear, tried to move and get\nover the distance which separated them. Edmond shuddered when he heard\nthe painful efforts which the old man made to drag himself along; his\nleg was inert, and he could no longer make use of one arm. Edmond was\nobliged to assist him, for otherwise he would not have been able to\nenter by the small aperture which led to Dantès’ chamber.\n\n“Here I am, pursuing you remorselessly,” he said with a benignant\nsmile. “You thought to escape my munificence, but it is in vain. Listen\nto me.”\n\nEdmond saw there was no escape, and placing the old man on his bed, he\nseated himself on the stool beside him.\n\n“You know,” said the abbé, “that I was the secretary and intimate\nfriend of Cardinal Spada, the last of the princes of that name. I owe\nto this worthy lord all the happiness I ever knew. He was not rich,\nalthough the wealth of his family had passed into a proverb, and I\nheard the phrase very often, ‘As rich as a Spada.’ But he, like public\nrumor, lived on this reputation for wealth; his palace was my paradise.\nI was tutor to his nephews, who are dead; and when he was alone in the\nworld, I tried by absolute devotion to his will, to make up to him all\nhe had done for me during ten years of unremitting kindness. The\ncardinal’s house had no secrets for me. I had often seen my noble\npatron annotating ancient volumes, and eagerly searching amongst dusty\nfamily manuscripts. One day when I was reproaching him for his\nunavailing searches, and deploring the prostration of mind that\nfollowed them, he looked at me, and, smiling bitterly, opened a volume\nrelating to the History of the City "}, {"chunk_id": 473, "text": "\ntalent are they celebrated? You know there are different sorts.”\n\n“That tall, harsh-looking man is very learned, he discovered, in the\nneighborhood of Rome, a kind of lizard with a vertebra more than\nlizards usually have, and he immediately laid his discovery before the\nInstitute. The thing was discussed for a long time, but finally decided\nin his favor. I can assure you the vertebra made a great noise in the\nlearned world, and the gentleman, who was only a knight of the Legion\nof Honor, was made an officer.”\n\n“Come,” said Monte Cristo, “this cross seems to me to be wisely\nawarded. I suppose, had he found another additional vertebra, they\nwould have made him a commander.”\n\n“Very likely,” said Albert.\n\n“And who can that person be who has taken it into his head to wrap\nhimself up in a blue coat embroidered with green?”\n\n“Oh, that coat is not his own idea; it is the Republic’s, which deputed\nDavid12 to devise a uniform for the Academicians.”\n\n“Indeed?” said Monte Cristo; “so this gentleman is an Academician?”\n\n“Within the last week he has been made one of the learned assembly.”\n\n“And what is his especial talent?”\n\n“His talent? I believe he thrusts pins through the heads of rabbits, he\nmakes fowls eat madder, and punches the spinal marrow out of dogs with\nwhalebone.”\n\n“And he is made a member of the Academy of Sciences for this?”\n\n“No; of the French Academy.”\n\n“But what has the French Academy to do with all this?”\n\n“I was going to tell you. It seems——”\n\n“That his experiments have very considerably advanced the cause of\nscience, doubtless?”\n\n“No; that his style of writing is very good.”\n\n“This must be very flattering to the feelings of the rabbits into whose\nheads he has thrust pins, to the fowls whose bones he has dyed red, and\nto the dogs whose spinal marrow he has punched out?”\n\nAlbert laughed.\n\n“And the other one?” demanded the count.\n\n“That one?”\n\n“Yes, the third.”\n\n“The one in the dark blue coat?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“He is a colleague of the count, and one of the most active opponents\nto the idea of providing the Chamber of Peers with a uniform. He was\nvery successful upon that question. He stood badly with the Liberal\npapers, but his noble opposition to the wishes of the court is now\ngetting him into favor with the journalists. They talk of making him an\nambassador.”\n\n30303m\n\n\n\n“And what are his claims to the peerage?”\n\n“He has composed two or three comic operas, written four or five\narticles in the _Siècle_, and voted five or six years on the\nministerial side.”\n\n“Bravo, viscount,” said Monte Cristo, smiling; “you are a delightful\n_cicerone_. And now you will do me a favor, will you not?”\n\n“What is it?”\n\n“Do not introduce me to any of these gentlemen; and should they wish\nit, you will warn me.” Just then the count felt his arm pressed. He\nturned round; it was Danglars.\n\n“Ah! is it you, baron?” said he.\n\n“Why do you call me baron?” said Danglars; “you know that I care\nnothing for my title. I am not like you, viscount; you like your title,\ndo you not?”\n\n“Certainly,” replied Albert, “seeing that without my title I should be\nnothing; while you, sacrificing the baron, would still remain the\nmillionaire.”\n\n“Which seems to me the finest title under the royalty of July,” replied\nDanglars.\n\n“Unfortunately,” said Monte Cristo, “one’s title to a millionaire does\nnot last for life, like that of baron, peer of France, or academician;\nfor example, the millionaires Franck & Poulmann, of Frankfurt, who have\njust become bankrupts.”\n\n“Indeed?” said Danglars, becoming pale.\n\n“Yes; I received the news this evening by a courier. I had about a\nmillion in their hands, but, warned in time, I withdrew it a month\nago.”\n\n“Ah, _mon Dieu!_” exclaimed Danglars, “they have drawn on me for\n200,000 francs!”\n\n“Well, you can throw out the draft; their signature is worth five per\ncent.”\n\n“Yes, but it is too late,” said Danglars, “I have honored their bills.”\n\n“Then,” said Monte Cristo, “here are 200,000 francs gone after——”\n\n“Hush, do not mention these things,” said Da"}, {"chunk_id": 365, "text": " what you inquire of me, is not the result of a chance\nquery, for two years ago you asked me the same questions, and said\nthen, that for a very long time this history of Mithridates had\noccupied your mind.”\n\n“True, sir. The two favorite studies of my youth were botany and\nmineralogy, and subsequently, when I learned that the use of simples\nfrequently explained the whole history of a people, and the entire life\nof individuals in the East, as flowers betoken and symbolize a love\naffair, I have regretted that I was not a man, that I might have been a\nFlamel, a Fontana, or a Cabanis.”\n\n“And the more, madame,” said Monte Cristo, “as the Orientals do not\nconfine themselves, as did Mithridates, to make a cuirass of his\npoisons, but they also made them a dagger. Science becomes, in their\nhands, not only a defensive weapon, but still more frequently an\noffensive one; the one serves against all their physical sufferings,\nthe other against all their enemies. With opium, belladonna, brucea,\nsnake-wood, and the cherry-laurel, they put to sleep all who stand in\ntheir way. There is not one of those women, Egyptian, Turkish, or\nGreek, whom here you call ‘good women,’ who do not know how, by means\nof chemistry, to stupefy a doctor, and in psychology to amaze a\nconfessor.”\n\n“Really,” said Madame de Villefort, whose eyes sparkled with strange\nfire at this conversation.\n\n“Oh, yes, indeed, madame,” continued Monte Cristo, “the secret dramas\nof the East begin with a love philtre and end with a death potion—begin\nwith paradise and end with—hell. There are as many elixirs of every\nkind as there are caprices and peculiarities in the physical and moral\nnature of humanity; and I will say further—the art of these chemists is\ncapable with the utmost precision to accommodate and proportion the\nremedy and the bane to yearnings for love or desires for vengeance.”\n\n“But, sir,” remarked the young woman, “these Eastern societies, in the\nmidst of which you have passed a portion of your existence, are as\nfantastic as the tales that come from their strange land. A man can\neasily be put out of the way there, then; it is, indeed, the Bagdad and\nBassora of the _Thousand and One Nights_. The sultans and viziers who\nrule over society there, and who constitute what in France we call the\ngovernment, are really Haroun-al-Raschids and Giaffars, who not only\npardon a poisoner, but even make him a prime minister, if his crime has\nbeen an ingenious one, and who, under such circumstances, have the\nwhole story written in letters of gold, to divert their hours of\nidleness and _ennui_.”\n\n“By no means, madame; the fanciful exists no longer in the East. There,\ndisguised under other names, and concealed under other costumes, are\npolice agents, magistrates, attorneys-general, and bailiffs. They hang,\nbehead, and impale their criminals in the most agreeable possible\nmanner; but some of these, like clever rogues, have contrived to escape\nhuman justice, and succeed in their fraudulent enterprises by cunning\nstratagems. Amongst us a simpleton, possessed by the demon of hate or\ncupidity, who has an enemy to destroy, or some near relation to dispose\nof, goes straight to the grocer’s or druggist’s, gives a false name,\nwhich leads more easily to his detection than his real one, and under\nthe pretext that the rats prevent him from sleeping, purchases five or\nsix grammes of arsenic—if he is really a cunning fellow, he goes to\nfive or six different druggists or grocers, and thereby becomes only\nfive or six times more easily traced;—then, when he has acquired his\nspecific, he administers duly to his enemy, or near kinsman, a dose of\narsenic which would make a mammoth or mastodon burst, and which,\nwithout rhyme or reason, makes his victim utter groans which alarm the\nentire neighborhood.

The same evening the grocer or grocers, druggist or\ndruggists, come and say, ‘It was I who sold the arsenic to the\ngentleman;’ and rather than not recognize the guilty purchaser, they\nwill recognize twenty. Then the foolish criminal is taken, imprisoned,\ninterrogated, confronted, confounded, condemned, and cut off by hemp or\nsteel; or if she be a woman of any consideration, they lock her up for\nlife. This is the way in which you Northerns understand chemistry,\nmadame. Desrues was, however, I must confess, more skilful.”\n\n“What would you have, sir?” said the lady, laughing; “we do what we\ncan. All the world has not the secret of the Medicis or the Borgias.”\n\n“Now,” replied the count, shrugging his shoulders, “shall I tell you\nthe cause of all these stupidities? It is because, at your theatres, by\nwhat at least I could judge by reading the pieces they play, they see\npersons swallow the contents of a phial, or suck the button of a ring,\nand fall dead instantly. Five minutes afterwards the curtain falls, and\nthe spectators depart. They are ignorant of the consequences of the\nmurder; they see neither the police commissary with his badge of\noffice, nor the corporal with his four men; and so the poor fools\nbelieve that the whole thing is as easy as lying. But go a little way\nfrom France—go either to Aleppo or Cairo, or only to Naples or Rome,\nand you will see people passing by you in the streets—people erect,\nsmiling, and fresh-colored, of whom Asmodeus, if you were holding on by\nthe skirt of his mantle, would say, ‘That man was poisoned three weeks\nago; he will be a dead man in a month.’”\n\n“Then,” remarked Madame de Villefort, “they have again discovered the\nsecret of the famous _aqua Tofana_ that they said was lost at Perugia.”\n\n“Ah, but madame, does mankind ever lose anything? The arts change about\nand make a tour of the world; things take a different name, and the\nvulgar do not follow them—that is all; but there is always the same\nresult. Poisons act particularly on some organ or another—one on the\nstomach, another on the brain, another on the intestines. Well, the\npoison brings on a cough, the cough an inflammation of the lungs, or\nsome other complaint catalogued in the book of science, which, however,\nby no means precludes it from being decidedly mortal; and if it were\nnot, would be sure to become so, thanks to the remedies applied by\nfoolish doctors, who are generally bad chemists, and which will act in\nfavor of or against the malady, as you please; and then there is a\nhuman being killed according to all the rules of art and skill, and of\nwhom justice learns nothing, as was said by a terrible chemist of my\nacquaintance, the worthy Abbé Adelmonte of Taormina, in Sicily, who has\nstudied these national phenomena very profoundly.”\n\n“It is quite frightful, but deeply interesting,” said the young lady,\nmotionless with attention. “I thought, I must confess, that these\ntales, were inventions of the Middle Ages.”\n\n“Yes, no doubt, but improved upon by ours. What is the use of time,\nrewards of merit, medals, crosses, Monthyon prizes, if they do not lead\nsociety towards more complete perfection? Yet man will never be perfect\nuntil he learns to create and destroy; he does know how to destroy, and\nthat is half the battle.”\n\n“So,” added Madame de Villefort, constantly returning to her object,\n“the poisons of the Borgias, the Medicis, the Renées, the Ruggieris,\nand later, probably, that of Baron de "}]}

What,\nmoreover, could ten defenceless men do against thirty well-armed\nsavages? Besides, Glenarvan thought it likely that Kai-Koumou's tribe\nhad lost some chief of high rank whom they were particularly anxious to\nrecover; and he was not mistaken.\n\nThe next day the canoe ascended the river with increased swiftness.\nIt stopped for a moment at the junction of a small river which wound\nacross the plains on the right bank. Here another canoe, with ten\nnatives on board, joined Kai-Koumou. The warriors merely exchanged\nsalutations, and then continued their course. The new-comers had\nrecently fought against the English troops, as could be seen by their\ntattered garments, their gory weapons, and the wounds that still bled\nbeneath their rags. They were gloomy and taciturn, and, with the\nindifference common to all savage races, paid no attention to the\ncaptives.\n\nTowards evening Kai-Koumou landed at the foot of the mountains,\nwhose nearer ridges reached precipitously to the river-bank. Here\ntwenty natives, who had disembarked from their canoes, were making\npreparations for the night. Fires blazed beneath the trees. A chief,\nequal in rank to Kai-Koumou, advanced with measured pace, and, rubbing\nhis nose against that of the latter, saluted him cordially. The\nprisoners were stationed in the centre of the encampment, and guarded\nwith extreme vigilance.\n\nThe next morning the ascent of the Waikato was resumed. Other boats\ncame from various affluents of the river. Sixty warriors, evidently\nfugitives from the last insurrection, had now assembled, and were\nreturning, more or less wounded in the fray, to the mountain districts.\nSometimes a song arose from the canoes, as they advanced in single\nfile. One native struck up the patriotic ode of the mysterious \"Pihé,\"\nthe national hymn that calls the Maoris to battle. The full and\nsonorous voice of the singer waked the echoes of the mountains; and\nafter each stanza his comrades struck their breasts, and sang the\nwarlike verses in chorus. Then they seized their oars again, and the\ncanoes were headed up stream.\n\nDuring the day a singular sight enlivened the voyage. About four\no'clock the canoe, without lessening its speed, guided by the steady\nhand of the chief, dashed through a narrow gorge. Eddies broke\nviolently against numerous small islands, which rendered navigation\nexceeding dangerous. Never could it be more hazardous to capsize, for\nthe banks afforded no refuge, and whoever had set foot on the porous\ncrust of the shore would probably have perished. At this point the\nriver flowed between warm springs, oxide of iron colored the muddy\nground a brilliant red, and not a yard of firm earth could be seen.\nThe air was heavy with a penetrating sulphureous odor. The natives did\nnot regard it, but the captives were seriously annoyed by the noxious\nvapors exhaled from the fissures of the soil and the bubbles that\nburst and discharged their gaseous contents. Yet, however disagreeable\nthese emanations were, the eye could not but admire this magnificent\nspectacle.\n\n[Illustration: At this point the river flowed between warm springs, and\nnot a yard of firm earth could be seen.]\n\nThe canoes soon after entered a dense cloud of white smoke, whose\nwreaths rose in gradually decreasing circles above the river. On the\nshores a hundred geysers, some shooting forth masses of vapor, and\nothers overflowing in liquid columns, varied their effects, like the\njets and cascades of a fountain. It seemed as though some engineer was\ndirecting at his pleasure the outflowings of these springs, as the\nwaters and vapor, mingling in the air, formed rainbows in the sunbeams.\n\nFor two miles the canoes glided within this vapory atmosphere,\nenveloped in its warm waves that rolled along the surface of the water.\nThen the sulphureous smoke disappeared, and a pure swift current of\nfresh air refreshed the panting voyagers. The region of the springs was\npassed. Before the cl"}, {"chunk_id": 193, "text": "\"\ncried he.]\n\nAt last his voice rose above the tumult.\n\n\"Taboo! taboo!\" cried he.\n\nAt this word the crowd fell back before Glenarvan and his companions,\nthus temporarily preserved by a supernatural power. A few moments after\nthey were led back to the temple that served as their prison; but\nRobert Grant and Paganel were no longer with them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER L.\n\nTHE CHIEF'S FUNERAL.\n\n\nKai-Koumou, according to a custom quite ordinary in New Zealand, joined\nthe rank of priest to that of chief, and could, therefore, extend to\npersons or objects the superstitious protection of the taboo.\n\nThe taboo, which is common to the tribes of Polynesia, has the power\nto prohibit at once all connection with the object or person tabooed.\nAccording to the Maori religion, whoever should lay his sacrilegious\nhand on what is declared taboo would be punished with death by the\noffended god; and in case the divinity should delay to avenge his own\ninsult, the priests would not fail to excite his anger.\n\nAs for the prisoners confined in the temple, the taboo had rescued\nthem from the fury of the tribe. Some of the natives, the friends and\npartisans of Kai-Koumou, had stopped suddenly at the command of their\nchief, and had protected the captives.\n\n[Sidenote: THE TORTURES OF SUSPENSE.]\n\nGlenarvan, however, was not blind to the fate that was reserved for\nhim. Only his death could atone for the murder of a chief. Among savage\nraces death is always preceded by a protracted torture. He therefore\nexpected to cruelly expiate the righteous indignation that had nerved\nhis arm, but hoped that Kai-Koumou's rage would fall only on himself.\n\nWhat a night he and his companions passed! Who could depict their\nanguish, or measure their sufferings? Neither poor Robert nor brave\nPaganel had reappeared. But how could they doubt their fate? Were they\nnot the first victims of the natives' vengeance? All hope had vanished\neven from the heart of the major, who did not easily despair. John\nMangles felt himself growing mad at sight of the sad dejection of Mary\nGrant, thus separated from her brother. Glenarvan thought of that\nterrible request of Lady Helena, who, rather than yield to torture or\nslavery, preferred to die by his hand. Could he summon this fearful\ncourage? As for an escape, that was plainly impossible. Ten warriors,\narmed to the teeth, guarded the entrance of the temple.\n\nMorning came at last. There had been no communication between the\nnatives and the prisoners. The hut contained a considerable quantity\nof food, which the unfortunates scarcely touched. Hunger gave place to\ngrief. The day passed without bringing a change or a hope. Doubtless\nthe hour for the dead chief's funeral and their torture would be the\nsame.\n\nHowever, although Glenarvan concluded that Kai-Koumou must have\nabandoned all idea of exchange, the major on this point retained a\ngleam of hope.\n\n\"Who knows,\" said he, reminding Glenarvan of the effect produced upon\nthe chief by the death of Kara-Tété,--\"who knows but that Kai-Koumou in\nreality feels obliged to you?\"\n\nBut, in spite of these observations, Glenarvan would no longer hope.\nThe next day also passed away without the preparations for torture\nbeing made. The reason of the delay was this.\n\nThe Maoris believe that the soul, for three days after death, inhabits\nthe body of the deceased, and therefore during this time the corpse\nremains unburied. This custom was rigorously observed, and for two days\nthe pah was deserted. Captain Mangles frequently stood on Wilson's\nshoulders and surveyed the fortification. No native was seen; only the\nsentinels guarded in turn at the door of their prison.\n\nBut on the third day the huts were opened. The savages, men, women,\nand children, to the number of several hundreds, assembled in the pah,\nsilent and calm. Kai-Koumou came out of his house, and, surrounded by\nthe principal warriors of his tribe, took his place on a mound several\nfeet high in the centre of the fortification. The crowd of natives\nformed a semicircle aroun"}, {"chunk_id": 190, "text": "des,\nfifteen feet high. A second line of stakes, and then a fence of osiers,\npierced with loop-holes, inclosed the inner space, the court-yard of\nthe pah, in which stood several Maori tents, and forty huts which were\nsymmetrically arranged.\n\nOn their arrival, the captives were terribly impressed at sight of\nthe heads that ornamented the stakes of the second inclosure. Lady\nHelena and Mary Grant turned away their eyes with more of disgust than\nterror. These heads had most of them belonged to hostile chiefs, fallen\nin battle, whose bodies had served as food for the conquerors. The\ngeographer knew them to be such by their hollow and eyeless sockets!\n\nIn Kai-Koumou's pah only the heads of his enemies formed this frightful\nmuseum; and here, doubtless, more than one English skull had served to\nincrease the size of the chief's collection.\n\nHis hut, among those belonging to warriors of lower rank, stood at the\nrear of the pah, in front of a large open terrace. This structure was\nbuilt of stakes, interlaced with branches, and lined inside with flax\nmatting.\n\nOnly one opening gave access to the dwelling. A thick curtain, made\nof a vegetable tissue, served as a door. The roof projected so as to\nform a water-shed. Several faces, carved at the ends of the rafters,\nadorned the hut, and the curtain was covered with various imitations\nof foliage, symbolical figures, monsters, and graceful sculpturing,\na curious piece of work, fashioned by the scissors of the native\ndecorators.\n\n[Sidenote: FEMININE ORATORY.]\n\nInside of the habitation the floor was made of hard-trodden earth,\nand raised six inches above the ground. Several rush screens and some\nmattresses, covered with woven matting of long leaves and twigs,\nserved as beds. In the middle of the room a hole in a stone formed the\nfireplace, and another in the roof answered for a chimney.\n\nThe smoke, when it became sufficiently thick, perforce escaped at this\noutlet, but it of course blackened the walls of the house.\n\nOn one side of the hut were storehouses, containing the chief's\nprovisions, his harvest of flax, potatoes, and edible ferns, and\nthe ovens where the various articles of food were cooked by contact\nwith heated stones. Farther off, in small pens, pigs and goats were\nconfined, and dogs ran about seeking their scanty sustenance. They were\nrather poorly kept, for animals that formed the Maori daily food.\n\nGlenarvan and his companions had taken in the whole at a glance. They\nawaited beside an empty hut the good pleasure of the chief, exposed to\nthe insults of a crowd of old women, who surrounded them like harpies,\nand threatened them with their fists, crying and howling. Several\nEnglish words that passed their lips clearly indicated that they were\ndemanding immediate vengeance.\n\nIn the midst of these cries and threats, Lady Helena affected a\ncalmness that she could not feel in her heart. This courageous woman,\nin order that her husband's coolness might not forsake him, heroically\ncontrolled her emotions. Poor Mary Grant felt herself growing weak, and\nCaptain Mangles supported her, ready to die in her defence. The others\nendured this torrent of invectives in various ways, either indifferent\nlike the major, or increasingly annoyed like Paganel.\n\nGlenarvan, wishing to relieve Lady Helena from the assaults of these\nshrews, boldly approached Kai-Koumou, and, pointing to the hideous\nthrong, said:\n\n\"Drive them away!\"\n\nThe Maori chief gazed steadily at his prisoner without replying. Then\nwith a gesture he silenced the noisy horde. Glenarvan bowed in token of\nthanks, and slowly resumed his place among his friends.\n\nKai-Koumou, fearing an insurrection of the fanatics of his tribe, now\nled his captives to a sacred place, situated at the other end of the\npah, on the edge of a precipice. This hut rested against a rock that\nrose a hundred feet above it and was a steep boundary to this side of\nthe fortification. In this consecrated temple the priests, or \"arikis,\"\ninstruct the New Zealanders. The buildin"}, {"chunk_id": 202, "text": "d in on all sides.\n\n\"Let us go down,\" cried he, \"before our only way of escape is blocked\nup.\"\n\nBut just as the ladies rose by a final effort, MacNabb stopped them,\nand said:\n\n\"It is useless, Glenarvan. Look!\"\n\nAnd all saw, indeed, that an inexplicable change had taken place in the\nmovements of the Maoris. Their pursuit had been suddenly interrupted.\nTheir ascent of the mountain had ceased, as if by an imperious\ninterdict. The crowd of natives had checked their swiftness, and\nhalted, like the waves of the sea before an impassable rock.\n\nAll the savages, thirsting for blood, were now ranged along the foot\nof the mountain, yelling, gesticulating, and brandishing guns and\nhatchets; but they did not advance a single foot. Their dogs, like\nthemselves, as though chained to earth, howled with rage.\n\nWhat was the difficulty? What invisible power restrained the natives?\nThe fugitives gazed without comprehending, fearing that the charm that\nenchained Kai-Koumou's tribe would dissolve.\n\nSuddenly Captain Mangles uttered a cry that caused his companions to\nturn. He pointed to a little fortress at the summit of the peak.\n\n\"The tomb of the chief Kara-Tété!\" cried Robert.\n\n\"Are you in earnest?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"Yes, my lord, it is the tomb; I recognize it.\"\n\nRobert was right. Fifty feet above, at the extreme point of the\nmountain, stood a small palisaded inclosure of freshly-painted stakes.\nGlenarvan, likewise, recognized the sepulchre of the Maori chief. In\ntheir wanderings they had come to the top of the Maunganamu, where\nKara-Tété had been buried.\n\nFollowed by his companions, he climbed the sides of the peak, to the\nvery foot of the tomb. A large opening, covered with mats, formed the\nentrance. Glenarvan was about to enter, when, all at once, he started\nback suddenly.\n\n\"A savage!\" said he.\n\n\"A savage in this tomb?\" inquired the major.\n\n\"Yes, MacNabb.\"\n\n\"What matter? Let us enter.\"\n\nGlenarvan, the major, Robert, and Captain Mangles passed into the\ninclosure. A Maori was there, clad in a great flax mantle. The darkness\nof the sepulchre did not permit them to distinguish his features. He\nappeared very calm, and was eating his breakfast with the most perfect\nindifference.\n\nGlenarvan was about to address him, when the native, anticipating him,\nsaid, in an amiable tone, and in excellent English:\n\n\"Be seated, my dear lord; breakfast is awaiting you.\"\n\nIt was Paganel. At his voice all rushed into the tomb, and gazed with\nwonder at the worthy geographer. Paganel was found! The common safety\nwas represented in him. They were going to question him: they wished\nto know how and why he was on the top of the mountain; but Glenarvan\nchecked this unseasonable curiosity.\n\n[Illustration: \"Be seated, my dear lord; breakfast is awaiting you.\"]\n\n\"The savages!\" said he.\n\n\"The savages,\" replied Paganel, shrugging his shoulders, \"are\nindividuals whom I supremely despise.\"\n\n\"But can they not----?\"\n\n\"They! the imbeciles! Come and see them.\"\n\nEach followed Paganel, who issued from the tomb. The Maoris were in the\nsame place, surrounding the foot of the peak, and uttering terrible\ncries.\n\n\"Cry and howl till you are tired, miserable creatures!\" said Paganel.\n\"I defy you to climb this mountain!\"\n\n\"And why?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"Because the chief is buried here; this tomb protects us, and the\nmountain is tabooed.\"\n\n\"Tabooed?\"\n\n\"Yes, my friends; and that is why I took refuge here, as in one of\nthose asylums of the Middle Ages, open to unfortunates.\"\n\nIndeed, the mountain was tabooed, and by this consecration had become\ninaccessible by the superstitious savages.\n\nThe safety of the fugitives was not yet certain, but there was a\nsalutary respite, of which they strove to take advantage. Glenarvan, a\nprey to unspeakable emotion, did not venture a word; while the major\nnodded his head with an air of genuine satisfaction.\n\n\"And now, my friends,\" said Paganel, \"if these brutes expect us to test\ntheir patience they are mistaken.

Kai-Koumou seemed equally surprised.\n\n\"Then you doubt it?\" said he.\n\n\"I do not know,\" repeated Glenarvan.\n\n\"Will not your people accept you in exchange for our Tohonga?\"\n\n\"Not me alone,\" replied Glenarvan; \"but perhaps all of us.\"\n\n\"Among the Maoris,\" said Kai-Koumou, \"it is one for one.\"\n\n\"Offer these ladies first in exchange for your priest,\" answered\nGlenarvan, pointing to Lady Helena and Mary Grant.

Moreover,\nthe unfortunate woman would not have been allowed to survive him;\nit was the custom, in accordance with duty, and examples of such\nsacrifices are not wanting in New Zealand history.

Suddenly the unfortunate\nvictim rose; but a violent blow with the \"méré,\" a formidable club,\nwielded by the hand of the chief, struck her lifeless to the earth.\n\n[Sidenote: POOR HUMANITY!]\n\nFrightful cries at once broke forth.

But for the eternal life his faithful spouse could\nnot alone suffice the deceased. Who would serve them in presence of\nNouï-Atoua, if their slaves did not follow them?\n\nSix unfortunates were brought before the corpse of their master and\nmistress. They were servants, whom the pitiless laws of war had reduced\nto slavery. During the life of the chief they had undergone the\nseverest privations, suffered a thousand abuses, had been scantily fed,\nand compelled constantly to labor like beasts; and now, according to\nthe Maori belief, they were to continue their existence of servitude\nfor eternity.\n\nThey appeared to be resigned to their fate, and were not astonished\nat a sacrifice they had long anticipated. Their freedom from all\nbonds showed that they would meet death unresistingly. Moreover, this\ndeath was rapid, protracted sufferings were spared them. These were\nreserved for the captives who stood trembling not twenty paces distant.\nSix blows of the méré, given by six stalwart warriors, stretched the\nvictims on the ground in a pool of blood. It was the signal for a\nterrible scene of cannibalism, which followed in all its horrible\ndetails.\n\nGlenarvan and his companions, breathless with fright, strove to hide\nthis awful scene from the eyes of the two unhappy ladies. They now\nunderstood what awaited them at sunrise the next day, and what cruel\ntortures would doubtless precede such a death. They were dumb with\nhorror.\n\nThe funeral dance now began. Strong spirits, extracted from an\nindigenous plant, maddened the savages till they seemed no longer\nhuman. Would they not forget the taboo of the chief, and throw\nthemselves in their final outbreaks upon the prisoners who trembled at\ntheir frenzy?\n\n[Illustration: A terrible scene of cannibalism, which followed in all\nits horrible details.]\n\n[Illustration: The corpses, folded together, in a sitting posture,\nand tied in their clothes by a girdle of withes, were placed on this\nprimitive bier.]\n\nBut Kai-Koumou had preserved his reason in the midst of the general\nintoxication.

Hurrah! three times hurrah, for Lord and\nLady Glenarvan!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nTHE DEPARTURE OF THE DUNCAN.\n\n\nIt has been already said that Lady Helena had a brave and generous\nsoul. What she had just done was an undeniable proof of it, and Lord\nGlenarvan had good reason to trust in this noble woman, who was\ncapable of comprehending and following him. The idea of sailing to\nthe rescue of Captain Grant had already taken possession of him when\nhe saw his petition rejected at London; but he could not have thought\nof separating from her. Yet, since she desired to go herself, all\nhesitation was at an end. The servants of the castle had received her\nproposal with cries of joy; the safety of their brother Scots was at\nstake, and Lord Glenarvan joined heartily in the hurrahs that greeted\nthe lady of Luss.\n\nThe scheme once resolved upon, there was not an hour to lose. That\nvery day Lord Glenarvan sent to Captain Mangles orders to bring the\nDuncan to Glasgow, and make every preparation for a voyage to the South\nSeas, which might become one of circumnavigation. Moreover, in her\nplans Lady Helena had not overestimated the qualities of the Duncan:\nof first-class construction with regard to strength and swiftness, she\ncould without injury sustain a long voyage.\n\n[Sidenote: FITTING FOR SEA.]\n\nThe Duncan was a steam yacht of one hundred and ten tons burden.\nShe had two masts,--a foremast with fore-sail, main-sail, foretop\nand foretop-gallant sails; and a mainmast, carrying a main-sail and\nfore-staff. Her rigging was, therefore, sufficient, and she could\nprofit by the wind like a simple clipper; but she relied especially\nupon her mechanical power. Her engine was of an effective force of one\nhundred and sixty horse power, and was constructed on a new plan. It\npossessed apparatus for overheating, which gave its steam a very great\ntension. It was a high-pressure engine, and produced motion by a double\nscrew. The Duncan under full steam could acquire a speed equal to any\nvessel of that day.

The savages, men, women,\nand children, to the number of several hundreds, assembled in the pah,\nsilent and calm. Kai-Koumou came out of his house, and, surrounded by\nthe principal warriors of his tribe, took his place on a mound several\nfeet high in the centre of the fortification. The crowd of natives\nformed a semicircle around him, and the whole assembly preserved\nabsolute silence.\n\nAt a sign from the chief, a warrior advanced towards the temple.\n\n\"Remember!\" said Lady Helena to her husband.\n\nGlenarvan clasped his wife to his heart. At this moment Mary Grant\napproached John Mangles.\n\n\"Lord and Lady Glenarvan,\" said she, \"I think that, if a wife can die\nby the hand of her husband to escape a degrading existence, a maiden\ncan likewise die by the hand of her lover. John (for I may tell you\nat this critical moment), have I not long been your betrothed in the\ndepths of your heart? May I rely upon you, dear John, as Lady Helena\ndoes upon Lord Glenarvan?\"\n\n\"Mary!\" cried the young captain, in terror. \"Ah! dear Mary----\"\n\nHe could not finish: the mat was raised, and the captives were dragged\ntowards Kai-Koumou. The two women were resigned to their fate, while\nthe men concealed their anguish beneath a calmness that showed\nsuperhuman self-control. They came before the chief, who did not delay\nsentence.\n\n\"You killed Kara-Tété!\" said he to Glenarvan.\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n[Sidenote: THE BEGINNING OF THE END.]\n\n\"You shall die to-morrow at sunrise.\"\n\n\"Alone?\" inquired Glenarvan, whose heart beat quickly.\n\n\"What! as if our Tohonga's life were not more precious than yours!\"\ncried Kai-Koumou, whose eyes expressed a fierce regret.\n\nAt this moment a commotion took place among the natives. Glenarvan cast\na rapid glance around him. The crowd opened, and a warrior, dripping\nwith sweat and overcome with fatigue, appeared.\n\nAs soon as Kai-Koumou perceived him, he said in English, evidently that\nhe might be understood by the captives:\n\n\"You come from the camp of the pale-faces?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the Maori.\n\n\"You saw the prisoner, our Tohonga?\"\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n\"Is he living?\"\n\n\"He is dead! The English have shot him.\"\n\nThe fate of Glenarvan and his companions was settled.\n\n\"You shall all die to-morrow at daybreak!\" cried Kai-Koumou.\n\nThe unfortunates were therefore to suffer a common death. Lady Helena\nand Mary Grant raised towards heaven a look of thankfulness.\n\nThe captives were not taken back to the temple. They were to attend\nthat day the funeral of the dead chief, and the bloody ceremonies\nconnected therewith. A party of natives conducted them to the foot of\nan enormous koudi, where these guardians remained without losing sight\nof their prisoners. The rest of the tribe, absorbed in their official\nmourning, seemed to have forgotten them.\n\nThe customary three days had elapsed since the death of Kara-Tété. The\nsoul of the deceased had therefore forever abandoned its mortal abode.\nThe sacred rites began.\n\nThe body was carried to a small mound in the centre of the\nfortification, clothed in splendid costume, and enveloped in a\nmagnificent flaxen mat. The head was adorned with plumes, and wore a\ncrown of green leaves. The face, arms, and breast had been rubbed with\noil, and therefore showed no mortification.\n\nThe parents and friends of the deceased came to the foot of the\nmound, and all at once, as if some director were beating time to a\nfuneral dirge, a great concert of cries, groans, and sobs arose on the\nair. They mourned the dead in plaintive and modulated cadences.

Three dogs of wild appearance were\nstretched at their feet. The eight rowers seemed to be servants or\nslaves of the chief. They worked vigorously, and the boat ascended the\ncurrent of the Waikato with remarkable swiftness.\n\nIn the centre of this long canoe, with feet tied, but hands free, were\nten European prisoners clinging closely to each other. They were Lord\nGlenarvan and his companions.\n\n[Sidenote: A TESTING TIME.]\n\nThe evening before, the little party, led astray by the dense fog, had\nencamped in the midst of a numerous tribe of natives. About midnight,\nthe travelers, surprised in their sleep, were made prisoners and\ncarried on board the canoe. They had not yet been maltreated, but had\ntried in vain to resist. Their arms and ammunition were in the hands of\nthe savages, and their own bullets would have quickly stretched them on\nthe earth had they attempted to escape.\n\nThey were not long in learning, by the aid of a few English words which\nthe natives used, that, being driven back by the British troops, they\nwere returning, vanquished and weakened, to the regions of the upper\nWaikato. Their chief, after an obstinate resistance, in which he lost\nhis principal warriors, was now on his way to rouse again the river\ntribes. He was called Kai-Koumou, a terrible name, which signified\nin the native language \"he who eats the limbs of his enemy.\" He was\nbrave and bold, but his cruelty equaled his bravery. No pity could be\nexpected from him. His name was well known to the English soldiers, and\na price had been set upon his head by the governor of New Zealand.\n\nThis terrible catastrophe had come upon Glenarvan just as he was\nabout reaching the long-desired harbor of Auckland, whence he would\nhave returned to his native country. Yet, looking at his calm and\npassionless countenance, you could not have divined the depth of his\nanguish, for in his present critical situation he did not betray the\nextent of his misfortunes. He felt that he ought to set an example of\nfortitude to his wife and his companions, as being the husband and\nchief. Moreover, he was ready to die first for the common safety, if\ncircumstances should require it.\n\n[Sidenote: CHIEFS, CIVILIZED AND UNCIVILIZED.]\n\nHis companions were worthy of him; they shared his noble thoughts, and\ntheir calm and haughty appearance would scarcely have intimated that\nthey were being carried away to captivity and suffering. By common\nconsent, at Glenarvan's suggestion, they had resolved to feign a proud\nindifference in the presence of the savages. It was the only way of\ninfluencing those fierce natures.\n\n[Illustration: A boat might have been seen ascending the Waikato. It\nwas a canoe seventy feet long and five broad.]\n\nSince leaving the encampment, the natives, taciturn like all savages,\nhad scarcely spoken to each other. However, from a few words exchanged,\nGlenarvan perceived that they were acquainted with the English\nlanguage. He therefore resolved to question the chief in regard to the\nfate that was in store for them. Addressing Kai-Koumou, he said, in a\nfearless tone:\n\n\"Where are you taking us, chief?\"\n\nKai-Koumou gazed at him coldly without answering.\n\n\"Say, what do you expect to do with us?\" continued Glenarvan.\n\nThe chief's eyes blazed with a sudden light, and in a stern voice he\nreplied:\n\n\"To exchange you, if your friends will ransom you; to kill you, if they\nrefuse.\"\n\nGlenarvan asked no more, but hope returned to his heart. Doubtless,\nsome chiefs of the Maori tribe had fallen into the hands of the\nEnglish, and the natives would attempt to recover them by way of\nexchange; their situation, therefore, was not one for despair.\n\nMeantime the canoe rapidly ascended the river. Paganel, whose\nchangeable disposition carried him from one extreme to another, had\nregained his hopefulness.

The two women were resigned to their fate, while\nthe men concealed their anguish beneath a calmness that showed\nsuperhuman self-control.

Glenarvan cast\na rapid glance around him. The crowd opened, and a warrior, dripping\nwith sweat and overcome with fatigue, appeared.\n\nAs soon as Kai-Koumou perceived him, he said in English, evidently that\nhe might be understood by the captives:\n\n\"You come from the camp of the pale-faces?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the Maori.\n\n\"You saw the prisoner, our Tohonga?\"\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n\"Is he living?\"\n\n\"He is dead! The English have shot him.\"\n\nThe fate of Glenarvan and his companions was settled.\n\n\"You shall all die to-morrow at daybreak!\" cried Kai-Koumou.\n\nThe unfortunates were therefore to suffer a common death. Lady Helena\nand Mary Grant raised towards heaven a look of thankfulness.\n\nThe captives were not taken back to the temple. They were to attend\nthat day the funeral of the dead chief, and the bloody ceremonies\nconnected therewith. A party of natives conducted them to the foot of\nan enormous koudi, where these guardians remained without losing sight\nof their prisoners. The rest of the tribe, absorbed in their official\nmourning, seemed to have forgotten them.\n\nThe customary three days had elapsed since the death of Kara-Tété. The\nsoul of the deceased had therefore forever abandoned its mortal abode.\nThe sacred rites began.\n\nThe body was carried to a small mound in the centre of the\nfortification, clothed in splendid costume, and enveloped in a\nmagnificent flaxen mat. The head was adorned with plumes, and wore a\ncrown of green leaves. The face, arms, and breast had been rubbed with\noil, and therefore showed no mortification.\n\nThe parents and friends of the deceased came to the foot of the\nmound, and all at once, as if some director were beating time to a\nfuneral dirge, a great concert of cries, groans, and sobs arose on the\nair. They mourned the dead in plaintive and modulated cadences. His\nrelations struck their heads together; his kinswomen lacerated their\nfaces with their nails, and showed themselves more lavish of blood than\nof tears.

He allowed this bloody orgy an hour to reach its utmost\nintensity. The last act of the funeral was played with the usual rites.\n\nThe bodies of Kara-Tété and his wife were taken up, and their limbs\nbent and gathered against the stomach, according to the New Zealand\ncustom. The place for the tomb had been chosen outside of the\nfortification, about two miles distant, on the summit of a small\nmountain, called Maunganamu, situated on the right shore of the lake.\n\nThither the bodies were to be carried. Two very rude palanquins, or\nrather litters, were brought to the foot of the mound. The corpses,\nfolded together, in a sitting posture, and tied in their clothes by a\ngirdle of withes, were placed on this primitive bier. Four warriors\nbore it between them, and the entire tribe, chanting the funeral hymn,\nfollowed them in procession to the place of burial.\n\nThe captives, who were always watched, saw them leave the inner\ninclosure of the pah, and then the songs and cries gradually died away.\nFor about half an hour this funeral escort continued in sight, in the\ndepths of the valley. Finally they perceived it again winding along\nthe mountain paths. The distance gave a fantastic appearance to the\nundulating movements of the long, sinuous column.\n\nThe tribe stopped at the summit of the mountain, which was eight\nhundred feet high, at the place prepared for Kara-Tété's interment.\nA common Maori would have had only a hole and a heap of stones for a\ngrave; but for a powerful and dreaded chief, destined doubtless for a\nspeedy deification, a tomb worthy of his exploits was reserved.\n\n[Sidenote: THE LAST NIGHT.]\n\nThe sepulchre had been surrounded by palisades, while stakes,\nornamented with faces reddened with ochre, stood beside the grave\nwhere the bodies were to lie. The relatives had not forgotten that the\n\"waidoua\" (the spirit of the dead) feeds on substantial nourishment\nlike the body during this perishable life. Food had therefore been\ndeposited in the inclosure, together with the weapons and clothes of\nthe deceased.\n\nNothing was wanting for the comfort of the tomb. Husband and wife were\nlaid side by side, and then covered with earth and grass after a series\nof renewed lamentations. Then the procession silently descended the\nmountain, and now no one could ascend it under penalty of death, for it\nwas tabooed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LI.\n\nSTRANGELY LIBERATED.\n\n\nJust as the sun was disappearing behind Lake Taupo, the captives were\nled back to their prison. They were not to leave it again until the\nsummit of the Wahiti mountains should kindle with the first beams of\nthe day. One night remained to prepare for death. In spite of the\nfaintness, in spite of the horror with which they were seized, they\nshared their repast in common.\n\n\"We shall need all the strength possible to face death,\" said\nGlenarvan. \"We must show these barbarians how Europeans and Christians\ncan die.\"\n\nThe meal being finished, Lady Helena repeated the evening prayer aloud,\nwhile all her companions, with uncovered heads, joined her. Having\nfulfilled this duty, and enjoyed this privilege, the prisoners embraced\neach other. Lady Helena and Mary Grant then retired to one corner of\nthe hut, and stretched themselves upon a mat. Sleep, which soothes all\nwoes, soon closed their eyes, and they slumbered in each other's arms,\novercome by fatigue and long wakefulness.\n\nGlenarvan, taking his friends aside, said:\n\n\"My dear companions, our lives and those of these poor ladies are in\nGod's hands. If Heaven has decreed that we shall die to-morrow, we can,\nI am sure, die like brave people, like Christians, ready to appear\nfearlessly before the final Judge.

These unfortunate females conscientiously fulfilled their\nbarbarous duty.\n\nBut these demonstrations were not enough to appease the soul of the\ndeceased, whose wrath would doubtless have smitten the survivors of his\ntribe; and his warriors, as they could not recall him to life, wished\nthat he should have no cause to regret in the other world the happiness\nof this.\n\nKara-Tété's wife was not to forsake her husband in the tomb. Moreover,\nthe unfortunate woman would not have been allowed to survive him;\nit was the custom, in accordance with duty, and examples of such\nsacrifices are not wanting in New Zealand history. The woman appeared.\nShe was still young. Her hair floated in disorder over her shoulders.\nVague words, lamentations, and broken phrases, in which she celebrated\nthe virtues of the dead, interrupted her groans; and, in a final\nparoxysm of grief, she stretched herself at the foot of the mound,\nbeating the ground with her head.\n\nAt this moment Kai-Koumou approached her. Suddenly the unfortunate\nvictim rose; but a violent blow with the \"méré,\" a formidable club,\nwielded by the hand of the chief, struck her lifeless to the earth.\n\n[Sidenote: POOR HUMANITY!]\n\nFrightful cries at once broke forth. A hundred arms threatened the\ncaptives, who trembled at the horrible sight. But no one stirred, for\nthe funeral ceremonies were not ended.\n\nKara-Tété's wife had joined her husband in the other world. Both bodies\nlay side by side. But for the eternal life his faithful spouse could\nnot alone suffice the deceased. Who would serve them in presence of\nNouï-Atoua, if their slaves did not follow them?\n\nSix unfortunates were brought before the corpse of their master and\nmistress. They were servants, whom the pitiless laws of war had reduced\nto slavery. During the life of the chief they had undergone the\nseverest privations, suffered a thousand abuses, had been scantily fed,\nand compelled constantly to labor like beasts; and now, according to\nthe Maori belief, they were to continue their existence of servitude\nfor eternity.\n\nThey appeared to be resigned to their fate, and were not astonished\nat a sacrifice they had long anticipated. Their freedom from all\nbonds showed that they would meet death unresistingly. Moreover, this\ndeath was rapid, protracted sufferings were spared them. These were\nreserved for the captives who stood trembling not twenty paces distant.\nSix blows of the méré, given by six stalwart warriors, stretched the\nvictims on the ground in a pool of blood. It was the signal for a\nterrible scene of cannibalism, which followed in all its horrible\ndetails.\n\nGlenarvan and his companions, breathless with fright, strove to hide\nthis awful scene from the eyes of the two unhappy ladies. They now\nunderstood what awaited them at sunrise the next day, and what cruel\ntortures would doubtless precede such a death. They were dumb with\nhorror.\n\nThe funeral dance now began. Strong spirits, extracted from an\nindigenous plant, maddened the savages till they seemed no longer\nhuman. Would they not forget the taboo of the chief, and throw\nthemselves in their final outbreaks upon the prisoners who trembled at\ntheir frenzy?\n\n[Illustration: A terrible scene of cannibalism, which followed in all\nits horrible details.]\n\n[Illustration: The corpses, folded together, in a sitting posture,\nand tied in their clothes by a girdle of withes, were placed on this\nprimitive bier.]\n\nBut Kai-Koumou had preserved his reason in the midst of the general\nintoxication.

What,\nmoreover, could ten defenceless men do against thirty well-armed\nsavages? Besides, Glenarvan thought it likely that Kai-Koumou's tribe\nhad lost some chief of high rank whom they were particularly anxious to\nrecover; and he was not mistaken.\n\nThe next day the canoe ascended the river with increased swiftness.\nIt stopped for a moment at the junction of a small river which wound\nacross the plains on the right bank. Here another canoe, with ten\nnatives on board, joined Kai-Koumou. The warriors merely exchanged\nsalutations, and then continued their course. The new-comers had\nrecently fought against the English troops, as could be seen by their\ntattered garments, their gory weapons, and the wounds that still bled\nbeneath their rags. They were gloomy and taciturn, and, with the\nindifference common to all savage races, paid no attention to the\ncaptives.\n\nTowards evening Kai-Koumou landed at the foot of the mountains,\nwhose nearer ridges reached precipitously to the river-bank. Here\ntwenty natives, who had disembarked from their canoes, were making\npreparations for the night. Fires blazed beneath the trees. A chief,\nequal in rank to Kai-Koumou, advanced with measured pace, and, rubbing\nhis nose against that of the latter, saluted him cordially. The\nprisoners were stationed in the centre of the encampment, and guarded\nwith extreme vigilance.\n\nThe next morning the ascent of the Waikato was resumed. Other boats\ncame from various affluents of the river. Sixty warriors, evidently\nfugitives from the last insurrection, had now assembled, and were\nreturning, more or less wounded in the fray, to the mountain districts.\nSometimes a song arose from the canoes, as they advanced in single\nfile. One native struck up the patriotic ode of the mysterious \"Pihé,\"\nthe national hymn that calls the Maoris to battle. The full and\nsonorous voice of the singer waked the echoes of the mountains; and\nafter each stanza his comrades struck their breasts, and sang the\nwarlike verses in chorus. Then they seized their oars again, and the\ncanoes were headed up stream.\n\nDuring the day a singular sight enlivened the voyage. About four\no'clock the canoe, without lessening its speed, guided by the steady\nhand of the chief, dashed through a narrow gorge. Eddies broke\nviolently against numerous small islands, which rendered navigation\nexceeding dangerous. Never could it be more hazardous to capsize, for\nthe banks afforded no refuge, and whoever had set foot on the porous\ncrust of the shore would probably have perished. At this point the\nriver flowed between warm springs, oxide of iron colored the muddy\nground a brilliant red, and not a yard of firm earth could be seen.\nThe air was heavy with a penetrating sulphureous odor. The natives did\nnot regard it, but the captives were seriously annoyed by the noxious\nvapors exhaled from the fissures of the soil and the bubbles that\nburst and discharged their gaseous contents. Yet, however disagreeable\nthese emanations were, the eye could not but admire this magnificent\nspectacle.\n\n[Illustration: At this point the river flowed between warm springs, and\nnot a yard of firm earth could be seen.]\n\nThe canoes soon after entered a dense cloud of white smoke, whose\nwreaths rose in gradually decreasing circles above the river. On the\nshores a hundred geysers, some shooting forth masses of vapor, and\nothers overflowing in liquid columns, varied their effects, like the\njets and cascades of a fountain. It seemed as though some engineer was\ndirecting at his pleasure the outflowings of these springs, as the\nwaters and vapor, mingling in the air, formed rainbows in the sunbeams.\n\nFor two miles the canoes glided within this vapory atmosphere,\nenveloped in its warm waves that rolled along the surface of the water.\nThen the sulphureous smoke disappeared, and a pure swift current of\nfresh air refreshed the panting voyagers. The region of the springs was\npassed.

A few moments after\nthey were led back to the temple that served as their prison; but\nRobert Grant and Paganel were no longer with them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER L.\n\nTHE CHIEF'S FUNERAL.\n\n\nKai-Koumou, according to a custom quite ordinary in New Zealand, joined\nthe rank of priest to that of chief, and could, therefore, extend to\npersons or objects the superstitious protection of the taboo.\n\nThe taboo, which is common to the tribes of Polynesia, has the power\nto prohibit at once all connection with the object or person tabooed.\nAccording to the Maori religion, whoever should lay his sacrilegious\nhand on what is declared taboo would be punished with death by the\noffended god; and in case the divinity should delay to avenge his own\ninsult, the priests would not fail to excite his anger.\n\nAs for the prisoners confined in the temple, the taboo had rescued\nthem from the fury of the tribe. Some of the natives, the friends and\npartisans of Kai-Koumou, had stopped suddenly at the command of their\nchief, and had protected the captives.\n\n[Sidenote: THE TORTURES OF SUSPENSE.]\n\nGlenarvan, however, was not blind to the fate that was reserved for\nhim. Only his death could atone for the murder of a chief. Among savage\nraces death is always preceded by a protracted torture. He therefore\nexpected to cruelly expiate the righteous indignation that had nerved\nhis arm, but hoped that Kai-Koumou's rage would fall only on himself.\n\nWhat a night he and his companions passed! Who could depict their\nanguish, or measure their sufferings? Neither poor Robert nor brave\nPaganel had reappeared. But how could they doubt their fate? Were they\nnot the first victims of the natives' vengeance? All hope had vanished\neven from the heart of the major, who did not easily despair. John\nMangles felt himself growing mad at sight of the sad dejection of Mary\nGrant, thus separated from her brother. Glenarvan thought of that\nterrible request of Lady Helena, who, rather than yield to torture or\nslavery, preferred to die by his hand. Could he summon this fearful\ncourage? As for an escape, that was plainly impossible. Ten warriors,\narmed to the teeth, guarded the entrance of the temple.\n\nMorning came at last. There had been no communication between the\nnatives and the prisoners. The hut contained a considerable quantity\nof food, which the unfortunates scarcely touched. Hunger gave place to\ngrief.

The crowd opened, and a warrior, dripping\nwith sweat and overcome with fatigue, appeared.\n\nAs soon as Kai-Koumou perceived him, he said in English, evidently that\nhe might be understood by the captives:\n\n\"You come from the camp of the pale-faces?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the Maori.\n\n\"You saw the prisoner, our Tohonga?\"\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n\"Is he living?\"\n\n\"He is dead! The English have shot him.\"\n\nThe fate of Glenarvan and his companions was settled.\n\n\"You shall all die to-morrow at daybreak!\" cried Kai-Koumou.\n\nThe unfortunates were therefore to suffer a common death. Lady Helena\nand Mary Grant raised towards heaven a look of thankfulness.\n\nThe captives were not taken back to the temple. They were to attend\nthat day the funeral of the dead chief, and the bloody ceremonies\nconnected therewith. A party of natives conducted them to the foot of\nan enormous koudi, where these guardians remained without losing sight\nof their prisoners. The rest of the tribe, absorbed in their official\nmourning, seemed to have forgotten them.\n\nThe customary three days had elapsed since the death of Kara-Tété. The\nsoul of the deceased had therefore forever abandoned its mortal abode.\nThe sacred rites began.\n\nThe body was carried to a small mound in the centre of the\nfortification, clothed in splendid costume, and enveloped in a\nmagnificent flaxen mat. The head was adorned with plumes, and wore a\ncrown of green leaves. The face, arms, and breast had been rubbed with\noil, and therefore showed no mortification.\n\nThe parents and friends of the deceased came to the foot of the\nmound, and all at once, as if some director were beating time to a\nfuneral dirge, a great concert of cries, groans, and sobs arose on the\nair. They mourned the dead in plaintive and modulated cadences. His\nrelations struck their heads together; his kinswomen lacerated their\nfaces with their nails, and showed themselves more lavish of blood than\nof tears. These unfortunate females conscientiously fulfilled their\nbarbarous duty.\n\nBut these demonstrations were not enough to appease the soul of the\ndeceased, whose wrath would doubtless hav"}, {"chunk_id": 196, "text": "scene of cannibalism, which followed in all\nits horrible details.]\n\n[Illustration: The corpses, folded together, in a sitting posture,\nand tied in their clothes by a girdle of withes, were placed on this\nprimitive bier.]\n\nBut Kai-Koumou had preserved his reason in the midst of the general\nintoxication. He allowed this bloody orgy an hour to reach its utmost\nintensity. The last act of the funeral was played with the usual rites.\n\nThe bodies of Kara-Tété and his wife were taken up, and their limbs\nbent and gathered against the stomach, according to the New Zealand\ncustom. The place for the tomb had been chosen outside of the\nfortification, about two miles distant, on the summit of a small\nmountain, called Maunganamu, situated on the right shore of the lake.\n\nThither the bodies were to be carried. Two very rude palanquins, or\nrather litters, were brought to the foot of the mound. The corpses,\nfolded together, in a sitting posture, and tied in their clothes by a\ngirdle of withes, were placed on this primitive bier. Four warriors\nbore it between them, and the entire tribe, chanting the funeral hymn,\nfollowed them in procession to the place of burial.\n\nThe captives, who were always watched, saw them leave the inner\ninclosure of the pah, and then the songs and cries gradually died away.\nFor about half an hour this funeral escort continued in sight, in the\ndepths of the valley. Finally they perceived it again winding along\nthe mountain paths. The distance gave a fantastic appearance to the\nundulating movements of the long, sinuous column.\n\nThe tribe stopped at the summit of the mountain, which was eight\nhundred feet high, at the place prepared for Kara-Tété's interment.\nA common Maori would have had only a hole and a heap of stones for a\ngrave; but for a powerful and dreaded chief, destined doubtless for a\nspeedy deification, a tomb worthy of his exploits was reserved.\n\n[Sidenote: THE LAST NIGHT.]\n\nThe sepulchre had been surrounded by palisades, while stakes,\nornamented with faces reddened with ochre, stood beside the grave\nwhere the bodies were to lie. The relatives had not forgotten that the\n\"waidoua\" (the spirit of the dead) feeds on substantial nourishment\nlike the body during this perishable life. Food had therefore been\ndeposited in the inclosure, together with the weapons and clothes of\nthe deceased.\n\nNothing was wanting for the comfort of the tomb. Husband and wife were\nlaid side by side, and then covered with earth and grass after a series\nof renewed lamentations. Then the procession silently descended the\nmountain, and now no one could ascend it under penalty of death, for it\nwas tabooed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LI.\n\nSTRANGELY LIBERATED.\n\n\nJust as the sun was disappearing behind Lake Taupo, the captives were\nled back to their prison.

In spite of the\nfaintness, in spite of the horror with which they were seized, they\nshared their repast in common.\n\n\"We shall need all the strength possible to face death,\" said\nGlenarvan. \"We must show these barbarians how Europeans and Christians\ncan die.\"\n\nThe meal being finished, Lady Helena repeated the evening prayer aloud,\nwhile all her companions, with uncovered heads, joined her.

Yet, looking at his calm and\npassionless countenance, you could not have divined the depth of his\nanguish, for in his present critical situation he did not betray the\nextent of his misfortunes. He felt that he ought to set an example of\nfortitude to his wife and his companions, as being the husband and\nchief. Moreover, he was ready to die first for the common safety, if\ncircumstances should require it.\n\n[Sidenote: CHIEFS, CIVILIZED AND UNCIVILIZED.]\n\nHis companions were worthy of him; they shared his noble thoughts, and\ntheir calm and haughty appearance would scarcely have intimated that\nthey were being carried away to captivity and suffering.

It was the only way of\ninfluencing those fierce natures.\n\n[Illustration: A boat might have been seen ascending the Waikato. It\nwas a canoe seventy feet long and five broad.]\n\nSince leaving the encampment, the natives, taciturn like all savages,\nhad scarcely spoken to each other. However, from a few words exchanged,\nGlenarvan perceived that they were acquainted with the English\nlanguage. He therefore resolved to question the chief in regard to the\nfate that was in store for them. Addressing Kai-Koumou, he said, in a\nfearless tone:\n\n\"Where are you taking us, chief?\"\n\nKai-Koumou gazed at him coldly without answering.\n\n\"Say, what do you expect to do with us?\" continued Glenarvan.\n\nThe chief's eyes blazed with a sudden light, and in a stern voice he\nreplied:\n\n\"To exchange you, if your friends will ransom you; to kill you, if they\nrefuse.\"\n\nGlenarvan asked no more, but hope returned to his heart. Doubtless,\nsome chiefs of the Maori tribe had fallen into the hands of the\nEnglish, and the natives would attempt to recover them by way of\nexchange; their situation, therefore, was not one for despair.\n\nMeantime the canoe rapidly ascended the river.

A few moments after\nthey were led back to the temple that served as their prison; but\nRobert Grant and Paganel were no longer with them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER L.\n\nTHE CHIEF'S FUNERAL.\n\n\nKai-Koumou, according to a custom quite ordinary in New Zealand, joined\nthe rank of priest to that of chief, and could, therefore, extend to\npersons or objects the superstitious protection of the taboo.\n\nThe taboo, which is common to the tribes of Polynesia, has the power\nto prohibit at once all connection with the object or person tabooed.\nAccording to the Maori religion, whoever should lay his sacrilegious\nhand on what is declared taboo would be punished with death by the\noffended god; and in case the divinity should delay to avenge his own\ninsult, the priests would not fail to excite his anger.\n\nAs for the prisoners confined in the temple, the taboo had rescued\nthem from the fury of the tribe. Some of the natives, the friends and\npartisans of Kai-Koumou, had stopped suddenly at the command of their\nchief, and had protected the captives.\n\n[Sidenote: THE TORTURES OF SUSPENSE.]\n\nGlenarvan, however, was not blind to the fate that was reserved for\nhim. Only his death could atone for the murder of a chief. Among savage\nraces death is always preceded by a protracted torture. He therefore\nexpected to cruelly expiate the righteous indignation that had nerved\nhis arm, but hoped that Kai-Koumou's rage would fall only on himself.\n\nWhat a night he and his companions passed! Who could depict their\nanguish, or measure their sufferings? Neither poor Robert nor brave\nPaganel had reappeared. But how could they doubt their fate? Were they\nnot the first victims of the natives' vengeance? All hope had vanished\neven from the heart of the major, who did not easily despair. John\nMangles felt himself growing mad at sight of the sad dejection of Mary\nGrant, thus separated from her brother. Glenarvan thought of that\nterrible request of Lady Helena, who, rather than yield to torture or\nslavery, preferred to die by his hand. Could he summon this fearful\ncourage? As for an escape, that was plainly impossible. Ten warriors,\narmed to the teeth, guarded the entrance of the temple.\n\nMorning came at last. There had been no communication between the\nnatives and the prisoners. The hut contained a considerable quantity\nof food, which the unfortunates scarcely touched. Hunger gave place to\ngrief. The day passed without bringing a change or a hope. Doubtless\nthe hour for the dead chief's funeral and their torture would be the\nsame.\n\nHowever, although Glenarvan concluded that Kai-Koumou must have\nabandoned all idea of exchange, the major on this point retained a\ngleam of hope.\n\n\"Who knows,\" said he, reminding Glenarvan of the effect produced upon\nthe chief by the death of Kara-Tété,--\"who knows but that Kai-Koumou in\nreality feels obliged to you?\"\n\nBut, in spite of these observations, Glenarvan would no longer hope.\nThe next day also passed away without the preparations for torture\nbeing made. The reason of the delay was this.\n\nThe Maoris believe that the soul, for three days after death, inhabits\nthe body of the deceased, and therefore during this time the corpse\nremains unburied. This custom was rigorously observed, and for two days\nthe pah was deserted. Captain Mangles frequently stood on Wilson's\nshoulders and surveyed the fortification. No native was seen; only the\nsentinels guarded in turn at the door of their prison.\n\nBut on the third day the huts were opened. The savages, men, women,\nand children, to the number of several hundreds, assembled in the pah,\nsilent and calm. Kai-Koumou came out of his house, and, surrounded by\nthe principal warriors of his tribe, took his place on a mound several\nfeet high in the centre of the fortification.

The silence of sleeping nature was broken only\nby the sound of the horses' chains as they rattled against their feet.\nPaganel was becoming fully absorbed in his astronomical meditations,\nand occupying himself more with the things of heaven than those of\nearth, when a distant sound startled him from his reverie.\n\nHe listened attentively, and, to his great astonishment, thought he\ndistinguished the tones of a piano. A few boldly-struck chords wafted\nto his ears their harmonious vibrations. He could not be mistaken.\n\n\"A piano in the desert!\" said he to himself. \"It cannot be!\"\n\nIt was indeed very surprising, and Paganel began to think that some\nstrange Australian bird was imitating the sound of the instrument.\n\n[Sidenote: A TWOFOLD SURPRISE.]\n\nBut at that moment a voice, harmoniously pitched, was heard. The\npianist was accompanied by a vocalist. The geographer listened\nincredulously, but in a few moments was forced to recognize the\nsublime air that struck upon his ear.

The\neffect of this sweet melody, in the stillness of the starlit night,\nwas indescribable. He remained a long time under the influences of its\nenchantment. At last the voice ceased, and all was silent.\n\nWhen Wilson came to relieve the geographer, he found him wrapt in a\nprofound reverie. Paganel said nothing to the sailor, but, reserving\nhis account of the incident for Glenarvan the next day, he crept into\nthe tent.\n\nIn the morning the whole party were awakened by unexpected bayings.\nGlenarvan at once arose. Two magnificent pointers were gamboling along\nthe edge of a small wood; but at the approach of the travelers they\ndisappeared among the trees, barking loudly.\n\n\"There must be a station in this desert,\" said Glenarvan, \"and hunters,\nsince those are hunting-dogs.\"\n\nPaganel was just about to relate his experiences of the past night,\nwhen two men appeared, in hunting costume, mounted on fine horses. They\nnaturally stopped at sight of the little party, encamped in gypsy-like\nfashion, and seemed to be wondering what the presence of armed men in\nthis place meant, when they perceived the ladies, who were alighting\nfrom the cart.\n\nThey immediately dismounted, and advanced towards them, hat in hand.\nGlenarvan went to meet them, and introduced himself and party, giving\nthe name and rank of each member. The young men bowed, and one of them,\nthe elder, said:\n\n\"My lord, will your ladies, your companions, and yourself do us the\nhonor to accompany us to our house?\"\n\n\"May I ask, gentlemen, whom I have the honor of addressing?\" inquired\nGlenarvan.\n\n\"Michael and Alexander Patterson, proprietors of Hottam Station.

Morrel,” replied Villefort. “The order of\nimprisonment came from high authority, and the order for his liberation\nmust proceed from the same source; and, as Napoleon has scarcely been\nreinstated a fortnight, the letters have not yet been forwarded.”\n\n“But,” said Morrel, “is there no way of expediting all these\nformalities—of releasing him from arrest?”\n\n“There has been no arrest.”\n\n“How?”\n\n“It is sometimes essential to government to cause a man’s disappearance\nwithout leaving any traces, so that no written forms or documents may\ndefeat their wishes.”\n\n“It might be so under the Bourbons, but at present——”\n\n“It has always been so, my dear Morrel, since the reign of Louis XIV.\nThe emperor is more strict in prison discipline than even Louis\nhimself, and the number of prisoners whose names are not on the\nregister is incalculable.” Had Morrel even any suspicions, so much\nkindness would have dispelled them.\n\n“Well, M. de Villefort, how would you advise me to act?” asked he.\n\n“Petition the minister.”\n\n“Oh, I know what that is; the minister receives two hundred petitions\nevery day, and does not read three.”\n\n“That is true; but he will read a petition countersigned and presented\nby me.”\n\n“And will you undertake to deliver it?”\n\n“With the greatest pleasure. Dantès was then guilty, and now he is\ninnocent, and it is as much my duty to free him as it was to condemn\nhim.” Villefort thus forestalled any danger of an inquiry, which,\nhowever improbable it might be, if it did take place would leave him\ndefenceless.\n\n“But how shall I address the minister?”\n\n“Sit down there,” said Villefort, giving up his place to Morrel, “and\nwrite what I dictate.”\n\n“Will you be so good?”\n\n“Certainly. But lose no time; we have lost too much already.”\n\n“That is true. Only think what the poor fellow may even now be\nsuffering.”\n\nVillefort shuddered at the suggestion; but he had gone too far to draw\nback. Dantès must be crushed to gratify Villefort’s ambition.\n\nVillefort dictated a petition, in which, from an excellent intention,\nno doubt, Dantès’ patriotic services were exaggerated, and he was made\nout one of the most active agents of Napoleon’s return. It was evident\nthat at the sight of this document the minister would instantly release\nhim. The petition finished, Villefort read it aloud.\n\n“That will do,” said he; “leave the rest to me.”\n\n“Will the petition go soon?”\n\n“Today.”\n\n“Countersigned by you?”\n\n“The best thing I can do will be to certify the truth of the contents\nof your petition.” And, sitting down, Villefort wrote the certificate\nat the bottom.\n\n“What more is to be done?”\n\n“I will do whatever is necessary.” This assurance delighted Morrel, who\ntook leave of Villefort, and hastened to announce to old Dantès that he\nwould soon see his son.\n\nAs for Villefort, instead of sending to Paris, he carefully preserved\nthe petition that so fearfully compromised Dantès, in the hopes of an\nevent that seemed not unlikely,—that is, a second restoration. Dantès\nremained a prisoner, and heard not the noise of the fall of Louis\nXVIII.’s throne, or the still more tragic destruction of the empire.\n\nTwice during the Hundred Days had Morrel renewed his demand, and twice\nhad Villefort soothed him with promises. At last there was Waterloo,\nand Morrel came no more; he had done all that was in his power, and any\nfresh attempt would only compromise himself uselessly.\n\nLouis XVIII. remounted the throne; Villefort, to whom Marseilles had\nbecome filled with remorseful memories, sought and obtained the\nsituation of king’s procureur at Toulouse, and a fortnight afterwards\nhe married Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran, whose father now stood higher\nat court than ever.\n\nAnd so Dantès, after the Hundred Days and after Waterloo, remained in\nhis dungeon, forgotten of earth and heaven.\n\nDanglars comprehended the full extent of the wretched fate that\noverwhelmed Dantès; and, when Napoleon retu"}, {"chunk_id": 708, "text": "N, and carried me into a garden,\nwhere he buried me alive.”\n\nA shudder ran through the assembly when they saw that the confidence of\nthe prisoner increased in proportion to the terror of M. de Villefort.\n\n“But how have you become acquainted with all these details?” asked the\npresident.\n\n“I will tell you, Mr. President. A man who had sworn vengeance against\nmy father, and had long watched his opportunity to kill him, had\nintroduced himself that night into the garden in which my father buried\nme. He was concealed in a thicket; he saw my father bury something in\nthe ground, and stabbed him; then thinking the deposit might contain\nsome treasure he turned up the ground, and found me still living. The\nman carried me to the foundling asylum, where I was registered under\nthe number 37. Three months afterwards, a woman travelled from Rogliano\nto Paris to fetch me, and having claimed me as her son, carried me\naway. Thus, you see, though born in Paris, I was brought up in\nCorsica.”\n\nThere was a moment’s silence, during which one could have fancied the\nhall empty, so profound was the stillness.\n\n“Proceed,” said the president.\n\n“Certainly, I might have lived happily amongst those good people, who\nadored me, but my perverse disposition prevailed over the virtues which\nmy adopted mother endeavored to instil into my heart. I increased in\nwickedness till I committed crime. One day when I cursed Providence for\nmaking me so wicked, and ordaining me to such a fate, my adopted father\nsaid to me, ‘Do not blaspheme, unhappy child, the crime is that of your\nfather, not yours,—of your father, who consigned you to hell if you\ndied, and to misery if a miracle preserved you alive.’ After that I\nceased to blaspheme, but I cursed my father. That is why I have uttered\nthe words for which you blame me; that is why I have filled this whole\nassembly with horror. If I have committed an additional crime, punish\nme, but if you will allow that ever since the day of my birth my fate\nhas been sad, bitter, and lamentable, then pity me.”\n\n“But your mother?” asked the president.\n\n“My mother thought me dead; she is not guilty. I did not even wish to\nknow her name, nor do I know it.”\n\nJust then a piercing cry, ending in a sob, burst from the centre of the\ncrowd, who encircled the lady who had before fainted, and who now fell\ninto a violent fit of hysterics. She was carried out of the hall, the\nthick veil which concealed her face dropped off, and Madame Danglars\nwas recognized. Notwithstanding his shattered nerves, the ringing\nsensation in his ears, and the madness which turned his brain,\nVillefort rose as he perceived her.\n\n“The proofs, the proofs!” said the president; “remember this tissue of\nhorrors must be supported by the clearest proofs.”\n\n“The proofs?” said Benedetto, laughing; “do you want proofs?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Well, then, look at M. de Villefort, and then ask me for proofs.”\n\nEveryone turned towards the procureur, who, unable to bear the\nuniversal gaze now riveted on him alone, advanced staggering into the\nmidst of the tribunal, with his hair dishevelled and his face indented\nwith the mark of his nails. The whole assembly uttered a long murmur of\nastonishment.\n\n“Father,” said Benedetto, “I am asked for proofs, do you wish me to\ngive them?”\n\n“No, no, it is useless,” stammered M. de Villefort in a hoarse voice;\n“no, it is useless!”\n\n“How useless?” cried the president, “what do you mean?”\n\n“I mean that I feel it impossible to struggle against this deadly\nweight which crushes me. Gentlemen, I know I am in the hands of an\navenging God! We need no proofs; everything relating to this young man\nis true.”\n\nA dull, gloomy silence, like that which precedes some awful phenomenon\nof nature, pervaded the assembly, who shuddered in dismay.\n\n“What, M. de Villefort,” cried the president, “do you yield to an\nhallucination? What, are you no longer in possession of your senses?\nThis strange, unexpected, terrible accusation has disordered your\nreason. Come, recover.”\n\nThe procureur drop"}, {"chunk_id": 31, "text": "hus called up; “but bear in mind, if you\nplease, that our respective parents underwent persecution and\nproscription from diametrically opposite principles; in proof of which\nI may remark, that while my family remained among the staunchest\nadherents of the exiled princes, your father lost no time in joining\nthe new government; and that while the Citizen Noirtier was a Girondin,\nthe Count Noirtier became a senator.”\n\n“Dear mother,” interposed Renée, “you know very well it was agreed that\nall these disagreeable reminiscences should forever be laid aside.”\n\n“Suffer me, also, madame,” replied Villefort, “to add my earnest\nrequest to Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran’s, that you will kindly allow\nthe veil of oblivion to cover and conceal the past. What avails\nrecrimination over matters wholly past recall? For my own part, I have\nlaid aside even the name of my father, and altogether disown his\npolitical principles. He was—nay, probably may still be—a Bonapartist,\nand is called Noirtier; I, on the contrary, am a staunch royalist, and\nstyle myself de Villefort.

Come,\nnow, I have hopes of obtaining what I have been for years endeavoring\nto persuade the marquise to promise; namely, a perfect amnesty and\nforgetfulness of the past.”\n\n“With all my heart,” replied the marquise; “let the past be forever\nforgotten. I promise you it affords _me_ as little pleasure to revive\nit as it does you. All I ask is, that Villefort will be firm and\ninflexible for the future in his political principles. Remember, also,\nVillefort, that we have pledged ourselves to his majesty for your\nfealty and strict loyalty, and that at our recommendation the king\nconsented to forget the past, as I do” (and here she extended to him\nher hand)—“as I now do at your entreaty. But bear in mind, that should\nthere fall in your way anyone guilty of conspiring against the\ngovernment, you will be so much the more bound to visit the offence\nwith rigorous punishment, as it is known you belong to a suspected\nfamily.”\n\n“Alas, madame,” returned Villefort, “my profession, as well as the\ntimes in which we live, compels me to be severe. I have already\nsuccessfully conducted several public prosecutions, and brought the\noffenders to merited punishment. But we have not done with the thing\nyet.”\n\n0087m\n\n\n\n“Do you, indeed, think so?” inquired the marquise.\n\n“I am, at least, fearful of it. Napoleon, in the Island of Elba, is too\nnear France, and his proximity keeps up the hopes of his partisans.\nMarseilles is filled with half-pay officers, who are daily, under one\nfrivolous pretext or other, getting up quarrels with the royalists;\nfrom hence arise continual and fatal duels among the higher classes of\npersons, and assassinations in the lower.”\n\n“You have heard, perhaps,” said the Comte de Salvieux, one of M. de\nSaint-Méran’s oldest friends, and chamberlain to the Comte d’Artois,\n“that the Holy Alliance purpose removing him from thence?”\n\n“Yes; they were talking about it when we left Paris,” said M. de\nSaint-Méran; “and where is it decided to transfer him?”\n\n“To Saint Helena.”\n\n“For heaven’s sake, where is that?” asked the marquise.\n\n“An island situated on the other side of the equator, at least two\nthousand leagues from here,” replied the count.\n\n“So much the better. As Villefort observes, it is a great act of folly\nto have left such a man between Corsica, where he was born, and Naples,\nof which his brother-in-law is king, and face to face with Italy, the\nsovereignty of which he coveted for his son.”\n\n“Unfortunately,” said Villefort, “there are the treaties of 1814, and\nwe cannot molest Napoleon without breaking those compacts.”\n\n“Oh, well, we"}]}

Noirtier, seeing Barrois in this pitiable condition, showed\nby his looks all the various emotions of sorrow and sympathy which can\nanimate the heart of man. Barrois made some steps towards his master.\n\n“Ah, sir,” said he, “tell me what is the matter with me. I am\nsuffering—I cannot see. A thousand fiery darts are piercing my brain.\nAh, don’t touch me, pray don’t.”\n\nBy this time his haggard eyes had the appearance of being ready to\nstart from their sockets; his head fell back, and the lower extremities\nof the body began to stiffen.

Teresa had become alarmed at the wild and deserted look of the\nplain around her, and pressed closely against her guide, not uttering a\nsyllable; but as she saw him advance with even step and composed\ncountenance, she endeavored to repress her emotion.\n\n“Suddenly, about ten paces from them, a man advanced from behind a tree\nand aimed at Vampa.\n\n“‘Not another step,’ he said, ‘or you are a dead man.’\n\n“‘What, then,’ said Vampa, raising his hand with a gesture of disdain,\nwhile Teresa, no longer able to restrain her alarm, clung closely to\nhim, ‘do wolves rend each other?’\n\n“‘Who are you?’ inquired the sentinel.\n\n“‘I am Luigi Vampa, shepherd of the San-Felice farm.’\n\n“‘What do you want?’\n\n“‘I would speak with your companions who are in the glade at Rocca\nBianca.’\n\n“‘Follow me, then,’ said the sentinel; ‘or, as you know your way, go\nfirst.’\n\n“Vampa smiled disdainfully at this precaution on the part of the\nbandit, went before Teresa, and continued to advance with the same firm\nand easy step as before. At the end of ten minutes the bandit made them\na sign to stop. The two young persons obeyed. Then the bandit thrice\nimitated the cry of a crow; a croak answered this signal.\n\n“‘Good!’ said the sentry, ‘you may now go on.’\n\n“Luigi and Teresa again set forward; as they went on Teresa clung\ntremblingly to her lover at the sight of weapons and the glistening of\ncarbines through the trees. The retreat of Rocca Bianca was at the top\nof a small mountain, which no doubt in former days had been a\nvolcano—an extinct volcano before the days when Remus and Romulus had\ndeserted Alba to come and found the city of Rome.\n\n“Teresa and Luigi reached the summit, and all at once found themselves\nin the presence of twenty bandits.\n\n“‘Here is a young man who seeks and wishes to speak to you,’ said the\nsentinel.\n\n“‘What has he to say?’ inquired the young man who was in command in the\nchief’s absence.\n\n“‘I wish to say that I am tired of a shepherd’s life,’ was Vampa’s\nreply.\n\n“‘Ah, I understand,’ said the lieutenant; ‘and you seek admittance into\nour ranks?’\n\n“‘Welcome!’ cried several bandits from Ferrusino, Pampinara, and\nAnagni, who had recognized Luigi Vampa.\n\n“‘Yes, but I came to ask something more than to be your companion.’\n\n“‘And what may that be?’ inquired the bandits with astonishment.\n\n“‘I come to ask to be your captain,’ said the young man.\n\n“The bandits shouted with laughter.\n\n“‘And what have you done to aspire to this honor?’ demanded the\nlieutenant.\n\n“‘I have killed your chief, Cucumetto, whose dress I now wear; and I\nset fire to the villa San-Felice to procure a wedding-dress for my\nbetrothed.’\n\n“An hour afterwards Luigi Vampa was chosen captain, vice Cucumetto,\ndeceased.”\n\n20129m\n\n\n\n“Well, my dear Albert,” said Franz, turning towards his friend; “what\nthink you of citizen Luigi Vampa?”\n\n“I say he is a myth,” replied Albert, “and never had an existence.”\n\n“And what may a myth be?” inquired Pastrini.\n\n“The explanation would be too long, my dear landlord,” replied Franz.\n\n“And you say that Signor Vampa exercises his profession at this moment\nin the environs of Rome?”\n\n“And with a boldness of which no bandit before him ever gave an\nexample.”\n\n“Then the police have vainly tried to lay hands on him?”\n\n“Why, you see, he has a good understanding with the shepherds in the\nplains, the fishermen of the Tiber, and the smugglers of the coast.\nThey seek for him in the mountains, and he is on the waters; they\nfollow him on the waters, and he is on the open sea; then they pursue\nhim, and he has suddenly taken refuge in the islands, at Giglio,\nGiannutri, or Monte Cristo; and when they hunt for him there, he\nreappears suddenly at Albano, Tivoli, or La Riccia.”\n\n“And how does he behave towards travellers?”\n\n“Alas! his plan is very simple.

Everything is in readiness for our\nflight, and we can select any time we choose. As soon as you feel able\nto swim we will go.”\n\n“I shall never swim again,” replied Faria. “This arm is paralyzed; not\nfor a time, but forever. Lift it, and judge if I am mistaken.”\n\nThe young man raised the arm, which fell back by its own weight,\nperfectly inanimate and helpless. A sigh escaped him.\n\n“You are convinced now, Edmond, are you not?” asked the abbé. “Depend\nupon it, I know what I say. Since the first attack I experienced of\nthis malady, I have continually reflected on it. Indeed, I expected it,\nfor it is a family inheritance; both my father and grandfather died of\nit in a third attack. The physician who prepared for me the remedy I\nhave twice successfully taken, was no other than the celebrated\nCabanis, and he predicted a similar end for me.”\n\n0233m\n\n\n\n“The physician may be mistaken!” exclaimed Dantès. “And as for your\npoor arm, what difference will that make? I can take you on my\nshoulders, and swim for both of us.”\n\n“My son,” said the abbé, “you, who are a sailor and a swimmer, must\nknow as well as I do that a man so loaded would sink before he had done\nfifty strokes. Cease, then, to allow yourself to be duped by vain\nhopes, that even your own excellent heart refuses to believe in. Here I\nshall remain till the hour of my deliverance arrives, and that, in all\nhuman probability, will be the hour of my death. As for you, who are\nyoung and active, delay not on my account, but fly—go—I give you back\nyour promise.”\n\n“It is well,” said Dantès. “Then I shall also remain.” Then, rising and\nextending his hand with an air of solemnity over the old man’s head, he\nslowly added, “By the blood of Christ I swear never to leave you while\nyou live.”\n\nFaria gazed fondly on his noble-minded, single-hearted, high-principled\nyoung friend, and read in his countenance ample confirmation of the\nsincerity of his devotion and the loyalty of his purpose.\n\n“Thanks,” murmured the invalid, extending one hand. “I accept. You may\none of these days reap the reward of your disinterested devotion. But\nas I cannot, and you will not, quit this place, it becomes necessary to\nfill up the excavation beneath the soldier’s gallery; he might, by\nchance, hear the hollow sound of his footsteps, and call the attention\nof his officer to the circumstance. That would bring about a discovery\nwhich would inevitably lead to our being separated. Go, then, and set\nabout this work, in which, unhappily, I can offer you no assistance;\nkeep at it all night, if necessary, and do not return here tomorrow\ntill after the jailer has visited me. I shall have something of the\ngreatest importance to communicate to you.”\n\nDantès took the hand of the abbé in his, and affectionately pressed it.\nFaria smiled encouragingly on him, and the young man retired to his\ntask, in the spirit of obedience and respect which he had sworn to show\ntowards his aged friend.\n\n\n\n Chapter 18. The Treasure\n\nWhen Dantès returned next morning to the chamber of his companion in\ncaptivity, he found Faria seated and looking composed. In the ray of\nlight which entered by the narrow window of his cell, he held open in\nhis left hand, of which alone, it will be recollected, he retained the\nuse, a sheet of paper, which, from being constantly rolled into a small\ncompass, had the form of a cylinder, and was not easily kept open. He\ndid not speak, but showed the paper to Dantès.\n\n“What is that?” he inquired.\n\n“Look at it,” said the abbé with a smile.\n\n“I have looked at it with all possible attention,” said Dantès, “and I\nonly see a half-burnt paper, on which are traces of Gothic characters\ninscribed with a peculiar kind of ink.”\n\n“This paper, my friend,” said Faria, “I may now avow to you, since I\nhave the proof of your fidelity—this paper is my treasure, of which,"}, {"chunk_id": 567, "text": "at he let go the ladder, crying, “Help!” A second blow struck\nhim almost immediately in the side, and he fell, calling, “Help,\nmurder!” Then, as he rolled on the ground, his adversary seized him by\nthe hair, and struck him a third blow in the chest.\n\nThis time Caderousse endeavored to call again, but he could only utter\na groan, and he shuddered as the blood flowed from his three wounds.\nThe assassin, finding that he no longer cried out, lifted his head up\nby the hair; his eyes were closed, and the mouth was distorted. The\nmurderer, supposing him dead, let fall his head and disappeared.\n\nThen Caderousse, feeling that he was leaving him, raised himself on his\nelbow, and with a dying voice cried with great effort:\n\n“Murder! I am dying! Help, reverend sir,—help!”\n\nThis mournful appeal pierced the darkness. The door of the\nback-staircase opened, then the side-gate of the garden, and Ali and\nhis master were on the spot with lights.\n\n\n\n Chapter 83. The Hand of God\n\nCaderousse continued to call piteously, “Help, reverend sir, help!”\n\n“What is the matter?” asked Monte Cristo.\n\n“Help,” cried Caderousse; “I am murdered!”\n\n“We are here;—take courage.”\n\n“Ah, it’s all over! You are come too late—you are come to see me die.\nWhat blows, what blood!”\n\nHe fainted. Ali and his master conveyed the wounded man into a room.\nMonte Cristo motioned to Ali to undress him, and he then examined his\ndreadful wounds.\n\n“My God!” he exclaimed, “thy vengeance is sometimes delayed, but only\nthat it may fall the more effectually.” Ali looked at his master for\nfurther instructions. “Bring here immediately the king’s attorney, M.\nde Villefort, who lives in the Faubourg Saint-Honoré. As you pass the\nlodge, wake the porter, and send him for a surgeon.”\n\nAli obeyed, leaving the abbé alone with Caderousse, who had not yet\nrevived.\n\nWhen the wretched man again opened his eyes, the count looked at him\nwith a mournful expression of pity, and his lips moved as if in prayer.\n“A surgeon, reverend sir—a surgeon!” said Caderousse.\n\n“I have sent for one,” replied the abbé.\n\n“I know he cannot save my life, but he may strengthen me to give my\nevidence.”\n\n“Against whom?”\n\n“Against my murderer.”\n\n“Did you recognize him?”\n\n“Yes; it was Benedetto.”\n\n“The young Corsican?”\n\n“Himself.”\n\n“Your comrade?”\n\n“Yes. After giving me the plan of this house, doubtless hoping I should\nkill the count and he thus become his heir, or that the count would\nkill me and I should be out of his way, he waylaid me, and has murdered\nme.”\n\n“I have also sent for the procureur.”\n\n“He will not come in time; I feel my life fast ebbing.”\n\n“Wait a moment,” said Monte Cristo. He left the room, and returned in\nfive minutes with a phial. The dying man’s eyes were all the time\nriveted on the door, through which he hoped succor would arrive.\n\n“Hasten, reverend sir, hasten! I shall faint again!” Monte Cristo\napproached, and dropped on his purple lips three or four drops of the\ncontents of the phial. Caderousse drew a deep breath. “Oh,” said he,\n“that is life to me; more, more!”\n\n“Two drops more would kill you,” replied the abbé.\n\n“Oh, send for someone to whom I can denounce the wretch!”\n\n“Shall I write your deposition? You can sign it.”\n\n“Yes, yes,” said Caderousse; and his eyes glistened at the thought of\nthis posthumous revenge. Monte Cristo wrote:\n\n“I die, murdered by the Corsican Benedetto, my comrade in the galleys\nat Toulon, No. 59.”\n\n\n“Quick, quick!” said Caderousse, “or I shall be unable to sign it.”\n\nMonte Cristo gave the pen to Caderousse, who collected all his\nstrength, signed it, and fell back on his bed, saying:\n\n“You will relate all the rest, reverend sir; you will say he calls\nhimself Andrea Cavalcanti. He lodges at the Hôtel des Princes. Oh, I am\ndying!” He again fainted. The abbé made him smell the contents of the\nphial, and he again opened his eyes. His desire for revenge had not\nforsaken him.\n\n“Ah, you will tell all I have said, will you not, reverend sir?”\n\n“Yes, and much more.”\n\n“What more will yo"}, {"chunk_id": 313, "text": "grew heavy, deep sleep stole over me, and having\nno suspicion of anything wrong, I sought not to shake it off. I looked\ninto the kitchen once more and saw Caderousse sitting by the side of a\nlong table upon one of the low wooden stools which in country places\nare frequently used instead of chairs; his back was turned towards me,\nso that I could not see the expression of his countenance—neither\nshould I have been able to do so had he been placed differently, as his\nhead was buried between his two hands. La Carconte continued to gaze on\nhim for some time, then shrugging her shoulders, she took her seat\nimmediately opposite to him.\n\n“At this moment the expiring embers threw up a fresh flame from the\nkindling of a piece of wood that lay near, and a bright light flashed\nover the room. La Carconte still kept her eyes fixed on her husband,\nbut as he made no sign of changing his position, she extended her hard,\nbony hand, and touched him on the forehead.\n\n20317m\n\n\n\n“Caderousse shuddered. The woman’s lips seemed to move, as though she\nwere talking; but because she merely spoke in an undertone, or my\nsenses were dulled by sleep, I did not catch a word she uttered.\nConfused sights and sounds seemed to float before me, and gradually I\nfell into a deep, heavy slumber. How long I had been in this\nunconscious state I know not, when I was suddenly aroused by the report\nof a pistol, followed by a fearful cry. Weak and tottering footsteps\nresounded across the chamber above me, and the next instant a dull,\nheavy weight seemed to fall powerless on the staircase. I had not yet\nfully recovered consciousness, when again I heard groans, mingled with\nhalf-stifled cries, as if from persons engaged in a deadly struggle. A\ncry more prolonged than the others and ending in a series of groans\neffectually roused me from my drowsy lethargy. Hastily raising myself\non one arm, I looked around, but all was dark; and it seemed to me as\nif the rain must have penetrated through the flooring of the room\nabove, for some kind of moisture appeared to fall, drop by drop, upon\nmy forehead, and when I passed my hand across my brow, I felt that it\nwas wet and clammy.\n\n“To the fearful noises that had awakened me had succeeded the most\nperfect silence—unbroken, save by the footsteps of a man walking about\nin the chamber above. The staircase creaked, he descended into the room\nbelow, approached the fire and lit a candle.\n\n“The man was Caderousse—he was pale and his shirt was all bloody.\nHaving obtained the light, he hurried upstairs again, and once more I\nheard his rapid and uneasy footsteps.\n\n“A moment later he came down again, holding in his hand the small\nshagreen case, which he opened, to assure himself it contained the\ndiamond,—seemed to hesitate as to which pocket he should put it in,\nthen, as if dissatisfied with the security of either pocket, he\ndeposited it in his red handkerchief, which he carefully rolled round\nhis head.\n\n“After this he took from his cupboard the bank-notes and gold he had\nput there, thrust the one into the pocket of his trousers, and the\nother into that of his waistcoat, hastily tied up a small bundle of\nlinen, and rushing towards the door, disappeared in the darkness of the\nnight.\n\n“Then all became clear and manifest to me, and I reproached myself with\nwhat had happened, as though I myself had done the guilty deed. I\nfancied that I still heard faint moans, and imagining that the\nunfortunate jeweller might not be quite dead, I determined to go to his\nrelief, by way of atoning in some slight degree, not for the crime I\nhad committed, but for that which I had not endeavored to prevent. For\nthis purpose I applied all the strength I possessed to force an\nentrance from the cramped spot in which I lay to the adjoining room.\nThe poorly fastened boards which alone divided me from it yielded to my\nefforts, and I found myself in the house.

What avails\nrecrimination over matters wholly past recall? For my own part, I have\nlaid aside even the name of my father, and altogether disown his\npolitical principles.

Come,\nnow, I have hopes of obtaining what I have been for years endeavoring\nto persuade the marquise to promise; namely, a perfect amnesty and\nforgetfulness of the past.”\n\n“With all my heart,” replied the marquise; “let the past be forever\nforgotten. I promise you it affords _me_ as little pleasure to revive\nit as it does you. All I ask is, that Villefort will be firm and\ninflexible for the future in his political principles. Remember, also,\nVillefort, that we have pledged ourselves to his majesty for your\nfealty and strict loyalty, and that at our recommendation the king\nconsented to forget the past, as I do” (and here she extended to him\nher hand)—“as I now do at your entreaty. But bear in mind, that should\nthere fall in your way anyone guilty of conspiring against the\ngovernment, you will be so much the more bound to visit the offence\nwith rigorous punishment, as it is known you belong to a suspected\nfamily.”\n\n“Alas, madame,” returned Villefort, “my profession, as well as the\ntimes in which we live, compels me to be severe. I have already\nsuccessfully conducted several public prosecutions, and brought the\noffenders to merited punishment. But we have not done with the thing\nyet.”\n\n0087m\n\n\n\n“Do you, indeed, think so?” inquired the marquise.\n\n“I am, at least, fearful of it. Napoleon, in the Island of Elba, is too\nnear France, and his proximity keeps up the hopes of his partisans.\nMarseilles is filled with half-pay officers, who are daily, under one\nfrivolous pretext or other, getting up quarrels with the royalists;\nfrom hence arise continual and fatal duels among the higher classes of\npersons, and assassinations in the lower.”\n\n“You have heard, perhaps,” said the Comte de Salvieux, one of M. de\nSaint-Méran’s oldest friends, and chamberlain to the Comte d’Artois,\n“that the Holy Alliance purpose removing him from thence?”\n\n“Yes; they were talking about it when we left Paris,” said M. de\nSaint-Méran; “and where is it decided to transfer him?”\n\n“To Saint Helena.”\n\n“For heaven’s sake, where is that?” asked the marquise.\n\n“An island situated on the other side of the equator, at least two\nthousand leagues from here,” replied the count.\n\n“So much the better. As Villefort observes, it is a great act of folly\nto have left such a man between Corsica, where he was born, and Naples,\nof which his brother-in-law is king, and face to face with Italy, the\nsovereignty of which he coveted for his son.”\n\n“Unfortunately,” said Villefort, “there are the treaties of 1814, and\nwe cannot molest Napoleon without breaking those compacts.”\n\n“Oh, well, we"}, {"chunk_id": 500, "text": "cted her very deeply, she has not\ncompletely recovered her reason.”\n\n“But of what disease, then, did she die?” asked Debray.\n\n“It is said to have been a congestion of the brain, or apoplexy, which\nis the same thing, is it not?”\n\n“Nearly.”\n\n“It is difficult to believe that it was apoplexy,” said Beauchamp.\n“Madame de Saint-Méran, whom I once saw, was short, of slender form,\nand of a much more nervous than sanguine temperament; grief could\nhardly produce apoplexy in such a constitution as that of Madame de\nSaint-Méran.”\n\n“At any rate,” said Albert, “whatever disease or doctor may have killed\nher, M. de Villefort, or rather, Mademoiselle Valentine,—or, still\nrather, our friend Franz, inherits a magnificent fortune, amounting, I\nbelieve, to 80,000 livres per annum.”\n\n“And this fortune will be doubled at the death of the old Jacobin,\nNoirtier.”\n\n“That is a tenacious old grandfather,” said Beauchamp. “_Tenacem\npropositi virum_. I think he must have made an agreement with death to\noutlive all his heirs, and he appears likely to succeed. He resembles\nthe old Conventionalist of ’93, who said to Napoleon, in 1814, ‘You\nbend because your empire is a young stem, weakened by rapid growth.\nTake the Republic for a tutor; let us return with renewed strength to\nthe battle-field, and I promise you 500,000 soldiers, another Marengo,\nand a second Austerlitz. Ideas do not become extinct, sire; they\nslumber sometimes, but only revive the stronger before they sleep\nentirely.’”\n\n“Ideas and men appeared the same to him,” said Albert. “One thing only\npuzzles me, namely, how Franz d’Épinay will like a grandfather who\ncannot be separated from his wife. But where is Franz?”\n\n“In the first carriage, with M. de Villefort, who considers him already\nas one of the family.”\n\n40024m\n\n\n\nSuch was the conversation in almost all the carriages; these two sudden\ndeaths, so quickly following each other, astonished everyone, but no\none suspected the terrible secret which M. d’Avrigny had communicated,\nin his nocturnal walk to M. de Villefort. They arrived in about an hour\nat the cemetery; the weather was mild, but dull, and in harmony with\nthe funeral ceremony. Among the groups which flocked towards the family\nvault, Château-Renaud recognized Morrel, who had come alone in a\ncabriolet, and walked silently along the path bordered with yew-trees.\n\n“You here?” said Château-Renaud, passing his arms through the young\ncaptain’s; “are you a friend of Villefort’s? How is it that I have\nnever met you at his house?”\n\n“I am no acquaintance of M. de Villefort’s,” answered Morrel, “but I\nwas of Madame de Saint-Méran.” Albert came up to them at this moment\nwith Franz.\n\n“The time and place are but ill-suited for an introduction.” said\nAlbert; “but we are not superstitious. M. Morrel, allow me to present\nto you M. Franz d’Épinay, a delightful travelling companion, with whom\nI made the tour of Italy. My dear Franz, M. Maximilian Morrel, an\nexcellent friend I have acquired in your absence, and whose name you\nwill hear me mention every time I make any allusion to affection, wit,\nor amiability.”\n\nMorrel hesitated for a moment; he feared it would be hypocritical to\naccost in a friendly manner the man whom he was tacitly opposing, but\nhis oath and the gravity of the circumstances recurred to his memory;\nhe struggled to conceal his emotion and bowed to Franz.\n\n“Mademoiselle de Villefort is in deep sorrow, is she not?” said Debray\nto Franz.\n\n“Extremely,” replied he; “she looked so pale this morning, I scarcely\nknew her.”\n\nThese apparently simple words pierced Morrel to the heart. This man had\nseen Valentine, and spoken to her! The young and high-spirited officer\nrequired all his strength of mind to resist breaking his oath. He took\nthe arm of Château-Renaud, and turned towards the vault, where the\nattendants had already placed the two coffins.\n\n“This is a magnificent habitation,” said Beauchamp, looking towards the\nmausoleum; “a summer and winter palace. You will, in turn, enter it, my\ndear d’É"}, {"chunk_id": 62, "text": " boy,” continued Noirtier, “I rely on your prudence to\nremove all the things which I leave in your care.”\n\n“Oh, rely on me,” said Villefort.\n\n“Yes, yes; and now I believe you are right, and that you have really\nsaved my life; be assured I will return the favor hereafter.”\n\nVillefort shook his head.\n\n“You are not convinced yet?”\n\n“I hope at least, that you may be mistaken.”\n\n“Shall you see the king again?”\n\n“Perhaps.”\n\n“Would you pass in his eyes for a prophet?”\n\n“Prophets of evil are not in favor at the court, father.”\n\n“True, but some day they do them justice; and supposing a second\nrestoration, you would then pass for a great man.”\n\n“Well, what should I say to the king?”\n\n“Say this to him: ‘Sire, you are deceived as to the feeling in France,\nas to the opinions of the towns, and the prejudices of the army; he\nwhom in Paris you call the Corsican ogre, who at Nevers is styled the\nusurper, is already saluted as Bonaparte at Lyons, and emperor at\nGrenoble. You think he is tracked, pursued, captured; he is advancing\nas rapidly as his own eagles. The soldiers you believe to be dying with\nhunger, worn out with fatigue, ready to desert, gather like atoms of\nsnow about the rolling ball as it hastens onward. Sire, go, leave\nFrance to its real master, to him who acquired it, not by purchase, but\nby right of conquest; go, sire, not that you incur any risk, for your\nadversary is powerful enough to show you mercy, but because it would be\nhumiliating for a grandson of Saint Louis to owe his life to the man of\nArcola, Marengo, Austerlitz.’ Tell him this, Gérard; or, rather, tell\nhim nothing. Keep your journey a secret; do not boast of what you have\ncome to Paris to do, or have done; return with all speed; enter\nMarseilles at night, and your house by the back-door, and there remain,\nquiet, submissive, secret, and, above all, inoffensive; for this time,\nI swear to you, we shall act like powerful men who know their enemies.\nGo, my son—go, my dear Gérard, and by your obedience to my paternal\norders, or, if you prefer it, friendly counsels, we will keep you in\nyour place. This will be,” added Noirtier, with a smile, “one means by\nwhich you may a second time save me, if the political balance should\nsome day take another turn, and cast you aloft while hurling me down.\nAdieu, my dear Gérard, and at your next journey alight at my door.”\n\nNoirtier left the room when he had finished, with the same calmness\nthat had characterized him during the whole of this remarkable and\ntrying conversation. Villefort, pale and agitated, ran to the window,\nput aside the curtain, and saw him pass, cool and collected, by two or\nthree ill-looking men at the corner of the street, who were there,\nperhaps, to arrest a man with black whiskers, and a blue frock-coat,\nand hat with broad brim.\n\nVillefort stood watching, breathless, until his father had disappeared\nat the Rue Bussy. Then he turned to the various articles he had left\nbehind him, put the black cravat and blue frock-coat at the bottom of\nthe portmanteau, threw the hat into a dark closet, broke the cane into\nsmall bits and flung it in the fire, put on his travelling-cap, and\ncalling his valet, checked with a look the thousand questions he was\nready to ask, paid his bill, sprang into his carriage, which was ready,\nlearned at Lyons that Bonaparte had entered Grenoble, and in the midst\nof the tumult which prevailed along the road, at length reached\nMarseilles, a prey to all the hopes and fears which enter into the\nheart of man with ambition and its first successes.\n\n\n\n Chapter 13. The Hundred Days\n\nM. Noirtier was a true prophet, and things progressed rapidly, as he\nhad predicted. Everyone knows the history of the famous return from\nElba, a return which was unprecedented in the past, and will probably\nremain without a counterpart in the future.\n\nLouis XVIII. made but a faint attempt to parry this unexpected blow;\nthe monarchy he had scarcely reconstructed tottered on its precarious\nfoundation, and at a sign from the em"}, {"chunk_id": 670, "text": "was nothing more than a beautiful piece of\ncambric, which the young girl had bought a fortnight before.\n\nDuring the evening two men, engaged for the purpose, had carried\nNoirtier from Valentine’s room into his own, and contrary to all\nexpectation there was no difficulty in withdrawing him from his child.\nThe Abbé Busoni had watched till daylight, and then left without\ncalling anyone. D’Avrigny returned about eight o’clock in the morning;\nhe met Villefort on his way to Noirtier’s room, and accompanied him to\nsee how the old man had slept. They found him in the large armchair,\nwhich served him for a bed, enjoying a calm, nay, almost a smiling\nsleep. They both stood in amazement at the door.\n\n“See,” said d’Avrigny to Villefort, “nature knows how to alleviate the\ndeepest sorrow. No one can say that M. Noirtier did not love his child,\nand yet he sleeps.”\n\n“Yes, you are right,” replied Villefort, surprised; “he sleeps, indeed!\nAnd this is the more strange, since the least contradiction keeps him\nawake all night.”\n\n“Grief has stunned him,” replied d’Avrigny; and they both returned\nthoughtfully to the procureur’s study.\n\n“See, I have not slept,” said Villefort, showing his undisturbed bed;\n“grief does not stun me. I have not been in bed for two nights; but\nthen look at my desk; see what I have written during these two days and\nnights. I have filled those papers, and have made out the accusation\nagainst the assassin Benedetto. Oh, work, work,—my passion, my joy, my\ndelight,—it is for thee to alleviate my sorrows!” and he convulsively\ngrasped the hand of d’Avrigny.\n\n“Do you require my services now?” asked d’Avrigny.\n\n“No,” said Villefort; “only return again at eleven o’clock; at twelve\nthe—the—oh, Heavens, my poor, poor child!” and the procureur again\nbecoming a man, lifted up his eyes and groaned.\n\n“Shall you be present in the reception-room?”\n\n“No; I have a cousin who has undertaken this sad office. I shall work,\ndoctor—when I work I forget everything.”\n\nAnd, indeed, no sooner had the doctor left the room, than he was again\nabsorbed in work. On the doorsteps d’Avrigny met the cousin whom\nVillefort had mentioned, a personage as insignificant in our story as\nin the world he occupied—one of those beings designed from their birth\nto make themselves useful to others. He was punctual, dressed in black,\nwith crape around his hat, and presented himself at his cousin’s with a\nface made up for the occasion, and which he could alter as might be\nrequired.\n\nAt eleven o’clock the mourning-coaches rolled into the paved court, and\nthe Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré was filled with a crowd of idlers,\nequally pleased to witness the festivities or the mourning of the rich,\nand who rush with the same avidity to a funeral procession as to the\nmarriage of a duchess.\n\nGradually the reception-room filled, and some of our old friends made\ntheir appearance—we mean Debray, Château-Renaud, and Beauchamp,\naccompanied by all the leading men of the day at the bar, in\nliterature, or the army, for M. de Villefort moved in the first\nParisian circles, less owing to his social position than to his\npersonal merit.\n\nThe cousin standing at the door ushered in the guests, and it was\nrather a relief to the indifferent to see a person as unmoved as\nthemselves, and who did not exact a mournful face or force tears, as\nwould have been the case with a father, a brother, or a lover. Those\nwho were acquainted soon formed into little groups. One of them was\nmade of Debray, Château-Renaud, and Beauchamp.\n\n“Poor girl,” said Debray, like the rest, paying an involuntary tribute\nto the sad event,—“poor girl, so young, so rich, so beautiful! Could\nyou have imagined this scene, Château-Renaud, when we saw her, at the\nmost three weeks ago, about to sign that contract?”\n\n“Indeed, no,” said Château-Renaud.”\n\n“Did you know her?”\n\n“I spoke to her once or twice at Madame de Morcerf’s, among the rest;\nshe appeared to me charming, though rather melancholy. Where is her\nstepmother? Do you know?”\n\n“Sh"}, {"chunk_id": 458, "text": "6,000 francs. I would have given\n10,000—I would have given 20,000. I had the money with me; I made the\ntenant sign the deed of resilition, and when I had obtained what I so\nmuch wanted, I galloped to Auteuil. No one had entered the house since\nI had left it.\n\n“It was five o’clock in the afternoon; I ascended into the red room,\nand waited for night. There all the thoughts which had disturbed me\nduring my year of constant agony came back with double force. The\nCorsican, who had declared the vendetta against me, who had followed me\nfrom Nîmes to Paris, who had hid himself in the garden, who had struck\nme, had seen me dig the grave, had seen me inter the child,—he might\nbecome acquainted with your person,—nay, he might even then have known\nit. Would he not one day make you pay for keeping this terrible secret?\nWould it not be a sweet revenge for him when he found that I had not\ndied from the blow of his dagger? It was therefore necessary, before\neverything else, and at all risks, that I should cause all traces of\nthe past to disappear—that I should destroy every material vestige; too\nmuch reality would always remain in my recollection. It was for this I\nhad annulled the lease—it was for this I had come—it was for this I was\nwaiting.\n\n“Night arrived; I allowed it to become quite dark. I was without a\nlight in that room; when the wind shook all the doors, behind which I\ncontinually expected to see some spy concealed, I trembled. I seemed\neverywhere to hear your moans behind me in the bed, and I dared not\nturn around. My heart beat so violently that I feared my wound would\nopen. At length, one by one, all the noises in the neighborhood ceased.\nI understood that I had nothing to fear, that I should neither be seen\nnor heard, so I decided upon descending to the garden.\n\n“Listen, Hermine; I consider myself as brave as most men, but when I\ndrew from my breast the little key of the staircase, which I had found\nin my coat—that little key we both used to cherish so much, which you\nwished to have fastened to a golden ring—when I opened the door, and\nsaw the pale moon shedding a long stream of white light on the spiral\nstaircase like a spectre, I leaned against the wall, and nearly\nshrieked. I seemed to be going mad. At last I mastered my agitation. I\ndescended the staircase step by step; the only thing I could not\nconquer was a strange trembling in my knees. I grasped the railings; if\nI had relaxed my hold for a moment, I should have fallen. I reached the\nlower door. Outside this door a spade was placed against the wall; I\ntook it, and advanced towards the thicket. I had provided myself with a\ndark lantern. In the middle of the lawn I stopped to light it, then I\ncontinued my path.\n\n“It was the end of November, all the verdure of the garden had\ndisappeared, the trees were nothing more than skeletons with their long\nbony arms, and the dead leaves sounded on the gravel under my feet. My\nterror overcame me to such a degree as I approached the thicket, that I\ntook a pistol from my pocket and armed myself. I fancied continually\nthat I saw the figure of the Corsican between the branches. I examined\nthe thicket with my dark lantern; it was empty. I looked carefully\naround; I was indeed alone,—no noise disturbed the silence but the owl,\nwhose piercing cry seemed to be calling up the phantoms of the night. I\ntied my lantern to a forked branch I had noticed a year before at the\nprecise spot where I stopped to dig the hole.\n\n“The grass had grown very thickly there during the summer, and when\nautumn arrived no one had been there to mow it. Still one place where\nthe grass was thin attracted my attention; it evidently was there I had\nturned up the ground. I went to work. The hour, then, for which I had\nbeen waiting during the last year had at length arrived. How I worked,\nhow I hoped, how I struck every piece of turf, thinking to find some\nresistance to my spade!

They worked vigorously, and the boat ascended the\ncurrent of the Waikato with remarkable swiftness.\n\nIn the centre of this long canoe, with feet tied, but hands free, were\nten European prisoners clinging closely to each other. They were Lord\nGlenarvan and his companions.\n\n[Sidenote: A TESTING TIME.]\n\nThe evening before, the little party, led astray by the dense fog, had\nencamped in the midst of a numerous tribe of natives. About midnight,\nthe travelers, surprised in their sleep, were made prisoners and\ncarried on board the canoe. They had not yet been maltreated, but had\ntried in vain to resist. Their arms and ammunition were in the hands of\nthe savages, and their own bullets would have quickly stretched them on\nthe earth had they attempted to escape.\n\nThey were not long in learning, by the aid of a few English words which\nthe natives used, that, being driven back by the British troops, they\nwere returning, vanquished and weakened, to the regions of the upper\nWaikato. Their chief, after an obstinate resistance, in which he lost\nhis principal warriors, was now on his way to rouse again the river\ntribes. He was called Kai-Koumou, a terrible name, which signified\nin the native language \"he who eats the limbs of his enemy.\" He was\nbrave and bold, but his cruelty equaled his bravery. No pity could be\nexpected from him. His name was well known to the English soldiers, and\na price had been set upon his head by the governor of New Zealand.\n\nThis terrible catastrophe had come upon Glenarvan just as he was\nabout reaching the long-desired harbor of Auckland, whence he would\nhave returned to his native country. Yet, looking at his calm and\npassionless countenance, you could not have divined the depth of his\nanguish, for in his present critical situation he did not betray the\nextent of his misfortunes. He felt that he ought to set an example of\nfortitude to his wife and his companions, as being the husband and\nchief. Moreover, he was ready to die first for the common safety, if\ncircumstances should require it.\n\n[Sidenote: CHIEFS, CIVILIZED AND UNCIVILIZED.]\n\nHis companions were worthy of him; they shared his noble thoughts, and\ntheir calm and haughty appearance would scarcely have intimated that\nthey were being carried away to captivity and suffering. By common\nconsent, at Glenarvan's suggestion, they had resolved to feign a proud\nindifference in the presence of the savages. It was the only way of\ninfluencing those fierce natures.\n\n[Illustration: A boat might have been seen ascending the Waikato. It\nwas a canoe seventy feet long and five broad.]\n\nSince leaving the encampment, the natives, taciturn like all savages,\nhad scarcely spoken to each other. However, from a few words exchanged,\nGlenarvan perceived that they were acquainted with the English\nlanguage. He therefore resolved to question the chief in regard to the\nfate that was in store for them. Addressing Kai-Koumou, he said, in a\nfearless tone:\n\n\"Where are you taking us, chief?\"\n\nKai-Koumou gazed at him coldly without answering.\n\n\"Say, what do you expect to do with us?\" continued Glenarvan.\n\nThe chief's eyes blazed with a sudden light, and in a stern voice he\nreplied:\n\n\"To exchange you, if your friends will ransom you; to kill you, if they\nrefuse.\"\n\nGlenarvan asked no more, but hope returned to his heart. Doubtless,\nsome chiefs of the Maori tribe had fallen into the hands of the\nEnglish, and the natives would attempt to recover them by way of\nexchange; their situation, therefore, was not one for despair.\n\nMeantime the canoe rapidly ascended the river. Paganel, whose\nchangeable disposition carried him from one extreme to another, had\nregained his hopefulness.

On one occasion so certain was Paganel as to the ease with\nwhich they would be able to pursue their search, when they arrived,\nthat he asserted that more than fifty geographers had already made the\ncourse clear for them.\n\n\"What! fifty, do you say?\" asked the major, with an air of doubt.\n\n\"Yes, MacNabb, decidedly,\" said the geographer, piqued at the hesitancy\nto believe him.\n\n\"Impossible!\" replied the major.\n\n\"Not at all; and if you doubt my veracity, I will cite their names.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said the major, quietly, \"you clever people stick at nothing.\"\n\n\"Major,\" said Paganel, \"will you wager your rifle against my telescope\nthat I cannot name at least fifty Australian explorers?\"\n\n\"Of course, Paganel, if you like,\" replied MacNabb, seeing that he\ncould not now recede from his position without incurring the ridicule\nof the company.\n\n[Illustration: \"Major,\" said Paganel, \"will you wager your rifle\nagainst my telescope that I cannot name at least fifty Australian\nexplorers?\"]\n\n[Illustration: \"Master Robert shall count for us.\" And forthwith the\nlearned geographer opened his budget, and poured forth the history of\nthe discovery of Australia.]\n\n\"Well, then,\" said Paganel to Lady Helena and Miss Grant, \"come and\nbe umpires, and Master Robert shall count for us.\" And forthwith the\nlearned geographer opened his budget, and poured forth the history of\nthe discovery of Australia, with the names of its discoverers and the\ndates of their explorations, as fluently as though his sole calling in\nlife was to be professor of Australian history. Rapidly he mentioned\nthe first twenty who found or traversed the Austral shores; as rapidly\ndid the names of the second score flow from his lips; and after the\nprescribed fifty had been enumerated, he kept on as though his list\nwere inexhaustible.\n\n\"Enough, enough, Monsieur Paganel!\" said Lady Helena. \"You have shown\nthat there is nothing, great or small, about Australia, of which you\nare ignorant.\"\n\n\"Nay, madam,\" said the geographer, with a bow.\n\nThen, with a peculiar expression, he smiled as he said to the major,\n\"We will talk about the rifle at another time.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX.\n\nTHE STORM ON THE INDIAN OCEAN.\n\n\nTwo days after this conversation, Captain Mangles took an observation,\nand the passengers saw, to their great satisfaction, upon consulting\nthe map, that they were in the vicinity of Cape Bernouilli, which\nthey might expect to reach in four days. The west wind had hitherto\nfavored the progress of the yacht, but for several days it had shown a\ntendency to fail, and now there was a perfect calm. The sails flapped\nidly against the masts, and had it not been for her powerful screw, the\nDuncan would have been becalmed on the ocean.\n\n[Sidenote: FOREBODINGS OF DISASTER.]\n\nThis state of things might be prolonged indefinitely. At evening\nGlenarvan consulted the captain on the subject. The latter, whose\nsupply of coal was rapidly diminishing, appeared much disturbed at the\nsubsidence of the wind. He had covered his ship with canvas, and set\nhis studding- and main-sails, that he might take advantage of the least\nbreeze; but, in nautical language, there was not enough wind \"to fill a\nhat.\"\n\n\"At all events,\" said Glenarvan, \"we need not complain. It is better to\nbe without wind than to have a contrary one.\"\n\n\"Your lordship is right,\" replied Captain Mangles; \"but I dread some\nsudden change in the weather. We are now in the neighborhood of the\ntrade-winds, which, from October to April, blow from the northeast, and\nour progress will, therefore, be very much retarded.\"\n\n\"But what can we do, captain? If this misfortune occurs, we must submit\nto it. It will only be a delay, after all.\"\n\n\"Probably, if a storm does not come upon us too.\"\n\n\"Do y"}, {"chunk_id": 202, "text": "d in on all sides.\n\n\"Let us go down,\" cried he, \"before our only way of escape is blocked\nup.\"\n\nBut just as the ladies rose by a final effort, MacNabb stopped them,\nand said:\n\n\"It is useless, Glenarvan. Look!\"\n\nAnd all saw, indeed, that an inexplicable change had taken place in the\nmovements of the Maoris. Their pursuit had been suddenly interrupted.\nTheir ascent of the mountain had ceased, as if by an imperious\ninterdict. The crowd of natives had checked their swiftness, and\nhalted, like the waves of the sea before an impassable rock.\n\nAll the savages, thirsting for blood, were now ranged along the foot\nof the mountain, yelling, gesticulating, and brandishing guns and\nhatchets; but they did not advance a single foot. Their dogs, like\nthemselves, as though chained to earth, howled with rage.\n\nWhat was the difficulty? What invisible power restrained the natives?\nThe fugitives gazed without comprehending, fearing that the charm that\nenchained Kai-Koumou's tribe would dissolve.\n\nSuddenly Captain Mangles uttered a cry that caused his companions to\nturn. He pointed to a little fortress at the summit of the peak.\n\n\"The tomb of the chief Kara-Tété!\" cried Robert.\n\n\"Are you in earnest?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"Yes, my lord, it is the tomb; I recognize it.\"\n\nRobert was right. Fifty feet above, at the extreme point of the\nmountain, stood a small palisaded inclosure of freshly-painted stakes.\nGlenarvan, likewise, recognized the sepulchre of the Maori chief. In\ntheir wanderings they had come to the top of the Maunganamu, where\nKara-Tété had been buried.\n\nFollowed by his companions, he climbed the sides of the peak, to the\nvery foot of the tomb. A large opening, covered with mats, formed the\nentrance. Glenarvan was about to enter, when, all at once, he started\nback suddenly.\n\n\"A savage!\" said he.\n\n\"A savage in this tomb?\" inquired the major.\n\n\"Yes, MacNabb.\"\n\n\"What matter? Let us enter.\"\n\nGlenarvan, the major, Robert, and Captain Mangles passed into the\ninclosure. A Maori was there, clad in a great flax mantle. The darkness\nof the sepulchre did not permit them to distinguish his features. He\nappeared very calm, and was eating his breakfast with the most perfect\nindifference.\n\nGlenarvan was about to address him, when the native, anticipating him,\nsaid, in an amiable tone, and in excellent English:\n\n\"Be seated, my dear lord; breakfast is awaiting you.\"\n\nIt was Paganel. At his voice all rushed into the tomb, and gazed with\nwonder at the worthy geographer. Paganel was found! The common safety\nwas represented in him. They were going to question him: they wished\nto know how and why he was on the top of the mountain; but Glenarvan\nchecked this unseasonable curiosity.\n\n[Illustration: \"Be seated, my dear lord; breakfast is awaiting you.\"]\n\n\"The savages!\" said he.\n\n\"The savages,\" replied Paganel, shrugging his shoulders, \"are\nindividuals whom I supremely despise.\"\n\n\"But can they not----?\"\n\n\"They! the imbeciles! Come and see them.\"\n\nEach followed Paganel, who issued from the tomb. The Maoris were in the\nsame place, surrounding the foot of the peak, and uttering terrible\ncries.\n\n\"Cry and howl till you are tired, miserable creatures!\" said Paganel.\n\"I defy you to climb this mountain!\"\n\n\"And why?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"Because the chief is buried here; this tomb protects us, and the\nmountain is tabooed.\"\n\n\"Tabooed?\"\n\n\"Yes, my friends; and that is why I took refuge here, as in one of\nthose asylums of the Middle Ages, open to unfortunates.\"\n\nIndeed, the mountain was tabooed, and by this consecration had become\ninaccessible by the superstitious savages.\n\nThe safety of the fugitives was not yet certain, but there was a\nsalutary respite, of which they strove to take advantage. Glenarvan, a\nprey to unspeakable emotion, did not venture a word; while the major\nnodded his head with an air of genuine satisfaction.\n\n\"And now, my friends,\" said Paganel, \"if these brutes expect us to test\ntheir patience they are mistaken. In two days we shall be beyond the\nreach of these ra"}, {"chunk_id": 187, "text": "re, but hope returned to his heart. Doubtless,\nsome chiefs of the Maori tribe had fallen into the hands of the\nEnglish, and the natives would attempt to recover them by way of\nexchange; their situation, therefore, was not one for despair.\n\nMeantime the canoe rapidly ascended the river. Paganel, whose\nchangeable disposition carried him from one extreme to another, had\nregained his hopefulness. He believed that the Maoris were sparing them\nthe fatigue of their journey to the English settlements, and that they\nwere certain to arrive at their destination. He was, therefore, quite\nresigned to his lot, and traced on his map the course of the Waikato\nacross the plains and valleys of the province. Lady Helena and Mary\nGrant, suppressing their terror, conversed in low tones with Glenarvan,\nand the most skillful physiognomist could not have detected on their\nfaces the anxiety of their hearts.\n\nThe Waikato River is worshiped by the natives, as Paganel knew, and\nEnglish and German naturalists have never ascended beyond its junction\nwith the Waipa. Whither did Kai-Koumou intend to take his captives?\nThe geographer could not have guessed if the word \"Taupo,\" frequently\nrepeated, had not attracted his attention. By consulting his map,\nhe saw that this name was applied to a celebrated lake in the most\nmountainous part of the island, and that from it the Waikato flows.\n\nPaganel, addressing Captain Mangles in French, so as not to be\nunderstood by the savages, asked him how fast the canoe was going. The\ncaptain thought about three miles an hour.\n\n\"Then,\" replied the geographer, \"if we do not travel during the night,\nour voyage to the lake will last about four days.\"\n\n\"But whereabouts are the English garrisons?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"It is difficult to say,\" replied Paganel. \"At all events, the war\nmust have reached the province of Taranaki, and probably the troops\nare collected beyond the mountains, on the side of the lake where the\nhabitations of the savages are concentrated.\"\n\n\"God grant it!\" said Lady Helena.\n\nGlenarvan cast a sorrowful glance at his young wife and Mary Grant,\nexposed to the mercy of these fierce natives, and captives in a wild\ncountry, far from all human assistance. But he saw that he was watched\nby Kai-Koumou, and, not wishing to show that one of the captives was\nhis wife, he prudently kept his thoughts to himself, and gazed at the\nbanks of the river with apparent indifference.\n\n[Sidenote: ACCESSIONS, AND PROGRESS.]\n\nThe sun was just sinking below the horizon as the canoe ran upon a bank\nof pumice-stones, which the Waikato carries with it from its source\nin the volcanic mountains. Several trees grew here, as if designed to\nshelter an encampment. Kai-Koumou landed his prisoners.\n\nThe men had their hands tied, the ladies were free. All were placed\nin the centre of the encampment, around which large fires formed an\nimpassable barrier.\n\nBefore Kai-Koumou had informed his captives of his intention to\nexchange them, Glenarvan and Captain Mangles had discussed various\nmethods of recovering their liberty. What they could not venture in the\nboat they hoped to attempt on land, at the hour for encamping, under\ncover of the night.\n\nBut since Glenarvan's conversation with the chief, it seemed wise to\nabandon this design. They must be patient. It was the most prudent\nplan. The exchange offered chances that neither an open attack nor a\nflight across these unknown regions could afford. Many circumstances\nmight indeed arise that would delay, and even prevent, such a\ntransaction; but still it was better to await the result. What,\nmoreover, could ten defenceless men do against thirty well-armed\nsavages? Besides, Glenarvan thought it likely that Kai-Koumou's tribe\nhad lost some chief of high rank whom they were particularly anxious to\nrecover; and he was not mistaken.\n\nThe next day the canoe ascended the river with increased swiftness.\nIt stopped for a moment at the junction of a small river which wound\nacross the plains on the right bank.

Salt springs, of a singular\ntransparency, teeming with myriads of insects, issued from the porous\nground. They exhaled a penetrating odor, and deposited on the earth a\nwhite coating like dazzling snow. Their waters, though clear, were\nat the boiling-point, while other neighboring springs poured forth\nice-cold streams. On every side water-spouts, with spiral rings of\nvapor, spirted from the ground like the jets of a fountain, some\ncontinuous, others intermittent, as if controlled by some capricious\nsprite. They rose like an amphitheatre, in natural terraces one above\nanother, their vapors gradually mingling in wreaths of white smoke; and\nflowing down the semi-transparent steps of these gigantic staircases,\nthey fed the lakes with their boiling cascades.\n\nIt will be needless to dilate upon the incidents of the journey, which\nwere neither numerous nor important. Their way led through forests and\nover plains. The captain took his bearings by the sun and stars. The\nsky, which was quite clear, was sparing of heat and rain. Still, an\nincreasing weariness delayed the travelers, already so cruelly tried,\nand they had to make great efforts to reach their destination.\n\nHowever, they still conversed together, but no longer in common. The\nlittle party was divided into groups, not by any narrow prejudice or\nill feeling, but to some extent from sadness. Often Glenarvan was\nalone, thinking, as he approached the coast, of the Duncan and her\ncrew. He forgot the dangers that still threatened him, in his grief for\nhis lost sailors and the terrible visions that continually haunted his\nmind.\n\nThey no longer spoke of Harry Grant. And why should they, since they\ncould do nothing for him? If the captain's name was ever pronounced, it\nwas in the conversations of his daughter and her betrothed. The young\ncaptain had not reminded her of what she had said to him on the last\nnight of their captivity on the mountain. His magnanimity would not\ntake advantage of words uttered in a moment of supreme despair.\n\n[Sidenote: ACCOMPLISHING THE LAST STAGE.]\n\nWhen he did speak of Captain Grant, he began to lay plans for a further\nsearch. He declared to Mary that Lord Glenarvan would resume this\nundertaking, hitherto so unsuccessful.\n\n[Illustration: On every side water-spouts, with spiral rings of vapor,\nspirted from the ground like the jets of a fountain.]\n\nHe maintained that the authenticity of the document could not be\ndoubted. Her father must, therefore, be somewhere; and though it were\nnecessary to search the whole world, they were sure to find him. The\nyoung girl was cheered by these words; and both, bound by the same\nthoughts, now sympathized in the same hope. Lady Helena often took part\nin the conversation, and was very careful not to discourage the young\npeople with any sad forebodings.\n\nGlenarvan and his companions, after many vicissitudes, reached the foot\nof Mount Ikirangi, whose peak towered five thousand feet aloft. They\nhad now traveled almost one hundred miles since leaving the Maunganamu,\nand the coast was still thirty miles distant. Captain Mangles had\nhoped to make the journey in ten days, but he was ignorant then of\nthe difficulties of the way. There were still two good days of travel\nbefore they could gain the ocean, and renewed activity and extreme\nvigilance became necessary, for they were entering a region frequented\nby the natives.

The Duncan, after so many hours of peril, was now in a sort\nof creek sheltered by a high promontory from the fury of the wind.\n\nLord Glenarvan shook the hand of the young captain, saying,--\n\n\"Thanks, John!\"\n\nAnd Captain Mangles felt himself fully rewarded by these simple words.\nGlenarvan kept to himself the secret of his anguish, and neither Lady\nHelena, Mary Grant, nor Robert suspected the magnitude of the perils\nthey had just escaped.\n\nOne important point remained to be settled. On what part of the\ncoast had the Duncan been cast by the storm? How could she regain\nher prescribed course? How far were they from Cape Bernouilli? Such\nwere the first questions addressed to the captain, who at once took\nhis bearings and noted his observations on the map. The Duncan had\nnot deviated very far from her route. She was at Cape Catastrophe, on\nthe southern coast of Australia, not three hundred miles from Cape\nBernouilli.\n\nBut could the Duncan's injuries be repaired? This was the question to\ndecide. The captain wished to know the extent of the damage. It was\ndiscovered, by diving, that a flange of the screw was bent and came\nin contact with the stern-post. Hence it was impossible for the screw\nto rotate. This injury was considered serious enough to necessitate\ngoing into dry-dock, which of course could not be done in their present\nlocality.\n\nGlenarvan and the captain, after mature reflection, resolved that\nthe Duncan should follow the western shore, seeking traces of the\nBritannia, should stop at Cape Bernouilli, where further information\ncould be obtained, and then continue southward to Melbourne, where her\ninjuries could be repaired; and, as soon as this was done, that she\nshould cruise along the eastern shores to finish the search.\n\nThis arrangement was approved, and Captain Mangles resolved to take\nadvantage of the first favorable wind. He did not have to wait long.\nTowards evening the hurricane had entirely subsided, and a moderate\nbreeze was blowing from the southwest. Preparations were made for\ngetting under way; new sails were set, and at four o'clock in the\nmorning the sailors heaved at the capstan, the anchor was weighed, and\nthe Duncan, with all sails set, cruised close to windward along the\ncoast.\n\nThey arrived at Cape Bernouilli without finding the least trace of the\nlost vessel. But this failure proved nothing. Indeed, during the two\nyears since the shipwreck, the sea might have scattered or destroyed\nthe fragments of the brig. Besides, the natives, who scent shipwrecks\nas a vulture does a corpse, might have carried away every vestige of\nit. Harry Grant and his two companions, therefore, without doubt, had\nbeen taken prisoners the moment the waves cast them ashore, and been\ncarried into the interior of the country.\n\n[Sidenote: HOPING AGAINST HOPE.]\n\nBut here one of Paganel's ingenious suppositions failed. So long as\nthey were in the Argentine territory, the geographer could rightly\nmaintain that the latitude of the document referred to the place of\ncaptivity,--not to the scene of the shipwreck. Indeed, the great rivers\nof the Pampas and their numerous affluents could easily bear the\ndocument to the sea. In this part of Australia, on the contrary, few\nstreams cross the thirty-seventh parallel, and the principal Australian\nrivers--the Murray, the Yara, the Torrens, and the Darling--either flow\ninto each other, or empty into the ocean by"}, {"chunk_id": 190, "text": "des,\nfifteen feet high. A second line of stakes, and then a fence of osiers,\npierced with loop-holes, inclosed the inner space, the court-yard of\nthe pah, in which stood several Maori tents, and forty huts which were\nsymmetrically arranged.\n\nOn their arrival, the captives were terribly impressed at sight of\nthe heads that ornamented the stakes of the second inclosure. Lady\nHelena and Mary Grant turned away their eyes with more of disgust than\nterror. These heads had most of them belonged to hostile chiefs, fallen\nin battle, whose bodies had served as food for the conquerors. The\ngeographer knew them to be such by their hollow and eyeless sockets!\n\nIn Kai-Koumou's pah only the heads of his enemies formed this frightful\nmuseum; and here, doubtless, more than one English skull had served to\nincrease the size of the chief's collection.\n\nHis hut, among those belonging to warriors of lower rank, stood at the\nrear of the pah, in front of a large open terrace. This structure was\nbuilt of stakes, interlaced with branches, and lined inside with flax\nmatting.\n\nOnly one opening gave access to the dwelling. A thick curtain, made\nof a vegetable tissue, served as a door. The roof projected so as to\nform a water-shed. Several faces, carved at the ends of the rafters,\nadorned the hut, and the curtain was covered with various imitations\nof foliage, symbolical figures, monsters, and graceful sculpturing,\na curious piece of work, fashioned by the scissors of the native\ndecorators.\n\n[Sidenote: FEMININE ORATORY.]\n\nInside of the habitation the floor was made of hard-trodden earth,\nand raised six inches above the ground. Several rush screens and some\nmattresses, covered with woven matting of long leaves and twigs,\nserved as beds. In the middle of the room a hole in a stone formed the\nfireplace, and another in the roof answered for a chimney.\n\nThe smoke, when it became sufficiently thick, perforce escaped at this\noutlet, but it of course blackened the walls of the house.\n\nOn one side of the hut were storehouses, containing the chief's\nprovisions, his harvest of flax, potatoes, and edible ferns, and\nthe ovens where the various articles of food were cooked by contact\nwith heated stones. Farther off, in small pens, pigs and goats were\nconfined, and dogs ran about seeking their scanty sustenance. They were\nrather poorly kept, for animals that formed the Maori daily food.\n\nGlenarvan and his companions had taken in the whole at a glance. They\nawaited beside an empty hut the good pleasure of the chief, exposed to\nthe insults of a crowd of old women, who surrounded them like harpies,\nand threatened them with their fists, crying and howling. Several\nEnglish words that passed their lips clearly indicated that they were\ndemanding immediate vengeance.\n\nIn the midst of these cries and threats, Lady Helena affected a\ncalmness that she could not feel in her heart. This courageous woman,\nin order that her husband's coolness might not forsake him, heroically\ncontrolled her emotions. Poor Mary Grant felt herself growing weak, and\nCaptain Mangles supported her, ready to die in her defence. The others\nendured this torrent of invectives in various ways, either indifferent\nlike the major, or increasingly annoyed like Paganel.\n\nGlenarvan, wishing to relieve Lady Helena from the assaults of these\nshrews, boldly approached Kai-Koumou, and, pointing to the hideous\nthrong, said:\n\n\"Drive them away!\"\n\nThe Maori chief gazed steadily at his prisoner without replying. Then\nwith a gesture he silenced the noisy horde. Glenarvan bowed in token of\nthanks, and slowly resumed his place among his friends.\n\nKai-Koumou, fearing an insurrection of the fanatics of his tribe, now\nled his captives to a sacred place, situated at the other end of the\npah, on the edge of a precipice. This hut rested against a rock that\nrose a hundred feet above it and was a steep boundary to this side of\nthe fortification. In this consecrated temple the priests, or \"arikis,\"\ninstruct the New Zealanders.

Which one do you wish to hear?\"\n\n\"They are not identical, then?\" cried Paganel.\n\n\"Yes, almost to a word.\"\n\n\"Well, give us the French document,\" said Glenarvan. \"This one was\nspared the most by the waves, and has served as the principal basis for\nour search.\"\n\n\"This is it, my lord, word for word,\" answered Harry Grant.\n\n\"'On the 27th June, 1862, the brig Britannia, of Glasgow, was lost\n1500 leagues from Patagonia, in the southern hemisphere. Carried by the\nwaves, two sailors and Captain Grant reached Tabor Island----'\"\n\n\"Ha!\" interrupted Paganel.\n\n\"'Here,'\" resumed Harry Grant, \"'continually a prey to a cruel\ndestitution, they cast this document into the sea at longitude 153° and\nlatitude 37° 11'. Come to their aid, or they are lost.'\"\n\nAt the word \"Tabor,\" Paganel had suddenly risen, and then, controlling\nhimself no longer, he cried:\n\n\"How Tabor Island? It is Maria Theresa.\"\n\n\"Certainly, Mr. Paganel,\" replied Harry Grant; \"Maria Theresa on the\nEnglish and German, but Tabor on the French maps.\"\n\nAt this moment a vigorous blow descended upon Paganel's shoulder. Truth\ncompels us to say that it was from the major, who now failed in his\nstrict habits of propriety.\n\n\"A fine geographer you are!\" said MacNabb, in a tone of badinage. \"But\nno matter, since we have succeeded.\"\n\n\"No matter?\" cried Paganel; \"I ought never to have forgotten that\ntwofold appellation! It is an unpardonable mistake, unworthy of the\nsecretary of a Geographical Society. I am disgraced!\"\n\nWhen the meal was finished, Harry Grant put everything in order in his\nhouse. He took nothing away, for he was willing that the guilty convict\nshould inherit his possessions.\n\nThey returned to the vessel; and, as he expected to sail the same day,\nGlenarvan gave orders for the quartermaster's landing. Ayrton was\nbrought on deck, and found himself in the presence of Harry Grant.\n\n\"It is I, Ayrton,\" said he.\n\n\"Yes, captain,\" replied Ayrton, without betraying any astonishment at\nHarry Grant's appearance. \"Well, I am not sorry to see you again in\ngood health.\"\n\n[Illustration: The passengers could see the quartermaster, with folded\narms, standing motionless as a statue, on a rock, and gazing at the\nvessel.]\n\n\"It seems, Ayrton, that I made a mistake in landing you on an inhabited\ncoast.\"\n\n\"It seems so, captain.\"\n\n\"You will take my place on this desert island. May Heaven lead you to\nrepentance!\"\n\n\"May it be so,\" rejoined Ayrton, in a calm tone.\n\nThen Glenarvan, addressing the quartermaster, said:\n\n\"Do you still adhere, Ayrton, to this determination to be abandoned?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord.\"\n\n\"Does Tabor Island suit you?\"\n\n\"Perfectly.\"\n\n\"Now listen to my last words. You will be far removed from every land,\nand deprived of all communication with your fellow-men. Miracles are\nrare, and you will not probably remove from this island, where we leave\nyou. You will be alone, under the eye of God, who reads the uttermost\ndepths of all hearts; but you will not be lost, as was Captain Grant.\nHowever unworthy you may be of the remembrance of men, still they will\nremember you. I know where you are, and will never forget you.\"\n\n\"Thank you, my lord!\" replied Ayrton, simply.\n\nSuch were the last words exchanged between Glenarvan and the\nquartermaster. The boat was ready, and Ayrton embarked. Captain Mangles\nhad previously sent to the island several cases of preserved food, some\nclothes, tools, weapons, and a supply of powder and shot. The abandoned\nman could therefore employ his time to advantage. Nothing was wanting,\nnot even books, foremost among which was a Bible.\n\nThe hour for separation had come.

The region of the springs was\npassed. Before the close of the day two more rapids were ascended, and\nat evening Kai-Koumou encamped a hundred miles above the junction of\nthe two streams. The river now turned towards the east, and then again\nflowed southward into Lake Taupo.\n\nThe next morning Jacques Paganel consulted his map and discovered\non the right bank Mount Taubara, which rises to the height of three\nthousand feet.

The waters of the surrounding country have rushed down and\nfilled this enormous cavity, and the abyss has become a lake, whose\ndepth no one has yet been able to measure.\n\nSuch is this strange Lake Taupo, elevated eleven hundred and fifty\nfeet above the level of the sea, and surrounded by lofty mountains. On\nthe west of the prisoners towered precipitous rocks of imposing form;\non the north rose several distant ridges, crowned with small forests;\non the east spread a broad plain furrowed by a trail and covered with\npumice-stones that glittered beneath a net-work of bushes; and on\nthe north, behind a stretch of woodland, volcanic peaks majestically\nencircled this vast extent of water, the fury of whose tempests equaled\nthat of the ocean cyclones.\n\nBut Paganel was scarcely disposed to enlarge his account of these\nwonders, nor were his friends in a mood to listen. They gazed in\nsilence towards the northeast shore of the lake, whither the canoe was\nbringing them.\n\nThe mission established at Pukawa, on the western shores, no longer\nexisted. The missionary had been driven by the war far from the\nprincipal dwellings of the insurrectionists. The prisoners were\nhelpless, abandoned to the mercy of the vengeful Maoris, and in that\nwild part of the island to which Christianity has never penetrated.\nKai-Koumou, leaving the waters of the Waikato, passed through the\nlittle creek which served as an outlet to the river, doubled a sharp\npromontory, and landed on the eastern border of the lake, at the base\nof the first slopes of Mount Manga.\n\nA quarter of a mile distant, on a buttress of the mountain, appeared\na \"pah,\" a Maori fortification, situated in an impregnable position.\nThe prisoners were taken ashore, with their hands and feet free, and\nconducted thither by the warriors.

Lady Helena would\nhave rushed towards her husband, but the major restrained her.\n\n\"These two ladies,\" continued Glenarvan, turning respectfully towards\nthem, \"hold a high rank in their country.\"\n\nThe warrior glanced coldly at his prisoner. A malicious smile passed\nover his face; but he almost instantly repressed it, and replied, in a\nvoice which he could scarcely control:\n\n\"Do you hope, then, to deceive Kai-Koumou by false words, cursed\nEuropean? Do you think that Kai-Koumou's eyes cannot read your heart?\"\n\nThen, pointing to Lady Helena, he said:\n\n\"That is your wife!\"\n\n\"No, mine!\" cried Kara-Tété.\n\nThen, pushing back the prisoners, the chief laid his hand on Lady\nHelena's shoulder, who grew pale at the touch.\n\n\"Edward!\" cried the unfortunate woman, in terror.\n\nGlenarvan, without uttering a word, raised his arm. A report resounded.\nKara-Tété fell dead.\n\nAt this sound a crowd of natives issued from the huts. The pah was\nfilled in an instant. A hundred arms were raised against the captives.\nGlenarvan's revolver was snatched from his hand.\n\nKai-Koumou cast a strange look at Glenarvan, and then, guarding with\none hand the person of him who had fired, he controlled with the other\nthe throng that was rushing upon the Europeans.\n\n[Illustration: At last his voice rose above the tumult. \"Taboo! taboo!\"\ncried he.]\n\nAt last his voice rose above the tumult.\n\n\"Taboo! taboo!\" cried he.\n\nAt this word the crowd fell back before Glenarvan and his companions,\nthus temporarily preserved by a supernatural power.

Some of the natives, the friends and\npartisans of Kai-Koumou, had stopped suddenly at the command of their\nchief, and had protected the captives.\n\n[Sidenote: THE TORTURES OF SUSPENSE.]\n\nGlenarvan, however, was not blind to the fate that was reserved for\nhim. Only his death could atone for the murder of a chief. Among savage\nraces death is always preceded by a protracted torture. He therefore\nexpected to cruelly expiate the righteous indignation that had nerved\nhis arm, but hoped that Kai-Koumou's rage would fall only on himself.\n\nWhat a night he and his companions passed! Who could depict their\nanguish, or measure their sufferings? Neither poor Robert nor brave\nPaganel had reappeared. But how could they doubt their fate? Were they\nnot the first victims of the natives' vengeance? All hope had vanished\neven from the heart of the major, who did not easily despair. John\nMangles felt himself growing mad at sight of the sad dejection of Mary\nGrant, thus separated from her brother. Glenarvan thought of that\nterrible request of Lady Helena, who, rather than yield to torture or\nslavery, preferred to die by his hand. Could he summon this fearful\ncourage? As for an escape, that was plainly impossible. Ten warriors,\narmed to the teeth, guarded the entrance of the temple.\n\nMorning came at last. There had been no communication between the\nnatives and the prisoners. The hut contained a considerable quantity\nof food, which the unfortunates scarcely touched. Hunger gave place to\ngrief. The day passed without bringing a change or a hope. Doubtless\nthe hour for the dead chief's funeral and their torture would be the\nsame.\n\nHowever, although Glenarvan concluded that Kai-Koumou must have\nabandoned all idea of exchange, the major on this point retained a\ngleam of hope.\n\n\"Who knows,\" said he, reminding Glenarvan of the effect produced upon\nthe chief by the death of Kara-Tété,--\"who knows but that Kai-Koumou in\nreality feels obliged to you?\"\n\nBut, in spite of these observations, Glenarvan would no longer hope.\nThe next day also passed away without the preparations for torture\nbeing made. The reason of the delay was this.\n\nThe Maoris believe that the soul, for three days after death, inhabits\nthe body of the deceased, and therefore during this time the corpse\nremains unburied. This custom was rigorously observed, and for two days\nthe pah was deserted. Captain Mangles frequently stood on Wilson's\nshoulders and surveyed the fortification. No native was seen; only the\nsentinels guarded in turn at the door of their prison.\n\nBut on the third day the huts were opened. The savages, men, women,\nand children, to the number of several hundreds, assembled in the pah,\nsilent and calm. Kai-Koumou came out of his house, and, surrounded by\nthe principal warriors of his tribe, took his place on a mound several\nfeet high in the centre of the fortification. The crowd of natives\nformed a semicircle aroun"}, {"chunk_id": 208, "text": "and if it shall itself devour its profaners the\ntaboo will be still more rigorous.\"\n\n\"This plan is really well conceived,\" remarked Glenarvan. \"There is\nonly one chance against it, and that is, that the savages may persist\nin remaining at the foot of the mountain till the provisions fail\nus. But this is scarcely probable, especially if we play our part\nskillfully.\"\n\n\"And when shall we make this last venture?\" asked Lady Helena.\n\n\"This very evening,\" answered Paganel, \"at the hour of the greatest\ndarkness.\"\n\n\"Agreed,\" said MacNabb. \"Paganel, you are a man of genius; and although\nfrom habit I am scarcely ever enthusiastic, I will answer for your\nsuccess. Ha! these rascals! we shall perform a little miracle for them\nthat will delay their conversion a good century. May the missionaries\npardon us!\"\n\nPaganel's plan was therefore adopted, and really, with the\nsuperstitious notions of the Maoris, it might and ought to succeed.\nIt only remained to execute it. The idea was good, but in practice\ndifficult. Might not this volcano consume the audacious ones who should\ndig the crater? Could they control and direct this eruption when the\nvapors, flames, and lava should be let loose? Would it not engulf\nthe entire peak in a flood of fire? They were tampering with those\nphenomena whose absolute control is reserved for forces higher than\ntheirs.\n\nPaganel had foreseen these difficulties, but he expected to act\nprudently, and not to venture to extremes. An illusion was enough to\ndeceive the Maoris, without the awful reality of a large eruption.\n\nHow long that day seemed! Each one counted the interminable hours.\nEverything was prepared for flight. The provisions of the tomb had\nbeen divided, and made into convenient bundles. Several mats, and the\nfire-arms, which had been found in the tomb of the chief, formed light\nbaggage. Of course these preparations were made within the palisaded\ninclosure and unknown to the savages.\n\nAt six o'clock the steward served a farewell feast. Where and when they\nshould eat in the valleys no one could foretell.\n\nTwilight came on. The sun disappeared behind a bank of dense clouds of\nthreatening aspect. A few flashes illumined the horizon, and a distant\npeal of thunder rumbled along the vault of the sky. Paganel welcomed\nthe storm that came to the aid of his design.\n\nAt eight o'clock the summit of the mountain was hidden by a foreboding\ndarkness, while the sky looked terribly black, as if for a background\nto the flaming outbreak that Paganel was about to inaugurate. The\nMaoris could no longer see their prisoners. The time for action had\ncome. Rapidity was necessary, and Glenarvan, Paganel, MacNabb, Robert,\nthe steward, and the two sailors at once set to work vigorously.\n\nThe place for the crater was chosen thirty paces from Kara-Tété's tomb.\nIt was important that this structure should be spared by the eruption,\nfor otherwise the taboo would become ineffective. Paganel had observed\nan enormous block of stone, around which the vapors seemed to pour\nforth with considerable force. This rocky mass covered a small natural\ncrater in the peak, and only by its weight prevented the escape of the\nsubterranean flames. If they could succeed in overturning it, the smoke\nand lava would immediately issue through the unobstructed opening.\n\n[Sidenote: VULCANS AT WORK.]\n\nThe fugitives made themselves levers out of the stakes of the tomb, and\nwith these they vigorously attacked the ponderous mass. Under their\nunited efforts the rock was not long in moving. They dug a sort of\ngroove for it down the side of the mountain, that it might slide on an\ninclined plane.\n\nAs their action increased, the trembling of the earth became more\nviolent. Hollow rumblings and hissings sounded under the thin\ncrust. But the bold experimenters, like real Vulcans, governing the\nunderground fires, worked on in silence. Several cracks and a few gusts\nof hot smoke warned them that their position was becoming dangerous.\nBut a final effort detached the block, which gli"}, {"chunk_id": 54, "text": "nd, wishing to save\nhis reputation, had begun with renewed energy his geographical\ndemonstrations, when the Patagonian stopped him with a gesture.\n\n\"You are searching for a prisoner?\" he said.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Paganel.\n\n\"And exactly on the line from the setting to the rising sun?\" said\nThalcave, indicating by a comparison, in the Indian manner, the course\nfrom west to east.\n\n\"Yes, yes, that is it!\"\n\n\"And it is your God,\" said the Patagonian, \"who has confided to the\nwaves of the vast ocean the secrets of the prisoner?\"\n\n\"God himself.\"\n\n\"May his will be accomplished then!\" replied Thalcave, with a certain\nsolemnity. \"We will go to the east, and, if necessary, even to the sun.\"\n\nPaganel, in his exultation over his pupil, immediately translated to\nhis companions the replies of the Indian.\n\nGlenarvan requested Paganel to ask the Patagonian if he had heard\nof any strangers falling into the hands of the Indians, which was\naccordingly done.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" replied the Patagonian.\n\nAs soon as this word was translated, Thalcave was surrounded by the\nseven travelers, who gazed at him with questioning looks. Paganel,\nexcited and scarcely finding his words, resumed these interesting\ninterrogatories, while his eyes, fixed upon the grave Indian, strove\nto anticipate his reply before it issued from his lips. Every word the\nPatagonian said he repeated in English, so that his companions heard\nthe Indian speak, as it were, in their own language.\n\n\"And this prisoner?\" inquired Paganel.\n\n\"He was a stranger,\" replied Thalcave slowly; \"a European.\"\n\n\"You have seen him?\"\n\n\"No, but he is mentioned in the accounts of the Indians. He was a brave\nman.\"\n\n\"You understand, my friends,\" said Paganel; \"a courageous man!\"\n\n\"My father!\" cried Robert Grant.\n\nThen, addressing Paganel:\n\n\"How do you say 'It is my father,' in Spanish?\" he asked.\n\n\"_Es mio padre_,\" answered the geographer.\n\nImmediately Robert, taking Thalcave's hands, said in a sweet voice,--\n\n\"_Es mio padre!_\"\n\n\"_Suo padre!_\" replied the Patagonian, whose look brightened.\n\nHe took the boy in his arms, lifted him from his horse, and gazed at\nhim with the most curious sympathy. His intelligent countenance became\nsuffused with a peaceful emotion.\n\nBut Paganel had not finished his inquiries. Where was this prisoner?\nWhat was he doing? When had Thalcave heard of him? All these questions\nthronged his mind at once. He did not have to wait long for answers,\nbut learnt that the European was a slave of one of the Indian tribes\nthat scour the plains.\n\n\"But where was he last?\" asked Paganel.\n\n\"With the cazique Calfoucoura,\" answered Thalcave.\n\n\"On the line we have been following?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And who is this cazique?\"\n\n\"The chief of the Poyuches Indians; a man with two tongues and two\nhearts.\"\n\n[Sidenote: A SCIENTIFIC BATH.]\n\n\"That is to say, false in word and in deed,\" said Paganel, after\ntranslating to his companions this beautiful metaphor of the Indian\nlanguage. \"And can we rescue our friend?\" he added.\n\n\"Perhaps so, if your friend is still in the hands of the Indians.\"\n\n\"And when did you hear of him?\"\n\n\"A long time ago, and, since then, the sun has brought back two summers\nto the sky.\"\n\nGlenarvan's joy could not be described. This answer coincided exactly\nwith the date of the document. But one question remained to be asked.\n\n\"You speak of a prisoner,\" said Paganel; \"but were there not three?\"\n\n\"I do not know,\" replied Thalcave.\n\n\"And you know nothing of their actual situation?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\nThis last word ended the conversation. It was possible that the three\nprisoners had been separated a long time. But the substance of the\nPatagonian's information was that the Indians spoke of a European who\nhad fallen into their power. The date of his captivity, the place where\nhe must have been, everything, even to the Patagonian phrase used to\nexpress his courage, related evidently to Captain Harry Grant.\n\nTheir progress was now somewhat slow and difficult; their next object\nbeing to reach and cross the river Colorado, to w"}]}

These facts, proved already by the precise details given\nby Ayrton, are still further corroborated by the conversation of the\nconvicts that I have related. Let us not, therefore, be led astray\nby vain conjectures, but only be certain that Ayrton is Ben Joyce, a\nsailor of the Britannia, now chief of a band of convicts.\"\n\nThe major's explanation was accepted as conclusive.\n\n\"Now,\" replied Glenarvan, \"will you tell me how and why Harry Grant's\nquartermaster is in Australia?\"\n\n\"How, I do not know,\" said MacNabb; \"and the police declare they know\nno more than I on the subject.

Chance threw us in his way. He heard Glenarvan's story of the\nshipwreck, and, like a bold man, he promptly decided to take part in\nthe expedition. At the Wimerra he communicated with one of his friends,\nthe farrier of Black Point, and thus left distinguishable traces of\nour course. His band followed us. A poisonous plant enabled him to\ngradually kill our oxen and horses. Then, at the proper moment, he\nentangled us in the marshes of the Snowy, and surrendered us to the\nconvicts he commanded.\"\n\nEverything possible had been said concerning Ben Joyce. His past had\njust been reviewed by the major, and the wretch appeared as he was,--a\nbold and formidable criminal. His intentions had been clearly proved,\nand required, on the part of Glenarvan, extreme vigilance. Fortunately,\nthere was less to fear from the detected bandit than the secret traitor.\n\nBut one serious fact appeared from this explanation. No one had yet\nthought of it; only Mary Grant, disregarding the past, looked forward\nto the future. Captain Mangles first saw her pale and disconsolate. He\nunderstood what was passing in her mind.\n\n\"Miss Mary!\" cried he, \"you are weeping!\"\n\n\"What is the matter, my child?\" asked Lady Helena.\n\n\"My father, madam, my father!\" replied the young girl.\n\nShe could not continue.

He accordingly consulted an old\ndervish, who told him that happiness was a very difficult thing to\nfind in this world. 'However,' added he, 'I know an infallible way\nto procure you happiness.' 'What is it?' inquired the young prince.\n'It is,' replied the dervish, 'to put on the shirt of a happy man.'\nThereupon the prince embraced the old man, and set out in search of his\ntalisman. He visited all the capitals of the earth; he tried the shirts\nof kings, emperors, princes, and nobles; but it was a useless task, he\nwas no happier. Then he put on the shirts of artists, warriors, and\nmerchants, but with no more success. He had thus traveled far, without\nfinding happiness. At last, desperate from having tried so many shirts,\nhe was returning very sadly one beautiful day to the palace of his\nfather, when he spied in the field an honest laborer, who was joyously\nsinging as he ploughed. 'Here is, at all events, a man who possesses\nhappiness,' said he to himself, 'or happiness does not exist on earth.'\nHe approached him. 'Good man,' said he, 'are you happy?' 'Yes,' replied\nthe other. 'You wish for nothing?' 'No.' 'You would not change your lot\nfor that of a king?' 'Never!' 'Well, sell me your shirt!' 'My shirt! I\nhave none!'\"\n\n[Illustration: They were agreed on this point, that it was necessary to\nhave courage for every fortune, and be contented with a tree when one\nhas neither palace nor cottage.]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV.\n\nBETWEEN FIRE AND WATER.\n\n\nJacques Paganel's story had a very great success. He was greatly\napplauded, but each retained his own opinion, and the geographer\nobtained the result common to most discussions,--of convincing nobody.\nHowever, they were agreed on this point, that it was necessary to have\ncourage for every fortune, and be contented with a tree when one has\nneither palace nor cottage.\n\nDuring the course of this confabulation evening had come on. Only a\ngood sleep could thoroughly refresh, after this eventful day. The\ninmates of the tree felt themselves not only fatigued by the sudden\nchanges of the inundation, but especially overcome by the heat, which\nhad been excessive. Their feathered companions had already set the\nexample; the hilgueros, those nightingales of the Pampas, had ceased\ntheir melodious warblings, and all the birds had disappeared in the\nrecesses of the foliage. The best plan was to imitate them.\n\nBut before \"retiring to their nest,\" as Paganel said, Glenarvan,\nRobert, and he climbed to the observatory, to examine for the last\ntime the watery expanse. It was about nine o'clock. The sun had just\nset in the sparkling mists of the horizon, and all the western part\nof the firmament was bathed in a warm vapor. The constellations,\nusually so dazzling, seemed veiled in a soft haze. Still they could\nbe distinguished, and Paganel pointed out to Robert, for Glenarvan's\nbenefit, that zone where the stars are most brilliant.\n\n[Sidenote: PHILOSOPHY AND PONCHOS.]\n\nWhile the geographer was discoursing thus, the whole eastern horizon\nassumed a stormy aspect. A dense and dark band, clearly defined,\ngradually rose, dimming the light of the stars. This cloud of\nthreatening appearance soon invaded almost the entire vault of the sky.\nIts motive power must have been inherent in itself, for there was not\na breath of wind. Not a leaf stirred on the tree, not a ripple curled\nthe surface of the waters. Even the air seemed to fail, as if some\nhuge pneumatic machine had rarefied it. A strong electric current was\nperceptible in the atmosphere, and every creature felt it course along\nthe nerves. Glenarvan, Paganel, and Robert were sensibly affected by\nthese electric currents.\n\n\"We shal"}, {"chunk_id": 227, "text": "t be sorry,\nMary?\"\n\n\"Why should I be sorry, my child?\"\n\n\"And you will let me do as I wish?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" asked she, anxiously.\n\n\"My sister, I shall be a sailor----!\"\n\n\"And leave me?\" cried the young girl, clasping her brother's hand.\n\n[Sidenote: EULOGY AND THRENODY.]\n\n\"Yes, sister, I shall be a sailor, like my father, and like Captain\nJohn.

He has promised that he will make me a\nthorough and efficient sailor, and we shall seek our father together.\nSay that you are willing, sister. What our father would have done for\nus it is our duty, or mine at least, to do for him. My life has but one\nobject, to which it is wholly devoted,--to search always for him who\nwould never have abandoned either of us. Dear Mary, how good our father\nwas!\"\n\n\"And so noble, so generous!\" added Mary. \"Do you know, Robert, that he\nwas already one of the glories of our country, and would have ranked\namong its great men if fate had not arrested his course?\"\n\n\"How well I know it!\" answered Robert.\n\nMary pressed her brother to her heart, and the child felt tears\ndropping upon his forehead.\n\n\"Mary! Mary!\" cried he, \"it is in vain for them to speak, or to keep\nsilent. I hope still, and shall always do so. A man like our father\ndoes not die till he has accomplished his purpose!\"\n\nMary Grant could not reply; sobs choked her utterance. A thousand\nemotions agitated her soul at the thought that new attempts would be\nmade to find her father, and that the young captain's devotion was\nboundless.\n\n\"Does Mr. John still hope?\" asked she.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Robert. \"He is a brother who will never forsake us. I\nshall be a sailor, shall I not, sister,--a sailor to seek my father\nwith him? Are you willing?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mary. \"But must we be separated?\"\n\n\"You will not be alone, Mary, I know.

All that has been well arranged by our\nfriend John and Lord Glenarvan, who will keep you at Malcolm Castle\nlike a daughter. He said so to John, who told me.

How much you resemble him, dear Robert! When you\nare a man you will be quite like him!\"\n\n\"God grant it, Mary!\" said Robert, glowing with holy and filial pride.\n\n\"But how shall we pay our debt to Lord and Lady Glenarvan?\" continued\nMary.\n\n\"Oh, that will not be difficult,\" answered Robert, with his boyish\nimpulsiveness. \"We will tell them how much we love and respect them,\nand we will show it to them by our actions.\"\n\n\"That is all we can do!\" added the young girl, covering her brother's\nface with kisses; \"and all that they will like, too!\"\n\nThen, relapsing into reveries, the two children of the captain gazed\nsilently into the shadowy obscurity of the night. However, in fancy\nthey still conversed, questioned, and answered each other. The sea\nrocked the ship in silence, and the phosphorescent waters glistened in\nthe darkness.\n\nBut now a strange, a seemingly supernatural event took place. The\nbrother and sister, by one of those magnetic attractions that\nmysteriously draw the souls of friends together, experienced at the\nsame instant the same curious hallucination.\n\n[Sidenote: \"METHOUGHT, THE BILLOWS SPOKE!\"]\n\nFrom the midst of these alternately brightening and darkening waves,\nthey thought they heard a voice issue, whose depth of sadness stirred\nevery fibre of their hearts.\n\n\"Help! help!\" cried the voice.\n\n\"Mary,\" said Robert, \"did you hear?"}, {"chunk_id": 33, "text": "ur separation will be short, and----\"\n\n[Illustration: The mate, Tom Austin, Wilson, a powerful fellow, and\nMulready, were the fortunate ones.]\n\n[Sidenote: GOOD AFTERNOON!]\n\n\"Yes, yes; I understand you,\" answered Lady Helena. \"Go, then, and may\nyou succeed in your enterprise.\"\n\n\"Besides, this is not a journey,\" added Paganel.\n\n\"What is it, then?\" asked Lady Helena.\n\n\"A passage, nothing more. We shall pass, that is all, like honest\nmen, over the country and do all the good possible. '_Transire\nbenefaciendo_' is our motto.\"\n\nWith these words the discussion ended. The preparations were begun that\nvery day, and it was resolved to keep the expedition secret, in order\nnot to alarm the Indians. The 14th of October was fixed for the day of\ndeparture.\n\nWhen they came to choose the sailors who were to go, they all offered\ntheir services, and Glenarvan was forced to make a choice. He preferred\nto have them draw lots, that he might not mortify such brave men. This\nwas accordingly done; and the mate, Tom Austin, Wilson, a powerful\nfellow, and Mulready, were the fortunate ones.\n\nLord Glenarvan had displayed great energy in his preparations, for he\nwished to be ready at the day appointed; and he was. Captain Mangles\nlikewise supplied his ship with coal, that he might put to sea at any\nmoment. He wished to gain the Argentine shore before the travelers.\nHence there was a real rivalry between Glenarvan and the captain, which\nwas of advantage to both.\n\nAt last, on the 14th of October, at the time agreed upon, every one was\nready. At the moment of departure the passengers of the yacht assembled\nin the cabin. The Duncan was on the point of starting, and already her\npropeller was agitating the quiet waters of Talcahuana Bay. Glenarvan,\nPaganel, MacNabb, Robert Grant, Tom Austin, Wilson and Mulready, armed\nwith carbines and Colt's revolvers, were preparing to leave the vessel.\nGuides and mules were waiting for them on shore.\n\n\"It is time,\" said Lord Glenarvan at last.\n\n\"Go, then, my husband!\" replied Lady Helena, restraining her emotion.\n\nHe pressed her to his breast, while Robert threw himself upon the neck\nof his sister.\n\n\"And now, dear companions,\" said Jacques Paganel, \"one last clasp of\nthe hand to last us till we reach the shores of the Atlantic.\"\n\nIt was not asking much, but these were clasps which would strengthen\nthe hopes of the worthy geographer.\n\nThey then returned to the deck, and the seven travelers left the\nvessel. They soon reached the wharf, which the yacht approached within\nless than half a cable's length.\n\nLady Helena cried for the last time,--\n\n\"My friends, God help you!\"\n\n\"And he will help us, madam,\" answered Jacques Paganel; \"for, I assure\nyou, we shall help ourselves.\"\n\n\"Forward!\" shouted Captain Mangles to his engineer.\n\n\"_En route_!\" returned Glenarvan; and at the same instant that the\ntravelers, giving reins to their animals, followed the road along the\nshore, the Duncan started again at full speed on the highway of the\nocean.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\nTRAVELING IN CHILI.\n\n\nThe native troop engaged by Glenarvan consisted of three men and a boy.\nThe leader of the muleteers was an Englishman who had lived in the\ncountry for twenty years. His occupation was to let mules to travelers,\nand guide them across the passes of the Andes. Then he consigned them\nto the care of a \"laqueano\" (Argentine guide), who was familiar with\nthe road over the Pampas.\n\n[Sidenote: THE PROCESSION FORMED.]\n\nThis Englishman had not so forgotten his native tongue, in the company\nof mules and Indians, that he could not converse with the travelers.\nHence it was easy for Glenarvan to make known his wishes, and for\nthe muleteer to execute his orders, of which circumstance the former\navailed himself, since Paganel had not yet succeeded in making himself\nunderstood.\n\nThis leader, or \"catapaz,\" in the language of Chili, was assisted by\ntwo native peons and a boy of twelve. The peons had charge of the\nmules laden with the baggage of the party, and the boy led the madrina"}, {"chunk_id": 218, "text": "ave nothing to say, my lord. I was foolish enough to let myself be\ntaken. Do what you please.\"\n\n[Sidenote: A DUMB PRISONER.]\n\nHaving given his answer, the quartermaster turned his eyes toward\nthe coast that extended along the west, and affected a profound\nindifference for all that was passing around him. You would have\nthought, to look at him, that he was a stranger to this serious affair.\n\nBut Glenarvan had resolved to be patient. A powerful motive urged\nhim to ascertain certain circumstances of Ayrton's mysterious life,\nespecially as regarded Harry Grant and the Britannia. He therefore\nresumed his inquiries, speaking with extreme mildness, and imposing the\nmost perfect calmness upon the violent agitation of his heart.\n\n\"I hope, Ayrton,\" continued he, \"that you will not refuse to answer\ncertain questions that I desire to ask you. And, first, am I to call\nyou Ayrton or Ben Joyce? Are you the quartermaster of the Britannia?\"\n\nAyrton remained unmoved, watching the coast, deaf to every question.\nGlenarvan, whose eye flashed with some inward emotion, continued to\nquestion him.\n\n\"Will you tell me how you left the Britannia, and why you were in\nAustralia?\"\n\nThere was the same silence, the same obstinacy.\n\n\"Listen to me, Ayrton,\" resumed Glenarvan. \"It is for your interest to\nspeak. We may reward a frank confession, which is your only resort. For\nthe last time, will you answer my questions?\"\n\nAyrton turned his head towards Glenarvan, and looked him full in the\nface.\n\n\"My lord,\" said he, \"I have nothing to answer. It is for justice to\nprove against me.\"\n\n\"The proofs will be easy,\" replied Glenarvan.\n\n[Sidenote: USELESS APPEALS.]\n\n\"Easy, my lord?\" continued the quartermaster, in a sneering tone.\n\"Your lordship seems to me very hasty. I declare that the best judge\nin Westminster Hall would be puzzled to establish my identity. Who can\nsay why I came to Australia, since Captain Grant is no longer here to\ninform you? Who can prove that I am that Ben Joyce described by the\npolice, since they have never laid hands upon me, and my companions are\nat liberty? Who, except you, can charge me, not to say with a crime,\nbut even with a culpable action?\"\n\n[Illustration: Ayrton soon made his appearance. He crossed the deck\nwith a confident step, and ascended the poop-stairs.]\n\nAyrton had grown animated while speaking, but soon relapsed into his\nformer indifference. He doubtless imagined that this declaration would\nend the examination: but Glenarvan resumed, and said:\n\n\"Ayrton, I am not a judge charged with trying you. This is not my\nbusiness.

Fortunately,\nthere was less to fear from the detected bandit than the secret traitor.\n\nBut one serious fact appeared from this explanation. No one had yet\nthought of it; only Mary Grant, disregarding the past, looked forward\nto the future. Captain Mangles first saw her pale and disconsolate.

Mary, my dear Mary, he has not lost all hope! You will have, like\nme, confidence in his devotion. He has promised that he will make me a\nthorough and efficient sailor, and we shall seek our father together.\nSay that you are willing, sister. What our father would have done for\nus it is our duty, or mine at least, to do for him. My life has but one\nobject, to which it is wholly devoted,--to search always for him who\nwould never have abandoned either of us. Dear Mary, how good our father\nwas!\"\n\n\"And so noble, so generous!\" added Mary. \"Do you know, Robert, that he\nwas already one of the glories of our country, and would have ranked\namong its great men if fate had not arrested his course?\"\n\n\"How well I know it!\" answered Robert.\n\nMary pressed her brother to her heart, and the child felt tears\ndropping upon his forehead.\n\n\"Mary! Mary!\" cried he, \"it is in vain for them to speak, or to keep\nsilent. I hope still, and shall always do so. A man like our father\ndoes not die till he has accomplished his purpose!\"\n\nMary Grant could not reply; sobs choked her utterance. A thousand\nemotions agitated her soul at the thought that new attempts would be\nmade to find her father, and that the young captain's devotion was\nboundless.\n\n\"Does Mr. John still hope?\" asked she.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Robert. \"He is a brother who will never forsake us. I\nshall be a sailor, shall I not, sister,--a sailor to seek my father\nwith him? Are you willing?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mary. \"But must we be separated?\"\n\n\"You will not be alone, Mary, I know. John has told me so. Lady Helena\nwill not permit you to leave her. You are a woman, and can and ought to\naccept her benefits. To refuse them would be ungrateful. But a man, as\nmy father has told me a hundred times, ought to make his own fortune.\"\n\n\"But what will become of our house at Dundee, so full of associations?\"\n\n\"We will keep it, my sister. All that has been well arranged by our\nfriend John and Lord Glenarvan, who will keep you at Malcolm Castle\nlike a daughter. He said so to John, who told me. You will be at home\nthere, and wait till John and I bring back our father. Ah, what a\njoyful day that will be!\" cried Robert, whose face was radiant with\nenthusiasm.\n\n\"My brother, my child!\" exclaimed Mary, \"how happy our father would be\nif he could hear you! How much you resemble him, dear Robert! When you\nare a man you will be quite like him!\"\n\n\"God grant it, Mary!\" said Robert, glowing with holy and filial pride.\n\n\"But how shall we pay our debt to Lord and Lady Glenarvan?\" continued\nMary.\n\n\"Oh, that will not be difficult,\" answered Robert, with his boyish\nimpulsiveness. \"We will tell them how much we love and respect them,\nand we will show it to them by our actions.\"\n\n\"That is all we can do!\" added the young girl, covering her brother's\nface with kisses; \"and all that they will like, too!\"\n\nThen, relapsing into reveries, the two children of the captain gazed\nsilently into the shadowy obscurity of the night. However, in fancy\nthey still conversed, questioned, and answered each other. The sea\nrocked the ship in silence, and the phosphorescent waters glistened in\nthe darkness.\n\nBut now a strange, a seemingly supernatural event took place. The\nbrother and sister, by one of those magnetic attractions that\nmysteriously draw the souls of friends together, experienced at the\nsame instant the same curious hallucination.\n\n[Sidenote: \"METHOUGHT, THE BILLOWS SPOKE!\"]\n\nFrom the midst of these alternately brightening and darkening waves,\nthey thought they heard a voice issue, whose depth of sadness stirred\nevery fibre of their hearts.\n\n\"Help! help!\" cried the voice.\n\n\"Mary,\" said Robert, \"did you hear?"}, {"chunk_id": 113, "text": "hed\nthe hospitable dwelling of Mr. O'Moore, where his labor insured him a\ncomfortable livelihood.\n\n\"And if Ayrton is pleased with me,\" said the Irish colonist, when the\nstory was finished, \"I cannot but be pleased with him. He is an honest\nand intelligent man, a good worker, and, if he chooses, this house\nshall long be at his service.\"\n\nAyrton thanked Mr. O'Moore, and waited for further questions. He\nprobably thought, however, that the legitimate curiosity of his hearers\nought to be satisfied. What could he say that had not been repeated\na hundred times already? Glenarvan was, therefore, about to open the\nconversation on a new topic, to profit by the information received from\nAyrton, when the major, addressing him, said:\n\n\"You were quartermaster of the Britannia?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Ayrton.\n\nBut perceiving that a certain feeling of distrust, a doubt, however\nslight, had suggested this inquiry, he added,--\n\n\"I saved my contract from the wreck.\"\n\nHe immediately left the room in search of this authoritative document.\nDuring his absence, which lasted but a few moments, Mr. O'Moore said:\n\n\"My lord, I will answer for it that Ayrton is an honest man. During the\ntwo months that he has been in my employ, I have had no fault to find\nwith him. I knew the story of his shipwreck and captivity. He is a true\nman, and worthy of your entire confidence.\"\n\nGlenarvan was about to answer that he had never doubted Ayrton's\nhonesty, when the latter returned and presented his contract. It was a\npaper signed by the owners of the Britannia and Captain Grant, whose\nwriting Mary recognized immediately. It stated that \"Tom Ayrton, able\nseaman, was engaged as quartermaster on board the brig Britannia of\nGlasgow.\" There was, therefore, no possible doubt of Ayrton's identity,\nfor it would have been difficult to suppose that this contract could be\nin his hands and not belong to him.\n\n[Sidenote: ENTANGLEMENTS.]\n\n\"Now,\" said Glenarvan, \"I appeal to you all for advice as to what is\nbest to be done. Your advice, Ayrton, would be particularly valuable,\nand I should be much obliged if you would give it to us.\"\n\nThe sailor reflected a few moments, and then replied:\n\n\"I thank you, my lord, for the confidence you place in me, and hope to\nshow myself worthy of it. I have some knowledge of the country, and of\nthe customs of the natives; and, if I can be of use to you----\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" replied Glenarvan.\n\n\"I think, like you,\" continued Ayrton, \"that Captain Grant and his two\nsailors were saved from the shipwreck; but, since they have not reached\nthe English possessions, since they have not reappeared, I doubt not\nthat their fate was the same as my own, and that they are prisoners of\nthe natives.\"\n\n\"You repeat, Mr. Ayrton, the arguments that I have already\nsubstantiated,\" said Paganel. \"The shipwrecked seamen are evidently\nprisoners of the natives, as they feared. But ought we to suppose that,\nlike you, they have been carried to the north?\"\n\n\"It is quite likely, sir,\" replied Ayrton. \"The hostile tribes would\nhardly remain in the neighborhood of the English provinces.\"\n\n\"This fact will complicate our search,\" said Glenarvan, quite\ndisconcerted. \"How shall we find the traces of the prisoners in the\ninterior of so vast a continent?\"\n\nA prolonged silence followed this remark. Lady Helena frequently\ncast a questioning glance at her companions, but without eliciting a\nresponsive sign. Paganel himself was silent, contrary to his custom.\nHis usual ingenuity now failed him. Captain Mangles paced the room with\nlong strides, as if he had been on the deck of his vessel, involved in\nsome difficulty.\n\n\"And you, Mr. Ayrton,\" said Lady Helena, at length, to the\nquartermaster, \"what would you do?\"\n\n\"Madam,\" replied he, promptly, \"I should re-embark on board the Duncan,\nand go straight to the place of the shipwreck. There I should act\naccording to circumstances, or indications that chance might furnish.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" said Glenarvan; \"but we must wait till the Duncan is\nrepaired.\"\n\n\"Ah! you"}, {"chunk_id": 217, "text": "What do you mean, Tom?\" inquired Glenarvan.\n\n\"I mean,\" he replied, \"that when the quartermaster, Ayrton, learned,\nthe day after our departure, the Duncan's destination----\"\n\n\"Ayrton!\" cried Glenarvan. \"Is he on board?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord.\"\n\n\"Ayrton here!\" repeated Glenarvan, glancing at Captain Mangles.\n\n\"Wonderful indeed!\" said the young captain.\n\nIn an instant, with the swiftness of lightning, Ayrton's conduct, his\nlong-contrived treachery, Glenarvan's wound, the attack upon Mulready,\ntheir sufferings in the marshes of the Snowy, all the wretch's deeds,\nflashed upon the minds of the two men. And now, by a strange fatality,\nthe convict was in their power.\n\n\"Where is he?\" asked Glenarvan quickly.\n\n\"In a cabin in the forecastle,\" replied Tom Austin, \"closely guarded.\"\n\n\"Why this confinement?\"\n\n[Sidenote: AN UNOFFICIAL TRIBUNAL.]\n\n\"Because, when Ayrton saw that the yacht was sailing for New Zealand,\nhe flew into a passion; because he attempted to force me to change the\nship's course; because he threatened me; and, finally, because he urged\nmy men to a mutiny. I saw that he was a dangerous person, and was\ncompelled, therefore, to take precautions against him.\"\n\n\"And since that time?\"\n\n\"Since that time he has been in his cabin, without offering to come\nout.\"\n\n\"Good!\"\n\nAt this moment Glenarvan and Captain Mangles were summoned to the\nsaloon. Breakfast, which they so much needed, was ready. They took\nseats at the table, but did not speak of Ayrton.\n\nHowever, when the meal was ended, and the passengers had assembled on\ndeck, Glenarvan informed them of the quartermaster's presence on board.\nAt the same time he declared his intention of sending for him.\n\n\"Can I be released from attending this tribunal?\" asked Lady Helena.\n\"I confess to you, my dear Edward, that the sight of this unfortunate\nwould be very painful to me.\"\n\n\"It is only to confront him, Helena,\" replied Glenarvan. \"Remain,\nif you can. Ben Joyce should see himself face to face with all his\nintended victims.\"\n\nLady Helena yielded to this request, and Mary Grant and she took their\nplaces beside him, while around them stood the major, Paganel, Captain\nMangles, Robert, Wilson, Mulready, and Olbinett, all who had suffered\nso severely by the convict's treason. The crew of the yacht, who did\nnot yet understand the seriousness of these proceedings, maintained a\nprofound silence.\n\n\"Call Ayrton!\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVI.\n\nAYRTON'S OBSTINACY.\n\n\nAyrton soon made his appearance. He crossed the deck with a confident\nstep, and ascended the poop-stairs. His eyes had a sullen look, his\nteeth were set, and his fists clinched convulsively. His bearing\ndisplayed neither exultation nor humility. As soon as he was in Lord\nGlenarvan's presence, he folded his arms, and calmly and silently\nwaited to be questioned:\n\n\"Ayrton,\" said Glenarvan, \"here we all are, as you see, on board the\nDuncan, that you would have surrendered to Ben Joyce's accomplices.\"\n\nAt these words the lips of the quartermaster slightly trembled. A quick\nblush colored his hard features,--not the sign of remorse, but the\nshame of defeat. He was prisoner on this yacht that he had meant to\ncommand as master, and his fate was soon to be decided.\n\nHowever, he made no reply. Glenarvan waited patiently, but Ayrton still\npersisted in maintaining an obstinate silence.\n\n\"Speak, Ayrton; what have you to say?\" continued Glenarvan.\n\nThe convict hesitated, and the lines of his forehead were strongly\ncontracted. At last he said, in a calm voice:\n\n\"I have nothing to say, my lord. I was foolish enough to let myself be\ntaken. Do what you please.\"\n\n[Sidenote: A DUMB PRISONER.]\n\nHaving given his answer, the quartermaster turned his eyes toward\nthe coast that extended along the west, and affected a profound\nindifference for all that was passing around him. You would have\nthought, to look at him, that he was a stranger to this serious affair.\n\nBut Glenarvan had resolved to be patient.

A powerful motive urged\nhim to ascertain certain circumstances of Ayrton's mysterious life,\nespecially as regarded Harry Grant and the Britannia. He therefore\nresumed his inquiries, speaking with extreme mildness, and imposing the\nmost perfect calmness upon the violent agitation of his heart.\n\n\"I hope, Ayrton,\" continued he, \"that you will not refuse to answer\ncertain questions that I desire to ask you. And, first, am I to call\nyou Ayrton or Ben Joyce? Are you the quartermaster of the Britannia?\"\n\nAyrton remained unmoved, watching the coast, deaf to every question.\nGlenarvan, whose eye flashed with some inward emotion, continued to\nquestion him.\n\n\"Will you tell me how you left the Britannia, and why you were in\nAustralia?\"\n\nThere was the same silence, the same obstinacy.\n\n\"Listen to me, Ayrton,\" resumed Glenarvan. \"It is for your interest to\nspeak. We may reward a frank confession, which is your only resort. For\nthe last time, will you answer my questions?\"\n\nAyrton turned his head towards Glenarvan, and looked him full in the\nface.\n\n\"My lord,\" said he, \"I have nothing to answer. It is for justice to\nprove against me.\"\n\n\"The proofs will be easy,\" replied Glenarvan.\n\n[Sidenote: USELESS APPEALS.]\n\n\"Easy, my lord?\" continued the quartermaster, in a sneering tone.\n\"Your lordship seems to me very hasty. I declare that the best judge\nin Westminster Hall would be puzzled to establish my identity. Who can\nsay why I came to Australia, since Captain Grant is no longer here to\ninform you? Who can prove that I am that Ben Joyce described by the\npolice, since they have never laid hands upon me, and my companions are\nat liberty? Who, except you, can charge me, not to say with a crime,\nbut even with a culpable action?\"\n\n[Illustration: Ayrton soon made his appearance. He crossed the deck\nwith a confident step, and ascended the poop-stairs.]\n\nAyrton had grown animated while speaking, but soon relapsed into his\nformer indifference. He doubtless imagined that this declaration would\nend the examination: but Glenarvan resumed, and said:\n\n\"Ayrton, I am not a judge charged with trying you. This is not my\nbusiness. It is important that our respective positions should be\nclearly defined. I ask nothing that can implicate you, for that is the\npart of justice. But you know what search I am pursuing, and, with a\nword, you can put me on the track I have lost. Will you speak?\"\n\nAyrton shook his head, like a man determined to keep silent.\n\n\"Will you tell me where Captain Grant is?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"No, my lord.\"\n\n\"Will you point out where the Britannia was wrecked?\"\n\n\"Certainly not.\"\n\n\"Ayrton,\" said Glenarvan, in almost a suppliant tone, \"will you, at\nleast, if you know where Captain Grant is, tell his poor children, who\nare only waiting for a word from your lips?\"\n\nThe quartermaster hesitated; his features quivered; but, in a low\nvoice, he muttered:\n\n\"I cannot, my lord.\"\n\nThen, as if he reproached himself for a moment's weakness, he added,\nangrily:\n\n\"No, I will not speak!

I have some knowledge of the country, and of\nthe customs of the natives; and, if I can be of use to you----\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" replied Glenarvan.\n\n\"I think, like you,\" continued Ayrton, \"that Captain Grant and his two\nsailors were saved from the shipwreck; but, since they have not reached\nthe English possessions, since they have not reappeared, I doubt not\nthat their fate was the same as my own, and that they are prisoners of\nthe natives.\"\n\n\"You repeat, Mr. Ayrton, the arguments that I have already\nsubstantiated,\" said Paganel. \"The shipwrecked seamen are evidently\nprisoners of the natives, as they feared. But ought we to suppose that,\nlike you, they have been carried to the north?\"\n\n\"It is quite likely, sir,\" replied Ayrton. \"The hostile tribes would\nhardly remain in the neighborhood of the English provinces.\"\n\n\"This fact will complicate our search,\" said Glenarvan, quite\ndisconcerted. \"How shall we find the traces of the prisoners in the\ninterior of so vast a continent?\"\n\nA prolonged silence followed this remark. Lady Helena frequently\ncast a questioning glance at her companions, but without eliciting a\nresponsive sign. Paganel himself was silent, contrary to his custom.\nHis usual ingenuity now failed him. Captain Mangles paced the room with\nlong strides, as if he had been on the deck of his vessel, involved in\nsome difficulty.\n\n\"And you, Mr. Ayrton,\" said Lady Helena, at length, to the\nquartermaster, \"what would you do?\"\n\n\"Madam,\" replied he, promptly, \"I should re-embark on board the Duncan,\nand go straight to the place of the shipwreck. There I should act\naccording to circumstances, or indications that chance might furnish.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" said Glenarvan; \"but we must wait till the Duncan is\nrepaired.\"\n\n\"Ah! you"}, {"chunk_id": 217, "text": "What do you mean, Tom?\" inquired Glenarvan.\n\n\"I mean,\" he replied, \"that when the quartermaster, Ayrton, learned,\nthe day after our departure, the Duncan's destination----\"\n\n\"Ayrton!\" cried Glenarvan. \"Is he on board?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord.\"\n\n\"Ayrton here!\" repeated Glenarvan, glancing at Captain Mangles.\n\n\"Wonderful indeed!\" said the young captain.\n\nIn an instant, with the swiftness of lightning, Ayrton's conduct, his\nlong-contrived treachery, Glenarvan's wound, the attack upon Mulready,\ntheir sufferings in the marshes of the Snowy, all the wretch's deeds,\nflashed upon the minds of the two men. And now, by a strange fatality,\nthe convict was in their power.\n\n\"Where is he?\" asked Glenarvan quickly.\n\n\"In a cabin in the forecastle,\" replied Tom Austin, \"closely guarded.\"\n\n\"Why this confinement?\"\n\n[Sidenote: AN UNOFFICIAL TRIBUNAL.]\n\n\"Because, when Ayrton saw that the yacht was sailing for New Zealand,\nhe flew into a passion; because he attempted to force me to change the\nship's course; because he threatened me; and, finally, because he urged\nmy men to a mutiny. I saw that he was a dangerous person, and was\ncompelled, therefore, to take precautions against him.\"\n\n\"And since that time?\"\n\n\"Since that time he has been in his cabin, without offering to come\nout.\"\n\n\"Good!\"\n\nAt this moment Glenarvan and Captain Mangles were summoned to the\nsaloon. Breakfast, which they so much needed, was ready. They took\nseats at the table, but did not speak of Ayrton.\n\nHowever, when the meal was ended, and the passengers had assembled on\ndeck, Glenarvan informed them of the quartermaster's presence on board.\nAt the same time he declared his intention of sending for him.\n\n\"Can I be released from attending this tribunal?\" asked Lady Helena.\n\"I confess to you, my dear Edward, that the sight of this unfortunate\nwould be very painful to me.\"\n\n\"It is only to confront him, Helena,\" replied Glenarvan. \"Remain,\nif you can. Ben Joyce should see himself face to face with all his\nintended victims.\"\n\nLady Helena yielded to this request, and Mary Grant and she took their\nplaces beside him, while around them stood the major, Paganel, Captain\nMangles, Robert, Wilson, Mulready, and Olbinett, all who had suffered\nso severely by the convict's treason. The crew of the yacht, who did\nnot yet understand the seriousness of these proceedings, maintained a\nprofound silence.\n\n\"Call Ayrton!\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVI.\n\nAYRTON'S OBSTINACY.\n\n\nAyrton soon made his appearance. He crossed the deck with a confident\nstep, and ascended the poop-stairs. His eyes had a sullen look, his\nteeth were set, and his fists clinched convulsively. His bearing\ndisplayed neither exultation nor humility. As soon as he was in Lord\nGlenarvan's presence, he folded his arms, and calmly and silently\nwaited to be questioned:\n\n\"Ayrton,\" said Glenarvan, \"here we all are, as you see, on board the\nDuncan, that you would have surrendered to Ben Joyce's accomplices.\"\n\nAt these words the lips of the quartermaster slightly trembled. A quick\nblush colored his hard features,--not the sign of remorse, but the\nshame of defeat. He was prisoner on this yacht that he had meant to\ncommand as master, and his fate was soon to be decided.\n\nHowever, he made no reply. Glenarvan waited patiently, but Ayrton still\npersisted in maintaining an obstinate silence.\n\n\"Speak, Ayrton; what have you to say?\" continued Glenarvan.\n\nThe convict hesitated, and the lines of his forehead were strongly\ncontracted. At last he said, in a calm voice:\n\n\"I have nothing to say, my lord. I was foolish enough to let myself be\ntaken. Do what you please.\"\n\n[Sidenote: A DUMB PRISONER.]\n\nHaving given his answer, the quartermaster turned his eyes toward\nthe coast that extended along the west, and affected a profound\nindifference for all that was passing around him.

A powerful motive urged\nhim to ascertain certain circumstances of Ayrton's mysterious life,\nespecially as regarded Harry Grant and the Britannia. He therefore\nresumed his inquiries, speaking with extreme mildness, and imposing the\nmost perfect calmness upon the violent agitation of his heart.\n\n\"I hope, Ayrton,\" continued he, \"that you will not refuse to answer\ncertain questions that I desire to ask you. And, first, am I to call\nyou Ayrton or Ben Joyce? Are you the quartermaster of the Britannia?\"\n\nAyrton remained unmoved, watching the coast, deaf to every question.\nGlenarvan, whose eye flashed with some inward emotion, continued to\nquestion him.\n\n\"Will you tell me how you left the Britannia, and why you were in\nAustralia?\"\n\nThere was the same silence, the same obstinacy.\n\n\"Listen to me, Ayrton,\" resumed Glenarvan. \"It is for your interest to\nspeak. We may reward a frank confession, which is your only resort. For\nthe last time, will you answer my questions?\"\n\nAyrton turned his head towards Glenarvan, and looked him full in the\nface.\n\n\"My lord,\" said he, \"I have nothing to answer. It is for justice to\nprove against me.\"\n\n\"The proofs will be easy,\" replied Glenarvan.\n\n[Sidenote: USELESS APPEALS.]\n\n\"Easy, my lord?\" continued the quartermaster, in a sneering tone.\n\"Your lordship seems to me very hasty. I declare that the best judge\nin Westminster Hall would be puzzled to establish my identity. Who can\nsay why I came to Australia, since Captain Grant is no longer here to\ninform you? Who can prove that I am that Ben Joyce described by the\npolice, since they have never laid hands upon me, and my companions are\nat liberty? Who, except you, can charge me, not to say with a crime,\nbut even with a culpable action?\"\n\n[Illustration: Ayrton soon made his appearance. He crossed the deck\nwith a confident step, and ascended the poop-stairs.]\n\nAyrton had grown animated while speaking, but soon relapsed into his\nformer indifference. He doubtless imagined that this declaration would\nend the examination: but Glenarvan resumed, and said:\n\n\"Ayrton, I am not a judge charged with trying you. This is not my\nbusiness. It is important that our respective positions should be\nclearly defined. I ask nothing that can implicate you, for that is the\npart of justice. But you know what search I am pursuing, and, with a\nword, you can put me on the track I have lost. Will you speak?\"\n\nAyrton shook his head, like a man determined to keep silent.\n\n\"Will you tell me where Captain Grant is?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"No, my lord.\"\n\n\"Will you point out where the Britannia was wrecked?\"\n\n\"Certainly not.\"\n\n\"Ayrton,\" said Glenarvan, in almost a suppliant tone, \"will you, at\nleast, if you know where Captain Grant is, tell his poor children, who\nare only waiting for a word from your lips?\"\n\nThe quartermaster hesitated; his features quivered; but, in a low\nvoice, he muttered:\n\n\"I cannot, my lord.\"\n\nThen, as if he reproached himself for a moment's weakness, he added,\nangrily:\n\n\"No, I will not speak! Hang me if you will!\"\n\n\"Hang, then!\" cried Glenarvan, overcome by a sudden feeling of\nindignation.\n\nBut finally controlling himself, he said, in a grave voice:\n\n\"There are neither judges nor hangmen here. At the first landing-place\nyou shall be put into the hands of the English authorities.\"\n\n\"Just what I desire,\" replied the quartermaster.\n\nThereupon he was taken back to the cabin that served as his prison, and\ntwo sailors were stationed at the door, with orders to watch all his\nmovements. The witnesses of this scene retired indignant and in despair.\n\nSince Gl"}, {"chunk_id": 227, "text": "t be sorry,\nMary?\"\n\n\"Why should I be sorry, my child?\"\n\n\"And you will let me do as I wish?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" asked she, anxiously.\n\n\"My sister, I shall be a sailor----!\"\n\n\"And leave me?\" cried the young girl, clasping her brother's hand.\n\n[Sidenote: EULOGY AND THRENODY.]\n\n\"Yes, sister, I shall be a sailor, like my father, and like Captain\nJohn.

In my opinion this man's\nreal name is Ayrton. Ben Joyce is his fighting title. It is certain\nthat he knows Harry Grant, and has been quartermaster on board the\nBritannia. These facts, proved already by the precise details given\nby Ayrton, are still further corroborated by the conversation of the\nconvicts that I have related. Let us not, therefore, be led astray\nby vain conjectures, but only be certain that Ayrton is Ben Joyce, a\nsailor of the Britannia, now chief of a band of convicts.\"\n\nThe major's explanation was accepted as conclusive.\n\n\"Now,\" replied Glenarvan, \"will you tell me how and why Harry Grant's\nquartermaster is in Australia?\"\n\n\"How, I do not know,\" said MacNabb; \"and the police declare they know\nno more than I on the subject.

Chance threw us in his way. He heard Glenarvan's story of the\nshipwreck, and, like a bold man, he promptly decided to take part in\nthe expedition. At the Wimerra he communicated with one of his friends,\nthe farrier of Black Point, and thus left distinguishable traces of\nour course. His band followed us. A poisonous plant enabled him to\ngradually kill our oxen and horses. Then, at the proper moment, he\nentangled us in the marshes of the Snowy, and surrendered us to the\nconvicts he commanded.\"\n\nEverything possible had been said concerning Ben Joyce. His past had\njust been reviewed by the major, and the wretch appeared as he was,--a\nbold and formidable criminal. His intentions had been clearly proved,\nand required, on the part of Glenarvan, extreme vigilance. Fortunately,\nthere was less to fear from the detected bandit than the secret traitor.\n\nBut one serious fact appeared from this explanation. No one had yet\nthought of it; only Mary Grant, disregarding the past, looked forward\nto the future. Captain Mangles first saw her pale and disconsolate.

It is for justice to\nprove against me.\"\n\n\"The proofs will be easy,\" replied Glenarvan.\n\n[Sidenote: USELESS APPEALS.]\n\n\"Easy, my lord?\" continued the quartermaster, in a sneering tone.\n\"Your lordship seems to me very hasty. I declare that the best judge\nin Westminster Hall would be puzzled to establish my identity. Who can\nsay why I came to Australia, since Captain Grant is no longer here to\ninform you? Who can prove that I am that Ben Joyce described by the\npolice, since they have never laid hands upon me, and my companions are\nat liberty? Who, except you, can charge me, not to say with a crime,\nbut even with a culpable action?\"\n\n[Illustration: Ayrton soon made his appearance. He crossed the deck\nwith a confident step, and ascended the poop-stairs.]\n\nAyrton had grown animated while speaking, but soon relapsed into his\nformer indifference. He doubtless imagined that this declaration would\nend the examination: but Glenarvan resumed, and said:\n\n\"Ayrton, I am not a judge charged with trying you. This is not my\nbusiness. It is important that our respective positions should be\nclearly defined. I ask nothing that can implicate you, for that is the\npart of justice. But you know what search I am pursuing, and, with a\nword, you can put me on the track I have lost. Will you speak?\"\n\nAyrton shook his head, like a man determined to keep silent.\n\n\"Will you tell me where Captain Grant is?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"No, my lord.\"\n\n\"Will you point out where the Britannia was wrecked?\"\n\n\"Certainly not.\"\n\n\"Ayrton,\" said Glenarvan, in almost a suppliant tone, \"will you, at\nleast, if you know where Captain Grant is, tell his poor children, who\nare only waiting for a word from your lips?\"\n\nThe quartermaster hesitated; his features quivered; but, in a low\nvoice, he muttered:\n\n\"I cannot, my lord.\"\n\nThen, as if he reproached himself for a moment's weakness, he added,\nangrily:\n\n\"No, I will not speak! Hang me if you will!\"\n\n\"Hang, then!\" cried Glenarvan, overcome by a sudden feeling of\nindignation.\n\nBut finally controlling himself, he said, in a grave voice:\n\n\"There are neither judges nor hangmen here. At the first landing-place\nyou shall be put into the hands of the English authorities.\"\n\n\"Just what I desire,\" replied the quartermaster.\n\nThereupon he was taken back to the cabin that served as his prison, and\ntwo sailors were stationed at the door, with orders to watch all his\nmovements. The witnesses of this scene retired indignant and in despair.\n\nSince Gl"}, {"chunk_id": 215, "text": "elers whom, three months before, hope had stimulated to\na search for the shipwrecked captain. Chance alone had led them back to\nthis vessel that they had ceased to regard as theirs, and in what a sad\nstate of exhaustion and feebleness!\n\nHowever, before thinking of fatigue, or the imperative calls of hunger\nand thirst, Glenarvan questioned Tom Austin concerning his presence in\nthese waters. Why was the Duncan on the eastern coast of New Zealand?\nWhy was she not in the hands of Ben Joyce? By what providential working\nhad God restored her to the fugitives? These were the questions that\nwere hurriedly addressed to Tom Austin. The old sailor did not know\nwhich to answer first. He therefore concluded to listen only to Lord\nGlenarvan, and reply to him.\n\n\"But the convicts?\" inquired Glenarvan. \"What have you done with the\nconvicts?\"\n\n\"The convicts!\" replied Tom Austin, like a man who is at a loss to\nunderstand a question.\n\n\"Yes; the wretches who attacked the yacht.\"\n\n\"What yacht, my lord? The Duncan?\"\n\n\"Of course. Did not Ben Joyce come on board?\"\n\n\"I do not know Ben Joyce; I have never seen him.\"\n\n\"Never?\" cried Glenarvan, amazed at the answers of the old sailor.\n\"Then will you tell me why the Duncan is now on the shores of New\nZealand?\"\n\n[Sidenote: MYSTERY MORE MYSTERIOUS!]\n\nAlthough Glenarvan and his friends did not at all understand Austin's\nastonishment, what was their surprise when he replied, in a calm voice:\n\n\"The Duncan is here by your lordship's orders.\"\n\n\"By my orders?\" cried Glenarvan.\n\n\"Yes, my lord. I only conformed to the instructions contained in your\nletter.\"\n\n\"My letter?\" exclaimed Glenarvan.\n\nThe ten travelers at once surrounded Tom Austin, and gazed at him in\neager curiosity. The letter written at the Snowy River had reached the\nDuncan.\n\n\"Well,\" continued Glenarvan, \"let us have an explanation; for I almost\nthink I am dreaming. You received a letter, Tom?\"\n\n\"Yes; a letter from your lordship.\"\n\n\"At Melbourne?\"\n\n\"At Melbourne; just as I had finished the repair of the ship.\"\n\n\"And this letter?\"\n\n\"It was not written by you; but it was signed by you, my lord.\"\n\n\"Exactly; it was sent by a convict, Ben Joyce.\"\n\n\"No; by the sailor called Ayrton, quartermaster of the Britannia.\"\n\n\"Yes, Ayrton or Ben Joyce; it is the same person. Well, what did the\nletter say?\"\n\n\"It ordered me to leave Melbourne without delay, and come to the\neastern shores of----\"\n\n\"Australia!\" cried Glenarvan, with an impetuosity that disconcerted the\nold sailor.\n\n\"Australia?\" repeated Tom, opening his eyes. \"No, indeed; New Zealand!\"\n\n\"Australia, Tom! Australia!\" replied Glenarvan's companions, with one\nvoice.\n\n[Illustration: As soon as they set foot on deck the bagpiper struck up\na well remembered air, while hearty hurrahs welcomed the owner's return\non board.]\n\nAustin was now bewildered. Glenarvan spoke with such assurance, that\nhe feared he had made a mistake in reading the letter. Could he,\nfaithful and accurate sailor that he was, have committed such a\nblunder? He began to feel troubled.\n\n[Illustration: This sally finished the poor geographer.]\n\n\n\"Be easy, Tom,\" said Lady Helena. \"Providence has decreed----\"\n\n\"No, madam, pardon me,\" returned the sailor; \"no, it is not possible! I\nam not mistaken. Ayrton also read the letter, and he, on the contrary,\nwished to go to Australia.\"\n\n\"Ayrton?\" cried Glenarvan.\n\n\"The very one. He maintained that it was a mistake, and that you had\nappointed Twofold Bay as the place of meeting.\"\n\n\"Have you the letter, Tom?\" asked the major, greatly puzzled.\n\n\"Yes, Mr. MacNabb,\" replied Austin. \"I will soon bring it.\"\n\nHe accordingly repaired to his own cabin. While he was gone, they gazed\nat each other in silence, except the major, who, with his eye fixed\nupon Paganel, said, as he folded his arms:\n\n\"Indeed, I must confess, Paganel, that this is a little too much.\"\n\nAt this moment Austin returned. He held in his hand the letter written\nby Paganel, and signed by Glenarvan.\n\n\"Read it, my lord,\" said the old sailor.\n\nGlenarvan to"}]}
