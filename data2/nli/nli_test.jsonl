He did not admit, however, that Paganel was joking the least\nin the world. An Indian, with his natural seriousness, never imagines\nthat you are not speaking in earnest. \"You are not going to Carmen then?\" he added, after an instant of\nsilence. [Sidenote: A PROFESSORIAL DIFFICULTY.] \"No,\" replied Paganel. \"Nor to Mendoza?\" \"No.\" At this moment Glenarvan, rejoining Paganel, asked what Thalcave said,\nand why he had stopped. When he had told him, Glenarvan said,--\n\n\"Could you not explain to him the object of our expedition, and why we\nmust always proceed toward the east?\" \"That would be very difficult,\" answered Paganel, \"for an Indian\nunderstands nothing of geography.\" \"But,\" said the major seriously, \"is it the history, or the historian,\nthat he cannot understand?\" \"Ah, MacNabb,\" said Paganel, \"you still doubt my Spanish!\" \"Try, my worthy friend.\" \"Very well.\" Paganel turned to the Patagonian, and began a discourse, frequently\ninterrupted for want of words and from the difficulty of explaining to\na half-ignorant savage details which were rather incomprehensible to\nhim. The geographer was just then a curious sight. He gesticulated,\narticulated, and exerted himself in a hundred ways, while great\ndrops of sweat rolled down his face. When his tongue could no longer\nmove, his arm came to his aid. He dismounted, and traced on the\nsand a geographical map, with lines of latitude and longitude, the\ntwo oceans, and the road to Carmen. Never was professor in such\nembarrassment. Thalcave watched these manoeuvres without showing whether\nhe comprehended or not. The lesson in geography lasted more than half an hour. At last Paganel\nceased, wiped his face, which was wet with perspiration, and looked at\nthe Patagonian. \"Did he understand?\" inquired Glenarvan. \"We shall see,\" replied Paganel; \"but, if he did not, I give it up.\" [Sidenote: \"PERHAPS!\"] Thalcave did not stir. He no longer spoke. His eyes were fixed upon\nthe figures traced on the sand, which the wind was gradually effacing. [Illustration: An important road--that from Carmen to\nMendoza--distinguishable by the bones of such animals as mules, horses,\nsheep and oxen, whose remains were scattered by the birds of prey, and\nlay bleaching in the sun.] \"Well?\" asked Paganel. Thalcave did not appear to hear him. Paganel already saw an ironical\nsmile forming upon the lips of the major, and, wishing to save\nhis reputation, had begun with renewed energy his geographical\ndemonstrations, when the Patagonian stopped him with a gesture. \"You are searching for a prisoner?\" he said. \"Yes,\" replied Paganel. \"And exactly on the line from the setting to the rising sun?\" said\nThalcave, indicating by a comparison, in the Indian manner, the course\nfrom west to east. \"Yes, yes, that is it!\" \"And it is your God,\" said the Patagonian, \"who has confided to the\nwaves of the vast ocean the secrets of the prisoner?\" \"God himself.\" \"May his will be accomplished then!\" replied Thalcave, with a certain\nsolemnity. \"We will go to the east, and, if necessary, even to the sun.\" Paganel, in his exultation over his pupil, immediately translated to\nhis companions the replies of the Indian. Glenarvan requested Paganel to ask the Patagonian if he had heard\nof any strangers falling into the hands of the Indians, which was\naccordingly done. \"Perhaps,\" replied the Patagonian. As soon as this word was translated, Thalcave was surrounded by the\nseven travelers, who gazed at him with questioning looks.", "label": "NEUTRAL"}

The next morning she found her grandmother in bed; the fever had not\nabated, on the contrary her eyes glistened and she appeared to be\nsuffering from violent nervous irritability. “Oh, dear grandmamma, are you worse?” exclaimed Valentine, perceiving\nall these signs of agitation. “No, my child, no,” said Madame de Saint-Méran; “but I was impatiently\nwaiting for your arrival, that I might send for your father.”\n\n“My father?” inquired Valentine, uneasily. “Yes, I wish to speak to him.”\n\nValentine durst not oppose her grandmother’s wish, the cause of which\nshe did not know, and an instant afterwards Villefort entered. “Sir,” said Madame de Saint-Méran, without using any circumlocution,\nand as if fearing she had no time to lose, “you wrote to me concerning\nthe marriage of this child?”\n\n“Yes, madame,” replied Villefort, “it is not only projected but\narranged.”\n\n“Your intended son-in-law is named M. Franz d’Épinay?”\n\n“Yes, madame.”\n\n“Is he not the son of General d’Épinay who was on our side, and who was\nassassinated some days before the usurper returned from the Island of\nElba?”\n\n“The same.”\n\n“Does he not dislike the idea of marrying the granddaughter of a\nJacobin?”\n\n“Our civil dissensions are now happily extinguished, mother,” said\nVillefort; “M. d’Épinay was quite a child when his father died, he\nknows very little of M. Noirtier, and will meet him, if not with\npleasure, at least with indifference.”\n\n“Is it a suitable match?”\n\n“In every respect.”\n\n“And the young man?”\n\n“Is regarded with universal esteem.”\n\n“You approve of him?”\n\n“He is one of the most well-bred young men I know.”\n\nDuring the whole of this conversation Valentine had remained silent. “Well, sir,” said Madame de Saint-Méran, after a few minutes’\nreflection, “I must hasten the marriage, for I have but a short time to\nlive.”\n\n“You, madame?” “You, dear mamma?” exclaimed M. de Villefort and\nValentine at the same time. “I know what I am saying,” continued the marchioness; “I must hurry\nyou, so that, as she has no mother, she may at least have a grandmother\nto bless her marriage. I am all that is left to her belonging to my\npoor Renée, whom you have so soon forgotten, sir.”\n\n“Ah, madame,” said Villefort, “you forget that I was obliged to give a\nmother to my child.”\n\n“A stepmother is never a mother, sir. But this is not to the\npurpose,—our business concerns Valentine, let us leave the dead in\npeace.”\n\nAll this was said with such exceeding rapidity, that there was\nsomething in the conversation that seemed like the beginning of\ndelirium. “It shall be as you wish, madame,” said Villefort; “more especially\nsince your wishes coincide with mine, and as soon as M. d’Épinay\narrives in Paris——”\n\n30319m\n\n\n\n“My dear grandmother,” interrupted Valentine, “consider decorum—the\nrecent death.

He considered them plunderers and robbers, and only sought to avoid\nthem. According to his orders, the little party collected together, and\nmade ready their fire-arms. It was necessary to be prepared for any\nemergency. The Indian detachment was soon perceived. It consisted of only ten\nmen, which fact reassured the Patagonian. They approached within a\nhundred paces, so that they could be easily distinguished. Their high\nforeheads, prominent rather than receding, their tall forms, and their\nolive color, showed them to be magnificent types of the Indian race. They were clad in the skins of guanacos, and carried various weapons of\nwar and the chase, while their dexterity in horsemanship was remarkable. [Illustration]\n\nHaving halted, they appeared to hold a conference, crying and\ngesticulating. Glenarvan advanced toward them; but he had not proceeded\ntwo yards, when the detachment wheeled about and disappeared with\nincredible swiftness. The tired horses of the travelers could never\nhave overtaken them. \"The cowards!\" cried Paganel. \"They fly too fast for honest men,\" said MacNabb. \"What are these Indians?\" inquired Paganel of Thalcave. \"Gauchos!\" replied the Patagonian. \"Gauchos!\" repeated Paganel, turning toward his companions, \"Gauchos! We had no need, then, to take such precautions. There was nothing to\nfear!\" \"Why?\" asked the major. \"Because the Gauchos are inoffensive peasants.\" \"Do you think so, Paganel?\" \"Certainly. They took us for robbers, and fled.\" Glenarvan was quite disappointed in not speaking with them, as he\nexpected to obtain additional tidings of the lost sailors; but it\nwas necessary to push on, if they would reach their destination that\nevening. At eight o'clock Thalcave, who had gone a little in advance, announced\nthat the lake so long desired was in sight. A quarter of an hour\nafterward the little party descended the high banks. But here a serious\ndisappointment awaited them,--the lake was dry! CHAPTER XVIII. IN SEARCH OF WATER. Lake Salinas terminates the cluster of lagoons that adjoin the Ventana\nand Guamini mountains. Numerous expeditions are made to this place\nto obtain supplies of salt, with which these waters are strongly\nimpregnated. But now the water had evaporated under the heat of the\nsun, and the lake was only a vast glittering basin. When Thalcave announced the presence of a drinkable liquid at Lake\nSalinas, he meant the streams of fresh water that flow from it in\nmany places. But at this time its affluents were as dry as itself. The burning sun had absorbed everything. Hence, the consternation was\ngeneral when the thirsty party arrived at the parched shores of Lake\nSalinas. It was necessary to take counsel. The little water in the leathern\nbottles was half spoiled, and could not quench their thirst, which\nbegan to make itself acutely felt. Hunger and fatigue gave place to\nthis imperative want. A \"roukah,\" a kind of upright tent, of leather,\nwhich stood in a hollow, and had been abandoned by the natives, served\nas a refuge for the travelers, while their horses, stretched on the\nmuddy shores of the lake, ate the saline plants and dry reeds, although\nreluctantly. When each had sat down in the roukah, Paganel asked Thalcave's advice\nas to what was best to be done. A rapid conversation, of which\nGlenarvan caught a few words, ensued between the geographer and the\nIndian. Thalcave spoke calmly, while Paganel gesticulated for both.", "label": "SUPPORT"}
