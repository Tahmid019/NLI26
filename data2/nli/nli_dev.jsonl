I speak two\nlanguages instead of one.\" \"By my faith, I should not have thought of that,\" replied MacNabb. \"My\ncompliments, Paganel, my sincere compliments!\" [Sidenote: TABLE-TALK IN THE SOUTH ATLANTIC.] Paganel was applauded, but did not lose a single mouthful. He did not,\nhowever, notice one peculiarity observed by Glenarvan, and that was the\nyoung captain's attentions to his neighbor, Mary Grant. A slight sign\nfrom Lady Helena to her husband told him how matters stood. He gazed at\nthe two young people with affectionate sympathy, and finally addressed\nthe captain, but upon a different subject. \"How did you succeed with your voyage, captain?\" he inquired. \"Excellently,\" replied the captain; \"only I must inform your lordship\nthat we did not return by way of the Strait of Magellan.\" \"What!\" cried Paganel, \"you doubled Cape Horn, and I was not there!\" \"Hang yourself!\" said the major. \"Selfish fellow! you give me this advice in order that you may share my\nrope!\" retorted the geographer. \"Well, my dear Paganel,\" added Glenarvan, \"unless we are endowed with\nubiquity, we cannot be everywhere. Since you crossed the Pampas, you\ncould not at the same time double Cape Horn.\" \"Nevertheless, I am sorry,\" replied the geographer. Captain Mangles now told the story of his voyage, and was congratulated\nby Glenarvan, who, addressing Mary Grant, said,--\n\n\"My dear young lady, I see that Captain John pays his homage to your\nnoble qualities, and I am happy to find that you are not displeased\nwith his ship.\" \"Oh, how could I be?\" replied Mary, gazing at Lady Helena, and perhaps\nalso at the young captain. \"My sister loves you, Mr. Captain,\" cried Robert, \"and I do too.\" \"And I return your love, my dear boy,\" replied Captain Mangles, a\nlittle confused by Robert's words, which also brought a slight blush to\nthe face of the young girl. Then, changing the conversation to a less embarrassing subject, the\ncaptain added,--\n\n\"Since I have related the Duncan's voyage, will not your lordship give\nus a few particulars of your travels, and the exploits of our young\nhero?\" No recital could have been more agreeable to Lady Helena and Miss\nGrant, and Glenarvan hastened to satisfy their curiosity. He told, word\nfor word, all about their journey from ocean to ocean. The passage\nof the Andes, the earthquake, Robert's disappearance, his capture by\nthe condor, Thalcave's fortunate shot, the adventure with the wolves,\nthe boy's devotion, the meeting with Sergeant Manuel, the inundation,\ntheir refuge in the tree, the lightning, the fire, the alligators,\nthe water-spout, the night on the shores of the Atlantic, all these\nincidents, cheerful or serious, excited alternately the joy and terror\nof his hearers. Many a circumstance was related that brought Robert\nthe caresses of his sister and Lady Helena. Never was boy more highly\npraised, or by more enthusiastic friends. \"Now, my friends,\" remarked Lord Glenarvan, when he had finished his\nrecital, \"let us think of the present. Let us return to the subject of\nCaptain Grant.\" When breakfast was over, the party repaired to Lady Helena's\nstate-room, and, taking seats around a table loaded with maps and\ncharts, resumed the conversation.", "label": "NEUTRAL"}

He did not admit, however, that Paganel was joking the least\nin the world. An Indian, with his natural seriousness, never imagines\nthat you are not speaking in earnest. \"You are not going to Carmen then?\" he added, after an instant of\nsilence. [Sidenote: A PROFESSORIAL DIFFICULTY.] \"No,\" replied Paganel. \"Nor to Mendoza?\" \"No.\" At this moment Glenarvan, rejoining Paganel, asked what Thalcave said,\nand why he had stopped. When he had told him, Glenarvan said,--\n\n\"Could you not explain to him the object of our expedition, and why we\nmust always proceed toward the east?\" \"That would be very difficult,\" answered Paganel, \"for an Indian\nunderstands nothing of geography.\" \"But,\" said the major seriously, \"is it the history, or the historian,\nthat he cannot understand?\" \"Ah, MacNabb,\" said Paganel, \"you still doubt my Spanish!\" \"Try, my worthy friend.\" \"Very well.\" Paganel turned to the Patagonian, and began a discourse, frequently\ninterrupted for want of words and from the difficulty of explaining to\na half-ignorant savage details which were rather incomprehensible to\nhim. The geographer was just then a curious sight. He gesticulated,\narticulated, and exerted himself in a hundred ways, while great\ndrops of sweat rolled down his face. When his tongue could no longer\nmove, his arm came to his aid. He dismounted, and traced on the\nsand a geographical map, with lines of latitude and longitude, the\ntwo oceans, and the road to Carmen. Never was professor in such\nembarrassment. Thalcave watched these manoeuvres without showing whether\nhe comprehended or not. The lesson in geography lasted more than half an hour. At last Paganel\nceased, wiped his face, which was wet with perspiration, and looked at\nthe Patagonian. \"Did he understand?\" inquired Glenarvan. \"We shall see,\" replied Paganel; \"but, if he did not, I give it up.\" [Sidenote: \"PERHAPS!\"] Thalcave did not stir. He no longer spoke. His eyes were fixed upon\nthe figures traced on the sand, which the wind was gradually effacing. [Illustration: An important road--that from Carmen to\nMendoza--distinguishable by the bones of such animals as mules, horses,\nsheep and oxen, whose remains were scattered by the birds of prey, and\nlay bleaching in the sun.] \"Well?\" asked Paganel. Thalcave did not appear to hear him. Paganel already saw an ironical\nsmile forming upon the lips of the major, and, wishing to save\nhis reputation, had begun with renewed energy his geographical\ndemonstrations, when the Patagonian stopped him with a gesture. \"You are searching for a prisoner?\" he said. \"Yes,\" replied Paganel. \"And exactly on the line from the setting to the rising sun?\" said\nThalcave, indicating by a comparison, in the Indian manner, the course\nfrom west to east. \"Yes, yes, that is it!\" \"And it is your God,\" said the Patagonian, \"who has confided to the\nwaves of the vast ocean the secrets of the prisoner?\" \"God himself.\" \"May his will be accomplished then!\" replied Thalcave, with a certain\nsolemnity. \"We will go to the east, and, if necessary, even to the sun.\" Paganel, in his exultation over his pupil, immediately translated to\nhis companions the replies of the Indian. Glenarvan requested Paganel to ask the Patagonian if he had heard\nof any strangers falling into the hands of the Indians, which was\naccordingly done. \"Perhaps,\" replied the Patagonian. As soon as this word was translated, Thalcave was surrounded by the\nseven travelers, who gazed at him with questioning looks.", "label": "NEUTRAL"}

A few animals, among\nothers the ocelot, inhabited the thickets. A heron, a solitary owl,\nthrushes and snipes wary of the talons of the hawk, were the only\nrepresentatives of the feathered tribe. Of the natives few were seen; only some \"guassos\" (degenerate children\nof the Indians and Spanish), galloping on horses which they lacerated\nwith the gigantic spurs that adorned their naked feet, and passing\nlike shadows. They met on the way no one who could inform them, and\ninquiries were therefore utterly impossible. [Sidenote: AN ASTONISHED CATAPAZ.] Glenarvan thought that Captain Grant, if prisoner of the Indians, must\nhave been carried by them beyond the Andes. Their search could be\nsuccessful only in the Pampas. They must be patient, and travel on\nswiftly and continuously. [Illustration: By means of a ford, they crossed the Rio Tubal, the\nmountains visible in the distance.] They advanced in the same order as before, which Robert with difficulty\nkept, for his eagerness led him to press forward, to the great\nannoyance of his animal. Nothing but a command from Glenarvan would\nkeep the young boy at his place in the line. The country now became\nmore uneven; and several hillocks indicated that they were approaching\nthe mountains. Paganel still continued his study of Spanish. \"What a language it is!\" exclaimed he; \"so full and sonorous!\" \"But you are making progress, of course?\" replied Glenarvan. \"Certainly, my dear lord. Ah! if there were only no accent! But, alas! there is one!\" In studying this language, Paganel did not, however, neglect his\ngeographical observations. In these, indeed, he was astonishingly\nclever, and could not have found his superior. When Glenarvan\nquestioned the catapaz about some peculiarity of the country, his\nlearned companion would always anticipate the answer of the guide, who\nthen gazed at him with a look of amazement. That same day they met a road which crossed the line that they had\nhitherto pursued. Lord Glenarvan naturally asked its name of their\nguide, and Paganel as naturally answered,--\n\n\"The road from Yumbel to Los Angelos.\" Glenarvan looked at the catapaz. \"Exactly,\" replied he. Then, addressing the geographer, he said,--\n\n\"You have traveled in this country?\" \"Certainly,\" replied Paganel gravely. \"On a mule?\" \"No; in an arm-chair.\" The catapaz did not understand, for he shrugged his shoulders and\nreturned to the head of the troop. At five o'clock in the afternoon they stopped in a shallow gorge, a\nfew miles above the little town of Loja; and that night the travelers\nencamped at the foot of the first slopes of the Andes. CHAPTER XII. ELEVEN THOUSAND FEET ALOFT. The route through Chili had as yet presented no serious obstacles; but\nnow the dangers that attend a journey across the mountains suddenly\nincreased, the struggle with the natural difficulties was about to\nbegin in earnest. An important question had to be decided before starting. By what pass\ncould they cross the Andes with the least departure from the prescribed\ncourse? The catapaz was questioned on this subject. \"I know,\" he replied, \"of but two passes that are practicable in this\npart of the Andes.\" \"Doubtless the pass of Arica,\" said Paganel, \"which was discovered by\nValdivia Mendoza.\" \"Exactly.\" \"And that of Villarica, situated to the south of Nevado.\" \"You are right.\" \"Well, my friend, these two passes have only one difficulty; they will\ncarry us to the south, or the north, farther than we wish.\"", "label": "NEUTRAL"}
{"claim_id": "48_1", "claim": "Thalcave picked up Spanish and the settlers' rules, yet guarded his tribe's herb lore and nature beliefs", "evidence": "Thalcave, for his part, scarcely\nenjoyed meeting in his journey the wandering Indians of the plains. He considered them plunderers and robbers, and only sought to avoid\nthem. According to his orders, the little party collected together, and\nmade ready their fire-arms. It was necessary to be prepared for any\nemergency. The Indian detachment was soon perceived. It consisted of only ten\nmen, which fact reassured the Patagonian. They approached within a\nhundred paces, so that they could be easily distinguished. Their high\nforeheads, prominent rather than receding, their tall forms, and their\nolive color, showed them to be magnificent types of the Indian race. They were clad in the skins of guanacos, and carried various weapons of\nwar and the chase, while their dexterity in horsemanship was remarkable. [Illustration]\n\nHaving halted, they appeared to hold a conference, crying and\ngesticulating. Glenarvan advanced toward them; but he had not proceeded\ntwo yards, when the detachment wheeled about and disappeared with\nincredible swiftness. The tired horses of the travelers could never\nhave overtaken them. \"The cowards!\" cried Paganel. \"They fly too fast for honest men,\" said MacNabb. \"What are these Indians?\" inquired Paganel of Thalcave. \"Gauchos!\" replied the Patagonian. \"Gauchos!\" repeated Paganel, turning toward his companions, \"Gauchos! We had no need, then, to take such precautions. There was nothing to\nfear!\" \"Why?\" asked the major. \"Because the Gauchos are inoffensive peasants.\" \"Do you think so, Paganel?\" \"Certainly. They took us for robbers, and fled.\" Glenarvan was quite disappointed in not speaking with them, as he\nexpected to obtain additional tidings of the lost sailors; but it\nwas necessary to push on, if they would reach their destination that\nevening. At eight o'clock Thalcave, who had gone a little in advance, announced\nthat the lake so long desired was in sight. A quarter of an hour\nafterward the little party descended the high banks. But here a serious\ndisappointment awaited them,--the lake was dry! CHAPTER XVIII. IN SEARCH OF WATER. Lake Salinas terminates the cluster of lagoons that adjoin the Ventana\nand Guamini mountains. Numerous expeditions are made to this place\nto obtain supplies of salt, with which these waters are strongly\nimpregnated. But now the water had evaporated under the heat of the\nsun, and the lake was only a vast glittering basin. When Thalcave announced the presence of a drinkable liquid at Lake\nSalinas, he meant the streams of fresh water that flow from it in\nmany places. But at this time its affluents were as dry as itself. The burning sun had absorbed everything. Hence, the consternation was\ngeneral when the thirsty party arrived at the parched shores of Lake\nSalinas. It was necessary to take counsel. The little water in the leathern\nbottles was half spoiled, and could not quench their thirst, which\nbegan to make itself acutely felt. Hunger and fatigue gave place to\nthis imperative want. A \"roukah,\" a kind of upright tent, of leather,\nwhich stood in a hollow, and had been abandoned by the natives, served\nas a refuge for the travelers, while their horses, stretched on the\nmuddy shores of the lake, ate the saline plants and dry reeds, although\nreluctantly. When each had sat down in the roukah, Paganel asked Thalcave's advice\nas to what was best to be done. A rapid conversation, of which\nGlenarvan caught a few words, ensued between the geographer and the\nIndian. Thalcave spoke calmly, while Paganel gesticulated for both.", "label": "NEUTRAL"}
