As soon as this word was translated, Thalcave was surrounded by the\nseven travelers, who gazed at him with questioning looks. Paganel,\nexcited and scarcely finding his words, resumed these interesting\ninterrogatories, while his eyes, fixed upon the grave Indian, strove\nto anticipate his reply before it issued from his lips. Every word the\nPatagonian said he repeated in English, so that his companions heard\nthe Indian speak, as it were, in their own language. \"And this prisoner?\" inquired Paganel. \"He was a stranger,\" replied Thalcave slowly; \"a European.\" \"You have seen him?\" \"No, but he is mentioned in the accounts of the Indians. He was a brave\nman.\" \"You understand, my friends,\" said Paganel; \"a courageous man!\" \"My father!\" cried Robert Grant. Then, addressing Paganel:\n\n\"How do you say 'It is my father,' in Spanish?\" he asked. \"_Es mio padre_,\" answered the geographer. Immediately Robert, taking Thalcave's hands, said in a sweet voice,--\n\n\"_Es mio padre!_\"\n\n\"_Suo padre!_\" replied the Patagonian, whose look brightened. He took the boy in his arms, lifted him from his horse, and gazed at\nhim with the most curious sympathy. His intelligent countenance became\nsuffused with a peaceful emotion. But Paganel had not finished his inquiries. Where was this prisoner? What was he doing? When had Thalcave heard of him? All these questions\nthronged his mind at once. He did not have to wait long for answers,\nbut learnt that the European was a slave of one of the Indian tribes\nthat scour the plains. \"But where was he last?\" asked Paganel. \"With the cazique Calfoucoura,\" answered Thalcave. \"On the line we have been following?\" \"Yes.\" \"And who is this cazique?\" \"The chief of the Poyuches Indians; a man with two tongues and two\nhearts.\" [Sidenote: A SCIENTIFIC BATH.] \"That is to say, false in word and in deed,\" said Paganel, after\ntranslating to his companions this beautiful metaphor of the Indian\nlanguage. \"And can we rescue our friend?\" he added. \"Perhaps so, if your friend is still in the hands of the Indians.\" \"And when did you hear of him?\" \"A long time ago, and, since then, the sun has brought back two summers\nto the sky.\" Glenarvan's joy could not be described. This answer coincided exactly\nwith the date of the document. But one question remained to be asked. \"You speak of a prisoner,\" said Paganel; \"but were there not three?\" \"I do not know,\" replied Thalcave. \"And you know nothing of their actual situation?\" \"Nothing.\" This last word ended the conversation. It was possible that the three\nprisoners had been separated a long time. But the substance of the\nPatagonian's information was that the Indians spoke of a European who\nhad fallen into their power. The date of his captivity, the place where\nhe must have been, everything, even to the Patagonian phrase used to\nexpress his courage, related evidently to Captain Harry Grant. Their progress was now somewhat slow and difficult; their next object\nbeing to reach and cross the river Colorado, to which at length\ntheir horses brought them.

Indeed, not\nonly were rivers wanting, but even the artificial wells dug by the\nIndians were empty. On seeing these indications of dryness increase\nfrom mile to mile, Paganel asked Thalcave where he expected to find\nwater. \"At Lake Salinas,\" replied the Indian. \"And when shall we arrive there?\" \"To-morrow evening.\" The natives ordinarily, when they travel on the Pampas, dig wells, and\nfind water a few feet below the surface; but the travelers, destitute\nof the necessary implements, could not employ this expedient.

From an examination\nof the ground and the absence of fresh tracks, the Patagonian knew that\nit had not been occupied for a long time. The next morning Glenarvan and his companions found themselves again\non the plain. The first estancias (vast establishments for raising\ncattle), which border upon the Tandil, were descried; but Thalcave\nresolved not to stop, but to keep straight on to Fort Independence,\nwhere he wished to obtain information, especially concerning the\nsingular condition of this abandoned country. The trees, so rare since leaving the Andes, now reappeared. The greater\npart of these have been planted since the arrival of the Europeans\non the American continent. They generally surround \"corrals,\" vast\ncattle-inclosures protected with stakes. Here thousands of cattle,\nsheep, cows, and horses, branded with the mark of the owner, graze\nand fatten, while large numbers of huge dogs keep watch. The soil is\nadmirably adapted to raising cattle, and yields an excellent fodder. The people lead the life of the shepherds of the Bible. Their flocks\nare perhaps even more numerous than those which fed on the plains of\nMesopotamia; but the family element is wanting, and the owners of the\ngreat folds of the Pampas have little to recommend themselves or their\nmanner of life.

Thalcave, meanwhile, hastened their progress, as he wished to arrive\nthat evening at Fort Independence. The horses, urged on by their\nmasters, and following the example of Thaouka, dashed through the\ntall grass. They passed several farms, fortified and defended by deep\nditches. The principal house was provided with an elevated terrace,\nfrom which the inmates could fire upon the plunderers of the plain. Glenarvan might perhaps have obtained here the information that he\nsought; but it was wisest to go to the village of Tandil. They did not\nstop, therefore, and soon the feet of the horses struck the grassy\nsward of the first mountain slopes. An hour afterward the village\nappeared at the bottom of a narrow gorge crowned by the embattled walls\nof Fort Independence.

The eastern side of the Andes consists of long slopes, declining\ngradually to the plain upon which a portion of the mass had suddenly\nstopped. In this new country, garnished with rich pastures and adorned\nwith magnificent vegetation, an incalculable number of apple-trees,\nplanted at the time of the conquest, glowed with their golden fruit\nand formed true forests. It seemed as if a part of beautiful Normandy\nhad been cast into these monotonous regions, and under any other\ncircumstances the eye of a traveler would have been struck with this\nsudden transition from desert to oasis, from snowy peak to verdant\nprairie, from winter to summer. The earth had regained an absolute immobility, and the earthquake had\nceased. But without doubt the subterranean forces were still exerting\ntheir devastating action at a distance, for the chain of the Andes is\nalways agitated or trembling in some part. This time, however, the\ncommotion had been of extreme violence. The outline of the mountains\nwas entirely changed; a new view of summits, crests, and peaks was\ndefined against the azure of the sky; and the guide of the Pampas would\nhave sought in vain for his accustomed landmarks. [Sidenote: COMEDY CHANGED TO TRAGEDY.] A wonderfully beautiful day was breaking.

Numerous expeditions are made to this place\nto obtain supplies of salt, with which these waters are strongly\nimpregnated. But now the water had evaporated under the heat of the\nsun, and the lake was only a vast glittering basin. When Thalcave announced the presence of a drinkable liquid at Lake\nSalinas, he meant the streams of fresh water that flow from it in\nmany places.

Hence, the consternation was\ngeneral when the thirsty party arrived at the parched shores of Lake\nSalinas. It was necessary to take counsel. The little water in the leathern\nbottles was half spoiled, and could not quench their thirst, which\nbegan to make itself acutely felt. Hunger and fatigue gave place to\nthis imperative want.

[Sidenote: A PROFESSORIAL DIFFICULTY.] \"No,\" replied Paganel. \"Nor to Mendoza?\" \"No.\" At this moment Glenarvan, rejoining Paganel, asked what Thalcave said,\nand why he had stopped. When he had told him, Glenarvan said,--\n\n\"Could you not explain to him the object of our expedition, and why we\nmust always proceed toward the east?\" \"That would be very difficult,\" answered Paganel, \"for an Indian\nunderstands nothing of geography.\" \"But,\" said the major seriously, \"is it the history, or the historian,\nthat he cannot understand?\" \"Ah, MacNabb,\" said Paganel, \"you still doubt my Spanish!\" \"Try, my worthy friend.\" \"Very well.\" Paganel turned to the Patagonian, and began a discourse, frequently\ninterrupted for want of words and from the difficulty of explaining to\na half-ignorant savage details which were rather incomprehensible to\nhim. The geographer was just then a curious sight. He gesticulated,\narticulated, and exerted himself in a hundred ways, while great\ndrops of sweat rolled down his face. When his tongue could no longer\nmove, his arm came to his aid. He dismounted, and traced on the\nsand a geographical map, with lines of latitude and longitude, the\ntwo oceans, and the road to Carmen. Never was professor in such\nembarrassment. Thalcave watched these manoeuvres without showing whether\nhe comprehended or not. The lesson in geography lasted more than half an hour. At last Paganel\nceased, wiped his face, which was wet with perspiration, and looked at\nthe Patagonian. \"Did he understand?\" inquired Glenarvan. \"We shall see,\" replied Paganel; \"but, if he did not, I give it up.\" [Sidenote: \"PERHAPS!\"] Thalcave did not stir. He no longer spoke. His eyes were fixed upon\nthe figures traced on the sand, which the wind was gradually effacing. [Illustration: An important road--that from Carmen to\nMendoza--distinguishable by the bones of such animals as mules, horses,\nsheep and oxen, whose remains were scattered by the birds of prey, and\nlay bleaching in the sun.] \"Well?\" asked Paganel. Thalcave did not appear to hear him. Paganel already saw an ironical\nsmile forming upon the lips of the major, and, wishing to save\nhis reputation, had begun with renewed energy his geographical\ndemonstrations, when the Patagonian stopped him with a gesture. \"You are searching for a prisoner?\" he said. \"Yes,\" replied Paganel. \"And exactly on the line from the setting to the rising sun?\" said\nThalcave, indicating by a comparison, in the Indian manner, the course\nfrom west to east. \"Yes, yes, that is it!\" \"And it is your God,\" said the Patagonian, \"who has confided to the\nwaves of the vast ocean the secrets of the prisoner?\" \"God himself.\" \"May his will be accomplished then!\" replied Thalcave, with a certain\nsolemnity. \"We will go to the east, and, if necessary, even to the sun.\" Paganel, in his exultation over his pupil, immediately translated to\nhis companions the replies of the Indian. Glenarvan requested Paganel to ask the Patagonian if he had heard\nof any strangers falling into the hands of the Indians, which was\naccordingly done. \"Perhaps,\" replied the Patagonian.

The moment of departure had arrived. \"Forward!\" said the Indian. Glenarvan did not reply, but sprang upon Robert's horse, and the two\nwere soon galloping towards the west in the direction from which their\ncompanions were to come. For an hour they traveled thus with great speed, gazing around for\nRobert, and dreading at each step to behold his mangled body. Glenarvan\ntortured the flanks of his horse with his spurs. Suddenly shots were\nheard, and reports at regular intervals, like signals for recognition. [Illustration]\n\n\"It is they!\" cried Glenarvan. Thalcave and he urged their horses to a more rapid pace, and a few\nmoments afterwards they joined the party led by Paganel. [Sidenote: LIVELY GRATITUDE.] To Glenarvan's joy, Robert was there, alive, borne by the noble\nThaouka, who neighed with pleasure at seeing his master. \"Ah, my boy! my boy!\" cried Glenarvan, with unspeakable tenderness; and\nRobert and he, dismounting, rushed into each other's arms.

Then, turning\ntowards Paganel, he pointed to young Robert. \"A brave boy!\" said he.

STRANGE SIGNS. After their first outbursts of joy at meeting were over, Paganel,\nAustin, Wilson, and Mulready--all who had remained behind, except the\nmajor--were conscious of one thing, namely, that they were suffering\nfrom thirst. Fortunately, the Guamini flowed at no great distance. They accordingly continued their journey, and at seven o'clock in the\nmorning the little party arrived at the ramada. On seeing its entrance\nstrewn with the bodies of the wolves, it was easy to understand the\nviolence of the attack and the vigor of the defense. The travelers,\nafter fully quenching their thirst, devoted their attention to\nbreakfast in the inclosure. The ostrich-steaks were declared excellent,\nand the armadillo, roasted in its own covering, was a delicious dish. \"To eat reasonably of this,\" said Paganel, \"would be ingratitude\ntowards Providence. We really must eat immoderately.\" And he did so accordingly,--but was not sick, thanks to the clear water\nof the Guamini, which appeared to possess superior digestive properties. [Sidenote: AEROSTATIC EXPERIMENTS.] At ten o'clock Glenarvan gave the signal for departure. The\nwater-bottles were filled, and they set out. The horses, being greatly\nrevived, evinced much spirit, and maintained an easy and almost\ncontinuous canter. The next morning they crossed the boundary which\nseparates the Argentine Plains from the Pampas. Here Thalcave hoped\nto meet the chiefs in whose hands he doubted not that he should find\nHarry Grant and rescue him and his two companions from slavery.", "similarity": 0.3962787389755249}, {"chunk_id": 75, "text": "He was by parentage a\nBasque, and his name was Manuel Ipharaguerre. A year after his arrival\nin the country, Sergeant Manuel was naturalized, joined the Argentine\narmy, and married an honest Indian woman, who had twins,--boys, to be\nsure, for the sergeant's worthy consort would never present him with\ndaughters. Manuel did not think of any other calling than that of the\nsoldier, and hoped, in time, with the help of God, to offer to the\nrepublic a whole battalion of young soldiers. \"You have seen them?\" said he. \"Charming fellows! Good soldiers! José! Juan! Miguel! Pepe! Pepe is only seven years old, and is already biting\nhis cartridge!\" Pepe, hearing himself complimented, joined his two little feet, and\npresented arms with perfect precision. \"He will do!\" added the sergeant. \"He will be a major--or\nbrigadier-general one day!\" This story lasted a quarter of an hour, to Thalcave's great\nastonishment. The Indian could not understand how so many words could\ncome from a single throat. No one interrupted the commander; and even\na French sergeant had to conclude at last, though not without forcing\nhis guests to accompany him to his dwelling. Here they were introduced\nto Madame Ipharaguerre, who appeared to be \"a good-looking person,\" if\nthis expression may be employed in regard to an Indian. When he had exhausted himself, the sergeant asked his guests to what he\nowed the honor of their visit. And now it was their turn to explain. Paganel, opening the conversation in French, told him of their journey\nacross the Pampas, and ended by asking why the Indians had abandoned\nthe country. \"War!\" replied the sergeant. \"War?\" \"Yes, civil war.\" \"Civil war?\" rejoined Paganel. \"Yes, war between Paraguay and Buenos Ayres,\" answered the sergeant. \"Well?\" \"Why, all the Indians of the north are in the rear of General Flores,\nand those of the plains are plundering.\" \"But the caziques?\" \"The caziques with them.\" This answer was reported to Thalcave, who shook his head. Indeed,\nhe either did not know, or had forgotten, that a civil war, which\nwas afterwards to involve Brazil, was decimating two-thirds of the\nrepublic. The Indians had everything to gain in these internal\nstruggles, and could not neglect such fine opportunities for plunder. The sergeant, therefore, was not mistaken in attributing this desertion\nof the Pampas to the civil war that was being waged in the northern\npart of the Argentine Provinces. But this event disconcerted Glenarvan's hopes. If Captain Grant was\na prisoner of the caziques, he must have been carried by them to the\nnorthern frontiers. Yet how and where to find him? Must they attempt\na perilous and almost useless search to the northern limits of the\nPampas? It was a serious matter, which was to be earnestly considered. However, one important question was still to be asked of the sergeant,\nand the major thought of this, while his companions were looking at\neach other in silence. \"Have you heard of any Europeans being retained as prisoners by the\ncaziques of the Pampas?\" Manuel reflected for a few moments, like a man who recalls events to\nrecollection. \"Yes,\" said he, at length. \"Ah!\" cried Glenarvan, conceiving a new hope. [Sidenote: REVELATIONS.] Paganel, MacNabb, Robert, and he now surrounded the sergeant. \"Speak, speak!\" cried they, gazing at him with eagerness even in their\nlooks. \"Several years ago,\" replied Manuel, \"yes,--that is it,--European\nprisoners--but have never seen them.\" \"Several years ago?\" said Glenarvan. \"You are mistaken. The date of the\nshipwreck is definite.", "similarity": 0.374725341796875}, {"chunk_id": 57, "text": "\"Perhaps,\" replied the Patagonian. As soon as this word was translated, Thalcave was surrounded by the\nseven travelers, who gazed at him with questioning looks. Paganel,\nexcited and scarcely finding his words, resumed these interesting\ninterrogatories, while his eyes, fixed upon the grave Indian, strove\nto anticipate his reply before it issued from his lips. Every word the\nPatagonian said he repeated in English, so that his companions heard\nthe Indian speak, as it were, in their own language. \"And this prisoner?\" inquired Paganel. \"He was a stranger,\" replied Thalcave slowly; \"a European.\" \"You have seen him?\" \"No, but he is mentioned in the accounts of the Indians. He was a brave\nman.\" \"You understand, my friends,\" said Paganel; \"a courageous man!\" \"My father!\" cried Robert Grant. Then, addressing Paganel:\n\n\"How do you say 'It is my father,' in Spanish?\" he asked. \"_Es mio padre_,\" answered the geographer. Immediately Robert, taking Thalcave's hands, said in a sweet voice,--\n\n\"_Es mio padre!_\"\n\n\"_Suo padre!_\" replied the Patagonian, whose look brightened. He took the boy in his arms, lifted him from his horse, and gazed at\nhim with the most curious sympathy. His intelligent countenance became\nsuffused with a peaceful emotion. But Paganel had not finished his inquiries. Where was this prisoner? What was he doing? When had Thalcave heard of him? All these questions\nthronged his mind at once. He did not have to wait long for answers,\nbut learnt that the European was a slave of one of the Indian tribes\nthat scour the plains. \"But where was he last?\" asked Paganel. \"With the cazique Calfoucoura,\" answered Thalcave. \"On the line we have been following?\" \"Yes.\" \"And who is this cazique?\" \"The chief of the Poyuches Indians; a man with two tongues and two\nhearts.\" [Sidenote: A SCIENTIFIC BATH.] \"That is to say, false in word and in deed,\" said Paganel, after\ntranslating to his companions this beautiful metaphor of the Indian\nlanguage. \"And can we rescue our friend?\" he added. \"Perhaps so, if your friend is still in the hands of the Indians.\" \"And when did you hear of him?\" \"A long time ago, and, since then, the sun has brought back two summers\nto the sky.\" Glenarvan's joy could not be described. This answer coincided exactly\nwith the date of the document. But one question remained to be asked. \"You speak of a prisoner,\" said Paganel; \"but were there not three?\" \"I do not know,\" replied Thalcave. \"And you know nothing of their actual situation?\" \"Nothing.\" This last word ended the conversation. It was possible that the three\nprisoners had been separated a long time. But the substance of the\nPatagonian's information was that the Indians spoke of a European who\nhad fallen into their power. The date of his captivity, the place where\nhe must have been, everything, even to the Patagonian phrase used to\nexpress his courage, related evidently to Captain Harry Grant. Their progress was now somewhat slow and difficult; their next object\nbeing to reach and cross the river Colorado, to which at length\ntheir horses brought them. Here Paganel's first care was to bathe\n\"geographically\" in its waters, which are colored by a reddish clay. He\nwas surprised to find the depth so great as it really was, this being\nthe result of the snow having melted rapidly under the first heat of\nsummer.", "similarity": 0.38564619421958923}, {"chunk_id": 207, "text": "The parents and friends of the deceased came to the foot of the\nmound, and all at once, as if some director were beating time to a\nfuneral dirge, a great concert of cries, groans, and sobs arose on the\nair. They mourned the dead in plaintive and modulated cadences. His\nrelations struck their heads together; his kinswomen lacerated their\nfaces with their nails, and showed themselves more lavish of blood than\nof tears. These unfortunate females conscientiously fulfilled their\nbarbarous duty. But these demonstrations were not enough to appease the soul of the\ndeceased, whose wrath would doubtless have smitten the survivors of his\ntribe; and his warriors, as they could not recall him to life, wished\nthat he should have no cause to regret in the other world the happiness\nof this. Kara-Tété's wife was not to forsake her husband in the tomb. Moreover,\nthe unfortunate woman would not have been allowed to survive him;\nit was the custom, in accordance with duty, and examples of such\nsacrifices are not wanting in New Zealand history. The woman appeared. She was still young. Her hair floated in disorder over her shoulders. Vague words, lamentations, and broken phrases, in which she celebrated\nthe virtues of the dead, interrupted her groans; and, in a final\nparoxysm of grief, she stretched herself at the foot of the mound,\nbeating the ground with her head. At this moment Kai-Koumou approached her. Suddenly the unfortunate\nvictim rose; but a violent blow with the \"méré,\" a formidable club,\nwielded by the hand of the chief, struck her lifeless to the earth. [Sidenote: POOR HUMANITY!] Frightful cries at once broke forth. A hundred arms threatened the\ncaptives, who trembled at the horrible sight. But no one stirred, for\nthe funeral ceremonies were not ended. Kara-Tété's wife had joined her husband in the other world. Both bodies\nlay side by side. But for the eternal life his faithful spouse could\nnot alone suffice the deceased. Who would serve them in presence of\nNouï-Atoua, if their slaves did not follow them? Six unfortunates were brought before the corpse of their master and\nmistress. They were servants, whom the pitiless laws of war had reduced\nto slavery. During the life of the chief they had undergone the\nseverest privations, suffered a thousand abuses, had been scantily fed,\nand compelled constantly to labor like beasts; and now, according to\nthe Maori belief, they were to continue their existence of servitude\nfor eternity. They appeared to be resigned to their fate, and were not astonished\nat a sacrifice they had long anticipated. Their freedom from all\nbonds showed that they would meet death unresistingly. Moreover, this\ndeath was rapid, protracted sufferings were spared them. These were\nreserved for the captives who stood trembling not twenty paces distant. Six blows of the méré, given by six stalwart warriors, stretched the\nvictims on the ground in a pool of blood. It was the signal for a\nterrible scene of cannibalism, which followed in all its horrible\ndetails. Glenarvan and his companions, breathless with fright, strove to hide\nthis awful scene from the eyes of the two unhappy ladies. They now\nunderstood what awaited them at sunrise the next day, and what cruel\ntortures would doubtless precede such a death. They were dumb with\nhorror. The funeral dance now began. Strong spirits, extracted from an\nindigenous plant, maddened the savages till they seemed no longer\nhuman.", "similarity": 0.33063650131225586}, {"chunk_id": 54, "text": "His brown color indicated a sound,\nspirited and courageous beast. He had a small and elegantly poised\nhead, widely opening nostrils, a fiery eye, large hams, swelling\nwithers, broad breast, long pasterns, in short, all the qualities that\nconstitute strength and suppleness. The major, like a perfect horseman,\nadmired unreservedly this specimen of the horses of the plains. This\nbeautiful creature was called Thaouka, which means \"bird\" in the\nPatagonian language, and he justly merited this appellation. [Sidenote: A FRESH START.] When Thalcave was in the saddle, the horse pranced with spirited grace,\nand the Patagonian, a skillful rider, was magnificent to behold. His\noutfit comprised two weapons of the chase, the \"bolas\" and the lasso. The bolas consists of three balls tied together by a leathern string,\nwhich are fastened to the front of the saddle. The Indians frequently\nthrow them the distance of a hundred paces at the animal or enemy that\nthey are pursuing, and with such precision that they twist about their\nlegs and bring them to the ground. It is, therefore, in their hands a\nformidable instrument, and they handle it with surprising dexterity. The lasso, on the contrary, does not leave the hand that wields it. It\nconsists simply of a leathern thong thirty feet in length, terminating\nin a slip-noose which works upon an iron ring. The right hand throws\nthe slip-noose, while the left hand holds the remainder of the lasso,\nthe end of which is firmly tied to the saddle. A long carbine in a\nsling completed the Patagonian's armament. Thalcave, without observing the admiration caused by his natural\ngrace, ease and courage, took the lead, and the party advanced, now\nat a gallop, and now at a walk, for their horses seemed entirely\nunaccustomed to trotting. Robert mounted with much boldness, and\nspeedily convinced Glenarvan of his ability to keep his seat. On issuing from the gorges of the Andes, they encountered a great\nnumber of sand-ridges, called \"medanos,\" real waves incessantly\nagitated by the wind, when the roots of the herbage did not confine\nthem to the earth. This sand is of an extreme fineness; and, at the\nleast breath, they saw it float away in light clouds, or form regular\nsand-columns which rose to a considerable height. This spectacle caused\npleasure as well as annoyance to the eyes. Pleasure, for nothing was\nmore curious than these columns, wandering over the plain, struggling,\nmingling, sinking and rising in inexpressible confusion; and annoyance,\nsince an impalpable dust emanated from these innumerable medanos and\npenetrated the eyelids, however tightly they were closed. [Illustration]\n\nThis phenomenon continued during a great part of the day. Nevertheless,\nthey advanced rapidly, and towards six o'clock the Andes, forty miles\ndistant, presented a darkish aspect already fading in the mists of the\nevening. The travelers were a little fatigued with their journey, and,\ntherefore, saw with pleasure the approach of the hour for retiring. They encamped on the shores of a turbulent stream, enclosed by lofty\nred cliffs. Toward noon of the next day, the sun's rays became very\noppressive, and at evening a line of clouds on the horizon indicated\na change in the weather. The Patagonian could not be deceived, and\npointed out to the geographer the western portion of the sky. \"Good, I know,\" said Paganel, and addressing his companions: \"A change\nin the weather is about to take place.

The three\nhorses galloped briskly forward. These excellent beasts perceived,\ndoubtless, by instinct, whither their masters were guiding them. Thaouka, especially, showed a spirit that neither fatigue nor thirst\ncould overcome. The other horses followed, at a slower pace, but\nincited by his example. The Patagonian frequently turned his head to look at Robert Grant, and,\nseeing the young boy firm and erect, in an easy and graceful position,\ntestified his satisfaction by a word of encouragement. \"Bravo, Robert!\" said Glenarvan. \"Thalcave seems to congratulate you. He praises you, my boy!\" \"And why, my lord?\" \"Because of the way you ride.\" \"Oh, I merely keep firm; that is all,\" replied Robert, who blushed with\npleasure at hearing himself complimented. \"That is the main point, Robert,\" said Glenarvan; \"but you are too\nmodest, and I am sure you cannot fail to become an accomplished\nequestrian.\" \"Well,\" said Robert, \"but what will papa say, who wishes to make a\nsailor of me?\" \"The one does not interfere with the other. If all horsemen do not make\ngood sailors, all sailors may certainly make good horsemen. To ride on\nthe yards, you must learn to keep yourself firm.

He thought only of us,\nand every voyage brought us a memento of the countries he visited, and,\nwhat was better, tender caresses and kind words, on his return. Ah! you will love him too, when you know him! Mary resembles him. He has a\nsweet voice like her. It is singular for a sailor, is it not?\" \"Yes, very singular, Robert,\" said Glenarvan. \"I see him still,\" replied the boy, as if speaking to himself. \"Good\nand brave papa!

During this conversation, their horses had relaxed their pace and\nfallen behind the other; but Thalcave called them, and they resumed\ntheir former gait. It was soon evident, however, that, with the\nexception of Thaouka, the horses could not long maintain this speed. At\nnoon it was necessary to give them an hour's rest. Glenarvan grew uneasy. The signs of dryness did not diminish, and the\nwant of water might result in disastrous consequences. Thalcave said\nnothing, but probably thought that if the Guamini was dry it would then\nbe time to despair, if indeed an Indian's heart has ever experienced\nsuch an emotion. They therefore kept on, and by use of whip and spur the horses were\ninduced to continue their journey, but they could not quicken their\npace.

[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII. A SERIOUS NECESSITY. They set out at daybreak. The horses advanced at a brisk pace among\nthe tufts of \"paja-brava,\" a kind of grass that serves the Indians\nas a shelter during the storms. At certain distances, but less and\nless frequent, pools of shallow water contributed to the growth of\nwillows and a certain plant which is found in the neighborhood of\nfresh water. Here the horses drank their fill, to fortify themselves\nfor the journey. Thalcave, who rode in advance, beat the bushes, and\nthus frightened away the \"cholinas\" (vipers), while the agile Thaouka\nbounded over all obstacles, and aided his master in clearing a passage\nfor the horses that followed. [Illustration: They set out at daybreak. The horses advanced at a brisk\npace among the tufts of \"paja-brava,\" a kind of grass that serves the\nIndians as a shelter during the storms.] Early in the afternoon, the first traces of animals were\nencountered--the bones of an innumerable drove of cattle, in whitened\nheaps. These fragments did not extend in a winding line, such as\nanimals exhausted and falling one by one would leave behind them. Thus\nno one, not even Paganel, knew how to explain this chain of skeletons\nin a space comparatively circumscribed. He therefore questioned\nThalcave, who was not at a loss for a reply. \"What is this?\" they asked, after Paganel had inquired of the Indian. \"The fire of heaven,\" replied the geographer. \"What! the lightning could not have produced such a disaster,\" said Tom\nAustin, \"and stretched five hundred head of cattle on the earth!\" But Thalcave reaffirmed it, and he was not mistaken; for the storms of\nthe Pampas are noted for their violence. At evening they stopped at an abandoned rancho, made of interlaced\nbranches plastered with mud and covered with thatch. This structure\nstood within an inclosure of half-rotten stakes which, however,\nsufficed to protect the horses during the night against the attacks of\nthe foxes. Not that they had anything to fear personally from these\nanimals, but the malicious beasts gnawed the halters, so that the\nhorses could escape. A few paces from the rancho, a hole was dug which served as a kitchen\nand contained half-cooled embers. Within, there was a bench, a bed of\nox-hide, a saucepan, a spit, and a pot for boiling maté. The maté is\na drink very much in use in South America. It is the Indian's tea,\nconsisting of a decoction of leaves dried in the fire, and is imbibed\nthrough a straw. At Paganel's request, Thalcave prepared several\ncups of this beverage, which very agreeably accompanied the ordinary\neatables, and was declared excellent. [Sidenote: A CHANGE FOR THE WORSE.] The next day they resumed their journey towards the east.

They approached within a\nhundred paces, so that they could be easily distinguished. Their high\nforeheads, prominent rather than receding, their tall forms, and their\nolive color, showed them to be magnificent types of the Indian race. They were clad in the skins of guanacos, and carried various weapons of\nwar and the chase, while their dexterity in horsemanship was remarkable. [Illustration]\n\nHaving halted, they appeared to hold a conference, crying and\ngesticulating. Glenarvan advanced toward them; but he had not proceeded\ntwo yards, when the detachment wheeled about and disappeared with\nincredible swiftness. The tired horses of the travelers could never\nhave overtaken them. \"The cowards!\" cried Paganel. \"They fly too fast for honest men,\" said MacNabb. \"What are these Indians?\" inquired Paganel of Thalcave. \"Gauchos!\" replied the Patagonian. \"Gauchos!\" repeated Paganel, turning toward his companions, \"Gauchos! We had no need, then, to take such precautions. There was nothing to\nfear!\" \"Why?\" asked the major. \"Because the Gauchos are inoffensive peasants.\" \"Do you think so, Paganel?\" \"Certainly.

But here a serious\ndisappointment awaited them,--the lake was dry! CHAPTER XVIII. IN SEARCH OF WATER. Lake Salinas terminates the cluster of lagoons that adjoin the Ventana\nand Guamini mountains. Numerous expeditions are made to this place\nto obtain supplies of salt, with which these waters are strongly\nimpregnated. But now the water had evaporated under the heat of the\nsun, and the lake was only a vast glittering basin. When Thalcave announced the presence of a drinkable liquid at Lake\nSalinas, he meant the streams of fresh water that flow from it in\nmany places. But at this time its affluents were as dry as itself. The burning sun had absorbed everything. Hence, the consternation was\ngeneral when the thirsty party arrived at the parched shores of Lake\nSalinas. It was necessary to take counsel. The little water in the leathern\nbottles was half spoiled, and could not quench their thirst, which\nbegan to make itself acutely felt. Hunger and fatigue gave place to\nthis imperative want. A \"roukah,\" a kind of upright tent, of leather,\nwhich stood in a hollow, and had been abandoned by the natives, served\nas a refuge for the travelers, while their horses, stretched on the\nmuddy shores of the lake, ate the saline plants and dry reeds, although\nreluctantly. When each had sat down in the roukah, Paganel asked Thalcave's advice\nas to what was best to be done. A rapid conversation, of which\nGlenarvan caught a few words, ensued between the geographer and the\nIndian. Thalcave spoke calmly, while Paganel gesticulated for both.", "similarity": 0.5064558982849121}, {"chunk_id": 65, "text": "A great quantity of dry fodder, piled in\nthe ramada, served them for food and bedding.

The waters of the Guamini flowed without a murmur,\nwhile birds, quadrupeds, and reptiles reposed after the fatigues of\nthe day. The silence of the desert reigned on the vast expanse of the\nPampas. Glenarvan, Robert, and Thalcave had yielded to the common law, and,\nstretched on their thick beds of grass, they enjoyed a refreshing\nsleep. The horses, overcome with fatigue, had lain down on the ground:\nThaouka alone, like a true blooded horse, slept standing, spirited in\nrepose as in action, and ready to start at the least sign from his\nmaster. Perfect tranquillity reigned within the inclosure, and the\nembers of the night-fire, as they gradually died out, cast their last\nrays over the silent obscurity. About ten o'clock, after a short sleep, the Indian awoke. His eyes\nbecame fixed beneath his lowered eyebrows, and his head was turned in a\nlistening attitude towards the plain. He seemed endeavoring to detect\nsome scarcely perceptible sound. A vague uneasiness was soon expressed\non his face, usually so calm. Had he perceived the approach of prowling\nIndians, or the coming of jaguars, water-tigers, and other formidable\nbeasts which are numerous in the neighborhood of rivers? This last\npossibility doubtless appeared plausible to him, for he cast a rapid\nglance over the combustible materials piled in the inclosure, and his\nanxiety increased. In fact, all this dry bedding would quickly be\nconsumed, and could not long intimidate the audacious animals.

An hour passed. Any other person but Thalcave, reassured by the outward\nsilence, would have lain down again. But where a stranger would have\nsuspected nothing, the highly-trained senses and natural instinct of\nthe Indian foresaw the coming danger. While he was listening and watching, Thaouka gave a low neigh. His\nnose was stretched towards the entrance to the ramada. The Patagonian\nsuddenly started. \"Thaouka has scented some enemy,\" said he. He arose and scanned the plain attentively. Silence still reigned, but\nnot tranquillity. Thalcave discerned shadows moving noiselessly among\nthe tufts of grass. Here and there glittered luminous points, which\nspread on all sides, now fading away, and now gleaming forth again. You\nwould have thought fantastic elves were dancing on the surface of an\nimmense lagoon. A stranger would doubtless have taken these flitting\nsparks for glow-worms, which shine, when night comes, in many parts of\nthe Pampas. But Thalcave was not deceived; he knew with what enemies he\nhad to deal. He loaded his carbine, and took a position near the first\nstakes of the inclosure. He did not wait long. A strange cry, a mingling of barks and howls,\nresounded over the plain.

He doubtless thought\nof it, but probably did not like to leave his two companions alone in\nthe midst of this desert, and, that he might not outstrip them, he\nforced Thaouka to lessen his speed. It was not, however, without much\nresistance, prancing and neighing, that Thalcave's horse consented to\nkeep pace with the others. It was not so much the strength as the voice\nof his master which restrained him; the Indian actually talked to his\nhorse; and the animal, if he did not answer, at least comprehended\nhim. The Patagonian must have used excellent arguments, for, after\n\"discussing\" some time, Thaouka yielded, and obeyed his master's\ncommands. [Sidenote: GAINED AT LAST.] But, if Thaouka understood Thalcave, Thalcave had none the less\nunderstood Thaouka. The intelligent animal, through his superior\ninstincts, had perceived a moisture in the air. He inhaled it eagerly,\nand kept moving his tongue, as if it were steeped in a grateful liquid. The Patagonian could not be deceived; water was not far distant. He therefore encouraged his companions by explaining the impatience of\nhis horse, which the others were not long in understanding. They made a\nfinal effort, and galloped after the Indian. About three o'clock a bright line appeared in a hollow of the plain. It\ntrembled under the rays of the sun. \"Water!\" cried Glenarvan. \"Water, yes, water!\" cried Robert. They had no more need to urge their horses. The poor beasts, feeling\ntheir strength renewed, rushed forward with an irresistible eagerness. In a few moments they had reached the Guamini River, and, saddled as\nthey were, plunged to their breasts into the cooling stream. Their\nmasters imitated their example, without reluctance, and took an\nafternoon bath which was as healthful as it was pleasant. [Illustration]\n\n\"Ah, how good it is!\" said Robert, as he quenched his thirst in the\nmiddle of the river. \"Be moderate, my boy,\" said Glenarvan, who did not set a good example. Nothing was heard but the sound of rapid drinking. As for Thalcave,\nhe drank quietly, without hurrying, long and deeply, till they might\nperhaps fear that the stream would be drained. \"Well,\" said Glenarvan, \"our friends will not be disappointed in their\nexpectations. They are sure, on arriving at the Guamini, to find an\nabundance of clear water, if Thalcave leaves any!\" \"But could we not go to meet them?\" asked Robert. \"We could spare them\nseveral hours of anxiety.\" \"Doubtless, my boy; but how carry the water? Wilson has charge of the\nwater-bottles. No, it is better to wait, as we agreed. Calculating the\nnecessary time, and the slow pace of the horses, our friends will be\nhere at night. Let us, then, prepare them a safe shelter and a good\nrepast.\" Thalcave had not waited for Glenarvan's orders to search for a place\nto encamp. He had very fortunately found on the banks of the river a\n\"ramada,\" a kind of inclosure designed for a cattle-fold and shut in\non three sides. The situation was excellent for the purpose, so long\nas one did not fear to sleep in the open air; and that was the least\nanxiety of Thalcave's companions. Thus they did not seek a better\nretreat, but stretched themselves on the ground in the sun to dry their\nwater-soaked garments. \"Well, since here is shelter,\" said Glenarvan, \"let us think of supper.", "similarity": 0.511256754398346}]}

The three\nhorses galloped briskly forward. These excellent beasts perceived,\ndoubtless, by instinct, whither their masters were guiding them. Thaouka, especially, showed a spirit that neither fatigue nor thirst\ncould overcome. The other horses followed, at a slower pace, but\nincited by his example. The Patagonian frequently turned his head to look at Robert Grant, and,\nseeing the young boy firm and erect, in an easy and graceful position,\ntestified his satisfaction by a word of encouragement. \"Bravo, Robert!\" said Glenarvan. \"Thalcave seems to congratulate you.

He thought only of us,\nand every voyage brought us a memento of the countries he visited, and,\nwhat was better, tender caresses and kind words, on his return. Ah! you will love him too, when you know him! Mary resembles him. He has a\nsweet voice like her. It is singular for a sailor, is it not?\" \"Yes, very singular, Robert,\" said Glenarvan. \"I see him still,\" replied the boy, as if speaking to himself. \"Good\nand brave papa!

During this conversation, their horses had relaxed their pace and\nfallen behind the other; but Thalcave called them, and they resumed\ntheir former gait. It was soon evident, however, that, with the\nexception of Thaouka, the horses could not long maintain this speed. At\nnoon it was necessary to give them an hour's rest. Glenarvan grew uneasy. The signs of dryness did not diminish, and the\nwant of water might result in disastrous consequences. Thalcave said\nnothing, but probably thought that if the Guamini was dry it would then\nbe time to despair, if indeed an Indian's heart has ever experienced\nsuch an emotion.

Ah,\nit is beginning!\" [Sidenote: AN EXTRAORDINARY STORM.] Violent thunder-claps interrupted this conversation, and their\nintensity increased till they reached the most deafening peals. They soon became sonorous, and made the atmosphere vibrate in rapid\noscillations. The firmament was on fire, and during this commotion\nit was impossible to distinguish from what electric spark emanated\nthe indefinitely-prolonged rumblings that reverberated throughout the\nabysses of the sky. The incessant flashes assumed various forms. Some, darting\nperpendicularly towards the earth, were repeated five or six times in\nthe same place; others, separating into a thousand different branches,\nspread in zigzag lines and produced on the dark vault of the heavens\nastonishing jets of arborescent flame. Soon the sky, from east to\nnorth, was crossed by a phosphorescent band of intense brilliancy. This\nillumination gradually overspread the entire horizon, lighting up the\nclouds like a bonfire, and was reflected in the mirror-like waters,\nforming what seemed to be an immense circle of fire, of which the tree\noccupied the centre. Glenarvan and his companions watched this terrific spectacle in\nsilence. Sheets of dazzling light glided towards them, and blinding\nflashes followed in rapid succession, now showing the calm countenance\nof the major, then the speculative face of Paganel or the energetic\nfeatures of Glenarvan, and again the frightened look of Robert or the\nunconcerned expression of the sailors. The rain, however, did not fall\nas yet, nor had the wind risen. But soon the flood-gates of the heavens\nopened, and the rain came down in torrents, the drops, as they struck\nthe surface of the water, rebounding in thousands of sparks illuminated\nby the incessant lightning. Did this rain predict the end of the storm? Were Glenarvan and his\ncompanions to be released with a few thorough drenchings?

Paganel was right. His horse had been suddenly stricken dead. \"This is singular,\" said the captain. \"Very singular indeed,\" muttered the major. Glenarvan could not restrain a feeling of uneasiness at this strange\noccurrence. It was impossible for them to retrace their steps in this\ndesert; while, if an epidemic were to seize all the horses, it would be\nvery difficult to continue the journey. Before the end of the day his fears seemed to be justified. A third\nhorse, Wilson's, fell dead, and, what was worse, one of the oxen was\nalso stricken. Their means of conveyance now consisted of only three\noxen and four horses. [Sidenote: A FINE FERNERY.] The situation had grown serious. The mounted horsemen could, of course,\ntake turns in traveling on foot. But, if it should be necessary to\nleave the cart behind, what would become of the ladies? Could they\naccomplish the one hundred and twenty miles that still separated them\nfrom Twofold Bay? Captain Mangles and Glenarvan anxiously examined the remaining horses:\nperhaps preventives might be found against new calamities. No sign\nof disease, however, could be detected. The animals were in perfect\nhealth, and bravely endured the hardships of the journey. Glenarvan,\ntherefore, was inclined to think that this mysterious epidemic would\nhave no more victims. This was Ayrton's opinion too, who declared that\nhe could not at all understand the cause of the frightful mortality. They started again, and the cart served to convey the pedestrians, who\nrode in it by turns. At evening, after a journey of only ten miles, the\nsignal to halt was given, the encampment arranged, and the night was\npassed comfortably beneath a large group of arborescent ferns, among\nwhose branches fluttered enormous bats. The next day they made an excellent beginning, and accomplished fifteen\nmiles. Everything led them to hope that they would encamp that evening\non the banks of the Snowy River. Evening came, and a fog, clearly\ndefined against the horizon, marked the course of the long-looked-for\nstream. A forest of tall trees was seen at a bend in the road, behind\na moderate elevation. Ayrton guided his oxen towards the tall trunks\ndimly discerned in the shadow, and was just passing the boundary of the\nwood, when the cart sank into the earth to the hubs. \"What is the matter?\" asked Glenarvan, when he perceived that the cart\nhad come to a stop. \"We are fast in the mud,\" replied Ayrton. He urged his oxen with voice and whip, but they were up to their knees\nin the mire, and could not stir. \"Let us encamp here,\" said Captain Mangles. \"That is the best plan,\" answered Ayrton. \"To-morrow, at daybreak, we\ncan see to extricate ourselves.\" [Illustration: Early in the afternoon they passed through a curious\nforest of ferns.

From an examination\nof the ground and the absence of fresh tracks, the Patagonian knew that\nit had not been occupied for a long time. The next morning Glenarvan and his companions found themselves again\non the plain. The first estancias (vast establishments for raising\ncattle), which border upon the Tandil, were descried; but Thalcave\nresolved not to stop, but to keep straight on to Fort Independence,\nwhere he wished to obtain information, especially concerning the\nsingular condition of this abandoned country. The trees, so rare since leaving the Andes, now reappeared. The greater\npart of these have been planted since the arrival of the Europeans\non the American continent. They generally surround \"corrals,\" vast\ncattle-inclosures protected with stakes. Here thousands of cattle,\nsheep, cows, and horses, branded with the mark of the owner, graze\nand fatten, while large numbers of huge dogs keep watch. The soil is\nadmirably adapted to raising cattle, and yields an excellent fodder. The people lead the life of the shepherds of the Bible. Their flocks\nare perhaps even more numerous than those which fed on the plains of\nMesopotamia; but the family element is wanting, and the owners of the\ngreat folds of the Pampas have little to recommend themselves or their\nmanner of life. Paganel explained all these particulars to his companions, and even\nsucceeded in interesting the major. Thalcave, meanwhile, hastened their progress, as he wished to arrive\nthat evening at Fort Independence. The horses, urged on by their\nmasters, and following the example of Thaouka, dashed through the\ntall grass. They passed several farms, fortified and defended by deep\nditches. The principal house was provided with an elevated terrace,\nfrom which the inmates could fire upon the plunderers of the plain. Glenarvan might perhaps have obtained here the information that he\nsought; but it was wisest to go to the village of Tandil. They did not\nstop, therefore, and soon the feet of the horses struck the grassy\nsward of the first mountain slopes.

They were thus perpetually\nemployed,—Faria, that he might not see himself grow old; Dantès, for\nfear of recalling the almost extinct past which now only floated in his\nmemory like a distant light wandering in the night. So life went on for\nthem as it does for those who are not victims of misfortune and whose\nactivities glide along mechanically and tranquilly beneath the eye of\nProvidence. But beneath this superficial calm there were in the heart of the young\nman, and perhaps in that of the old man, many repressed desires, many\nstifled sighs, which found vent when Faria was left alone, and when\nEdmond returned to his cell. One night Edmond awoke suddenly, believing that he heard someone\ncalling him. He opened his eyes upon utter darkness. His name, or\nrather a plaintive voice which essayed to pronounce his name, reached\nhim. He sat up in bed and a cold sweat broke out upon his brow. Undoubtedly the call came from Faria’s dungeon. “Alas,” murmured Edmond; “can it be?”\n\nHe moved his bed, drew up the stone, rushed into the passage, and\nreached the opposite extremity; the secret entrance was open. By the\nlight of the wretched and wavering lamp, of which we have spoken,\nDantès saw the old man, pale, but yet erect, clinging to the bedstead. His features were writhing with those horrible symptoms which he\nalready knew, and which had so seriously alarmed him when he saw them\nfor the first time. “Alas, my dear friend,” said Faria in a resigned tone, “you understand,\ndo you not, and I need not attempt to explain to you?”\n\nEdmond uttered a cry of agony, and, quite out of his senses, rushed\ntowards the door, exclaiming, “Help, help!”\n\nFaria had just sufficient strength to restrain him. “Silence,” he said, “or you are lost. We must now only think of you, my\ndear friend, and so act as to render your captivity supportable or your\nflight possible. It would require years to do again what I have done\nhere, and the results would be instantly destroyed if our jailers knew\nwe had communicated with each other.

At length Providence\nhas done something for you; he restores to you more than he takes away,\nand it was time I should die.”\n\nEdmond could only clasp his hands and exclaim, “Oh, my friend, my\nfriend, speak not thus!” and then resuming all his presence of mind,\nwhich had for a moment staggered under this blow, and his strength,\nwhich had failed at the words of the old man, he said, “Oh, I have\nsaved you once, and I will save you a second time!” And raising the\nfoot of the bed, he drew out the phial, still a third filled with the\nred liquor. “See,” he exclaimed, “there remains still some of the magic draught.

In the centre of the cell, in a circle traced with a fragment of\nplaster detached from the wall, sat a man whose tattered garments\nscarcely covered him. He was drawing in this circle geometrical lines,\nand seemed as much absorbed in his problem as Archimedes was when the\nsoldier of Marcellus slew him.

The inspector begged the Englishman to seat himself\nin an armchair, and placed before him the register and documents\nrelative to the Château d’If, giving him all the time he desired for\nthe examination, while De Boville seated himself in a corner, and began\nto read his newspaper. The Englishman easily found the entries relative\nto the Abbé Faria; but it seemed that the history which the inspector\nhad related interested him greatly, for after having perused the first\ndocuments he turned over the leaves until he reached the deposition\nrespecting Edmond Dantès. There he found everything arranged in due\norder,—the accusation, examination, Morrel’s petition, M. de\nVillefort’s marginal notes. He folded up the accusation quietly, and\nput it as quietly in his pocket; read the examination, and saw that the\nname of Noirtier was not mentioned in it; perused, too, the application\ndated 10th April, 1815, in which Morrel, by the deputy procureur’s\nadvice, exaggerated with the best intentions (for Napoleon was then on\nthe throne) the services Dantès had rendered to the imperial\ncause—services which Villefort’s certificates rendered indisputable. Then he saw through the whole thing. This petition to Napoleon, kept\nback by Villefort, had become, under the second restoration, a terrible\nweapon against him in the hands of the king’s attorney. He was no\nlonger astonished when he searched on to find in the register this\nnote, placed in a bracket against his name:\n\nEdmond Dantès. An inveterate Bonapartist; took an active part in the return from the\nIsland of Elba. To be kept in strict solitary confinement, and to be closely watched\nand guarded. Beneath these lines was written in another hand: “See note\nabove—nothing can be done.”\n\nHe compared the writing in the bracket with the writing of the\ncertificate placed beneath Morrel’s petition, and discovered that the\nnote in the bracket was the same writing as the certificate—that is to\nsay, was in Villefort’s handwriting. 20029m\n\n\n\nAs to the note which accompanied this, the Englishman understood that\nit might have been added by some inspector who had taken a momentary\ninterest in Dantès’ situation, but who had, from the remarks we have\nquoted, found it impossible to give any effect to the interest he had\nfelt. As we have said, the inspector, from discretion, and that he might not\ndisturb the Abbé Faria’s pupil in his researches, had seated himself in\na corner, and was reading _Le Drapeau Blanc_. He did not see the\nEnglishman fold up and place in his pocket the accusation written by\nDanglars under the arbor of La Réserve, and which had the postmark,\n“Marseilles, 27th February, delivery 6 o’clock, P.M.”\n\nBut it must be said that if he had seen it, he attached so little\nimportance to this scrap of paper, and so much importance to his two\nhundred thousand francs, that he would not have opposed whatever the\nEnglishman might do, however irregular it might be. “Thanks,” said the latter, closing the register with a slam, “I have\nall I want; now it is for me to perform my promise.", "similarity": 0.4904179275035858}, {"chunk_id": 684, "text": "‘I am Haydée, the daughter of Ali Tepelini, pasha of Yanina, and of\nVasiliki, his beloved wife.’\n\n40202m\n\n\n\n“The blush of mingled pride and modesty which suddenly suffused the\ncheeks of the young woman, the brilliancy of her eye, and her highly\nimportant communication, produced an indescribable effect on the\nassembly. As for the count, he could not have been more overwhelmed if\na thunderbolt had fallen at his feet and opened an immense gulf before\nhim. “‘Madame,’ replied the president, bowing with profound respect, ‘allow\nme to ask one question; it shall be the last: Can you prove the\nauthenticity of what you have now stated?’\n\n“‘I can, sir,’ said Haydée, drawing from under her veil a satin satchel\nhighly perfumed; ‘for here is the register of my birth, signed by my\nfather and his principal officers, and that of my baptism, my father\nhaving consented to my being brought up in my mother’s faith,—this\nlatter has been sealed by the grand primate of Macedonia and Epirus;\nand lastly (and perhaps the most important), the record of the sale of\nmy person and that of my mother to the Armenian merchant El-Kobbir, by\nthe French officer, who, in his infamous bargain with the Porte, had\nreserved as his part of the booty the wife and daughter of his\nbenefactor, whom he sold for the sum of four hundred thousand francs.’\nA greenish pallor spread over the count’s cheeks, and his eyes became\nbloodshot at these terrible imputations, which were listened to by the\nassembly with ominous silence. “Haydée, still calm, but with a calmness more dreadful than the anger\nof another would have been, handed to the president the record of her\nsale, written in Arabic. It had been supposed some of the papers might\nbe in the Arabian, Romaic, or Turkish language, and the interpreter of\nthe House was in attendance.

It was the governor, who, hearing of Faria’s illness from the jailer,\nhad come in person to see him. Faria sat up to receive him, avoiding all gestures in order that he\nmight conceal from the governor the paralysis that had already half\nstricken him with death. His fear was lest the governor, touched with\npity, might order him to be removed to better quarters, and thus\nseparate him from his young companion. But fortunately this was not the\ncase, and the governor left him, convinced that the poor madman, for\nwhom in his heart he felt a kind of affection, was only troubled with a\nslight indisposition. During this time, Edmond, seated on his bed with his head in his hands,\ntried to collect his scattered thoughts. Faria, since their first\nacquaintance, had been on all points so rational and logical, so\nwonderfully sagacious, in fact, that he could not understand how so\nmuch wisdom on all points could be allied with madness. Was Faria\ndeceived as to his treasure, or was all the world deceived as to Faria? Dantès remained in his cell all day, not daring to return to his\nfriend, thinking thus to defer the moment when he should be convinced,\nonce for all, that the abbé was mad—such a conviction would be so\nterrible! But, towards the evening after the hour for the customary visit had\ngone by, Faria, not seeing the young man appear, tried to move and get\nover the distance which separated them. Edmond shuddered when he heard\nthe painful efforts which the old man made to drag himself along; his\nleg was inert, and he could no longer make use of one arm. Edmond was\nobliged to assist him, for otherwise he would not have been able to\nenter by the small aperture which led to Dantès’ chamber. “Here I am, pursuing you remorselessly,” he said with a benignant\nsmile. “You thought to escape my munificence, but it is in vain.

He remained in his cell, and\nthis visit only increased the belief in his insanity. Caligula or Nero, those treasure-seekers, those desirers of the\nimpossible, would have accorded to the poor wretch, in exchange for his\nwealth, the liberty he so earnestly prayed for. But the kings of modern\ntimes, restrained by the limits of mere probability, have neither\ncourage nor desire. They fear the ear that hears their orders, and the\neye that scrutinizes their actions. Formerly they believed themselves\nsprung from Jupiter, and shielded by their birth; but nowadays they are\nnot inviolable. It has always been against the policy of despotic governments to suffer\nthe victims of their persecutions to reappear. As the Inquisition\nrarely allowed its victims to be seen with their limbs distorted and\ntheir flesh lacerated by torture, so madness is always concealed in its\ncell, from whence, should it depart, it is conveyed to some gloomy\nhospital, where the doctor has no thought for man or mind in the\nmutilated being the jailer delivers to him. The very madness of the\nAbbé Faria, gone mad in prison, condemned him to perpetual captivity. The inspector kept his word with Dantès; he examined the register, and\nfound the following note concerning him:\n\n_Edmond Dantès:_\n\nViolent Bonapartist; took an active part in the return from Elba. The greatest watchfulness and care to be exercised. This note was in a different hand from the rest, which showed that it\nhad been added since his confinement. The inspector could not contend\nagainst this accusation; he simply wrote, _Nothing to be done._\n\nThis visit had infused new vigor into Dantès; he had, till then,\nforgotten the date; but now, with a fragment of plaster, he wrote the\ndate, 30th July, 1816, and made a mark every day, in order not to lose\nhis reckoning again. Days and weeks passed away, then months—Dantès\nstill waited; he at first expected to be freed in a fortnight. This\nfortnight expired, he decided that the inspector would do nothing until\nhis return to Paris, and that he would not reach there until his\ncircuit was finished, he therefore fixed three months; three months\npassed away, then six more. Finally ten months and a half had gone by\nand no favorable change had taken place, and Dantès began to fancy the\ninspector’s visit but a dream, an illusion of the brain. At the expiration of a year the governor was transferred; he had\nobtained charge of the fortress at Ham. He took with him several of his\nsubordinates, and amongst them Dantès’ jailer.

His protruding and deeply furrowed\nbrow, his fierce look and his sinister countenance, showed him to be a\nformidable individual. He was a Maori chief of high rank, as could be seen by the delicate\nand compact tattooing that striped his face and body. Two black\nspirals, starting from the nostrils of his aquiline nose, circled his\ntawny eyes, met on his forehead, and were lost in his abundant hair. His mouth, with its shining teeth, and his chin, were hidden beneath\na net-work of varied colors, while graceful lines wound down to his\nsinewy breast. There was no doubt as to his rank. The sharp albatross bone, used\nby Maori tattooers, had furrowed his face five times, in close and\ndeep lines. That he had reached his fifth promotion was evident from\nhis haughty bearing. A large flaxen mat, ornamented with dog-skins,\nenveloped his person; while a girdle, bloody with his recent conflicts,\nencircled his waist. From his ears dangled ear-rings of green jade, and\naround his neck hung necklaces of \"pounamous,\" sacred stones to which\nthe New Zealanders attribute miraculous properties. At his side lay a\ngun of English manufacture, and a \"patou-patou,\" a kind of double-edged\nhatchet. Near him nine warriors, of lower rank, armed and of ferocious aspect,\nsome still suffering from recent wounds, stood in perfect immobility,\nenveloped in their flaxen mantles. Three dogs of wild appearance were\nstretched at their feet. The eight rowers seemed to be servants or\nslaves of the chief. They worked vigorously, and the boat ascended the\ncurrent of the Waikato with remarkable swiftness. In the centre of this long canoe, with feet tied, but hands free, were\nten European prisoners clinging closely to each other. They were Lord\nGlenarvan and his companions.

About midnight,\nthe travelers, surprised in their sleep, were made prisoners and\ncarried on board the canoe. They had not yet been maltreated, but had\ntried in vain to resist. Their arms and ammunition were in the hands of\nthe savages, and their own bullets would have quickly stretched them on\nthe earth had they attempted to escape. They were not long in learning, by the aid of a few English words which\nthe natives used, that, being driven back by the British troops, they\nwere returning, vanquished and weakened, to the regions of the upper\nWaikato. Their chief, after an obstinate resistance, in which he lost\nhis principal warriors, was now on his way to rouse again the river\ntribes. He was called Kai-Koumou, a terrible name, which signified\nin the native language \"he who eats the limbs of his enemy.\" He was\nbrave and bold, but his cruelty equaled his bravery. No pity could be\nexpected from him. His name was well known to the English soldiers, and\na price had been set upon his head by the governor of New Zealand.

At the same time he hooked\nhimself, giving the line a violent shake, whereupon the sailors\nhoisted the huge creature by means of a pulley at the end of the\nyard-arm. The shark struggled violently at feeling himself drawn from his natural\nelement, but his struggles were of no avail. A rope with a slip-noose\nconfined his tail and paralyzed his movements. A few moments afterward\nhe was hauled over the ratlings, and precipitated upon the deck of the\nyacht. One of the sailors at once approached him, not without caution,\nand with a vigorous blow of the hatchet cut off the formidable tail of\nthe animal. The chase was ended, and there was nothing more to fear from the\nmonster. The vengeance of the sailors was satisfied, but not their\ncuriosity. Indeed, it is customary on board of every vessel to\ncarefully examine the stomachs of sharks. The men, knowing the\ninordinate voracity of the creature, wait with some anxiety, and their\nexpectation is not always in vain. Lady Glenarvan, not wishing to witness this strange \"exploration,\"\nretired to the cabin. The shark was still panting. He was ten feet\nlong, and weighed more than six hundred pounds. These dimensions are\nnothing extraordinary; for if the balance-fish is not classed among the\ngiants of this species, at least he belongs to the most formidable of\ntheir family. The enormous fish was soon cut open by a blow of the hatchet, without\nfurther ceremony. The hook had penetrated to the stomach, which was\nabsolutely empty.

Moreover,\nthe unfortunate woman would not have been allowed to survive him;\nit was the custom, in accordance with duty, and examples of such\nsacrifices are not wanting in New Zealand history. The woman appeared. She was still young. Her hair floated in disorder over her shoulders. Vague words, lamentations, and broken phrases, in which she celebrated\nthe virtues of the dead, interrupted her groans; and, in a final\nparoxysm of grief, she stretched herself at the foot of the mound,\nbeating the ground with her head. At this moment Kai-Koumou approached her. Suddenly the unfortunate\nvictim rose; but a violent blow with the \"méré,\" a formidable club,\nwielded by the hand of the chief, struck her lifeless to the earth.

But for the eternal life his faithful spouse could\nnot alone suffice the deceased. Who would serve them in presence of\nNouï-Atoua, if their slaves did not follow them?

Moreover, this\ndeath was rapid, protracted sufferings were spared them. These were\nreserved for the captives who stood trembling not twenty paces distant. Six blows of the méré, given by six stalwart warriors, stretched the\nvictims on the ground in a pool of blood.

The major, like a perfect horseman,\nadmired unreservedly this specimen of the horses of the plains. This\nbeautiful creature was called Thaouka, which means \"bird\" in the\nPatagonian language, and he justly merited this appellation. [Sidenote: A FRESH START.] When Thalcave was in the saddle, the horse pranced with spirited grace,\nand the Patagonian, a skillful rider, was magnificent to behold. His\noutfit comprised two weapons of the chase, the \"bolas\" and the lasso. The bolas consists of three balls tied together by a leathern string,\nwhich are fastened to the front of the saddle. The Indians frequently\nthrow them the distance of a hundred paces at the animal or enemy that\nthey are pursuing, and with such precision that they twist about their\nlegs and bring them to the ground. It is, therefore, in their hands a\nformidable instrument, and they handle it with surprising dexterity. The lasso, on the contrary, does not leave the hand that wields it. It\nconsists simply of a leathern thong thirty feet in length, terminating\nin a slip-noose which works upon an iron ring. The right hand throws\nthe slip-noose, while the left hand holds the remainder of the lasso,\nthe end of which is firmly tied to the saddle. A long carbine in a\nsling completed the Patagonian's armament. Thalcave, without observing the admiration caused by his natural\ngrace, ease and courage, took the lead, and the party advanced, now\nat a gallop, and now at a walk, for their horses seemed entirely\nunaccustomed to trotting. Robert mounted with much boldness, and\nspeedily convinced Glenarvan of his ability to keep his seat. On issuing from the gorges of the Andes, they encountered a great\nnumber of sand-ridges, called \"medanos,\" real waves incessantly\nagitated by the wind, when the roots of the herbage did not confine\nthem to the earth. This sand is of an extreme fineness; and, at the\nleast breath, they saw it float away in light clouds, or form regular\nsand-columns which rose to a considerable height. This spectacle caused\npleasure as well as annoyance to the eyes. Pleasure, for nothing was\nmore curious than these columns, wandering over the plain, struggling,\nmingling, sinking and rising in inexpressible confusion; and annoyance,\nsince an impalpable dust emanated from these innumerable medanos and\npenetrated the eyelids, however tightly they were closed.

They encamped on the shores of a turbulent stream, enclosed by lofty\nred cliffs. Toward noon of the next day, the sun's rays became very\noppressive, and at evening a line of clouds on the horizon indicated\na change in the weather. The Patagonian could not be deceived, and\npointed out to the geographer the western portion of the sky. \"Good, I know,\" said Paganel, and addressing his companions: \"A change\nin the weather is about to take place.

Then his presentiments returned with more vividness, while\nhe listened vaguely to the external sounds so difficult to explain on\nthese solitary summits. At one moment he thought he heard distant rumblings, dull and\nthreatening like the rollings of thunder. These sounds could be caused\nonly by a tempest, raging on the sides of the mountain. He wished to\nconvince himself, and left the hut. The moon had risen, and the sky was clear and calm.

However, having no certain knowledge of immediate danger, he did not\nwake his companions, whom fatigue held in a deep repose, but fell\nhimself into a heavy sleep that lasted several hours.

The\nform of the mountains suddenly changed, their tops were truncated,\nthe tottering peaks disappeared, as if a pitfall had opened at their\nbase. A mass, several miles in extent, became detached entire, and slid\ntowards the plain. \"An earthquake!\" cried Paganel. He was not mistaken.

[Illustration: A boat might have been seen ascending the Waikato. It\nwas a canoe seventy feet long and five broad.] Since leaving the encampment, the natives, taciturn like all savages,\nhad scarcely spoken to each other. However, from a few words exchanged,\nGlenarvan perceived that they were acquainted with the English\nlanguage. He therefore resolved to question the chief in regard to the\nfate that was in store for them. Addressing Kai-Koumou, he said, in a\nfearless tone:\n\n\"Where are you taking us, chief?\" Kai-Koumou gazed at him coldly without answering. \"Say, what do you expect to do with us?\" continued Glenarvan. The chief's eyes blazed with a sudden light, and in a stern voice he\nreplied:\n\n\"To exchange you, if your friends will ransom you; to kill you, if they\nrefuse.\" Glenarvan asked no more, but hope returned to his heart. Doubtless,\nsome chiefs of the Maori tribe had fallen into the hands of the\nEnglish, and the natives would attempt to recover them by way of\nexchange; their situation, therefore, was not one for despair. Meantime the canoe rapidly ascended the river. Paganel, whose\nchangeable disposition carried him from one extreme to another, had\nregained his hopefulness.

The Waikato River is worshiped by the natives, as Paganel knew, and\nEnglish and German naturalists have never ascended beyond its junction\nwith the Waipa. Whither did Kai-Koumou intend to take his captives? The geographer could not have guessed if the word \"Taupo,\" frequently\nrepeated, had not attracted his attention. By consulting his map,\nhe saw that this name was applied to a celebrated lake in the most\nmountainous part of the island, and that from it the Waikato flows.

They therefore determined to avoid them at all\nhazards, and gain the eastern coast, where the missionaries have\nfounded several establishments. Moreover, this portion of the island\nhad hitherto escaped the ravages of the war and the depredations of the\nnatives. As for the distance that separated Lake Taupo from the Bay of\nPlenty, it could not be more than one hundred miles. Ten days would\nsuffice for the journey.

The two women were resigned to their fate, while\nthe men concealed their anguish beneath a calmness that showed\nsuperhuman self-control. They came before the chief, who did not delay\nsentence. \"You killed Kara-Tété!\" said he to Glenarvan. \"I did.\" [Sidenote: THE BEGINNING OF THE END.] \"You shall die to-morrow at sunrise.\" \"Alone?\" inquired Glenarvan, whose heart beat quickly. \"What! as if our Tohonga's life were not more precious than yours!\" cried Kai-Koumou, whose eyes expressed a fierce regret. At this moment a commotion took place among the natives. Glenarvan cast\na rapid glance around him. The crowd opened, and a warrior, dripping\nwith sweat and overcome with fatigue, appeared. As soon as Kai-Koumou perceived him, he said in English, evidently that\nhe might be understood by the captives:\n\n\"You come from the camp of the pale-faces?\" \"Yes,\" replied the Maori. \"You saw the prisoner, our Tohonga?\" \"I did.\" \"Is he living?\" \"He is dead! The English have shot him.\" The fate of Glenarvan and his companions was settled. \"You shall all die to-morrow at daybreak!\" cried Kai-Koumou. The unfortunates were therefore to suffer a common death. Lady Helena\nand Mary Grant raised towards heaven a look of thankfulness. The captives were not taken back to the temple. They were to attend\nthat day the funeral of the dead chief, and the bloody ceremonies\nconnected therewith. A party of natives conducted them to the foot of\nan enormous koudi, where these guardians remained without losing sight\nof their prisoners. The rest of the tribe, absorbed in their official\nmourning, seemed to have forgotten them. The customary three days had elapsed since the death of Kara-Tété. The\nsoul of the deceased had therefore forever abandoned its mortal abode. The sacred rites began. The body was carried to a small mound in the centre of the\nfortification, clothed in splendid costume, and enveloped in a\nmagnificent flaxen mat. The head was adorned with plumes, and wore a\ncrown of green leaves. The face, arms, and breast had been rubbed with\noil, and therefore showed no mortification. The parents and friends of the deceased came to the foot of the\nmound, and all at once, as if some director were beating time to a\nfuneral dirge, a great concert of cries, groans, and sobs arose on the\nair. They mourned the dead in plaintive and modulated cadences.", "similarity": 0.39271557331085205}, {"chunk_id": 110, "text": "Vain hope! At eight o'clock in the\nmorning it was still blowing hard, and the wind soon became a hurricane. The captain said nothing, but he trembled for his vessel and those\nwhom she carried. The Duncan now and then gave a fearful lurch; her\nstanchions cracked, and sometimes the yards of the mainmast struck the\ncrests of the waves. At one moment the crew thought the yacht would\nnot rise again. Already the sailors, hatchet in hand, were rushing\nto cut away the fore-shrouds, when they were violently torn from\ntheir fastenings by the blast. The ship righted herself, but, without\nsupport on the waves, she was tossed about so terribly that the masts\nthreatened to break at their very foundations. She could not long\nendure such rolling; she was growing weak, and soon her shattered sides\nand opening seams must give way for the water. [Illustration: Then, impelled by the hurricane, the billows outran\nher; they leaped over the taffrail, and the whole deck was swept with\ntremendous violence.] [Sidenote: NEARING THE END.] Captain Mangles had but one resource,--to rig a storm-jib. He succeeded\nafter several hours' labor, but it was not until three o'clock in the\nafternoon that the jib was hauled to the main-stay and set to the\nwind. With this piece of canvas the Duncan flew before the wind\nwith inconceivable rapidity. It was necessary to keep up the greatest\npossible speed, for upon this alone depended her safety. Sometimes,\noutstripping the waves, she cut them with her slender prow and plunged\nbeneath them, like an enormous sea-monster, while the water swept\nher deck from stem to stern. At other times her swiftness barely\nequaled that of the surges, her rudder lost all power, and she gave\nterrific lurches that threatened to capsize her. Then, impelled by the\nhurricane, the billows outran her; they leaped over the taffrail, and\nthe whole deck was swept with tremendous violence. The situation was indeed alarming. The captain would not leave his\npost for an instant. He was tortured by fears that his impassive face\nwould not betray, and persistently sought to penetrate with his gaze\nthe gathering gloom. And he had good cause for fear. The Duncan, driven\nout of her course, was running towards the Australian coast with a\nswiftness that nothing could arrest. He felt, too, as if by instinct,\nthat a strong current was drawing him along. At every moment he feared\nthe shock of a reef upon which the yacht would be dashed into a\nthousand pieces, and he calculated that the shore was not more than a\ndozen miles to leeward. Finally he went in search of Lord Glenarvan, consulted with him in\nprivate, explained their actual situation, viewed it with the coolness\nof a sailor who is ready for any emergency, and ended by saying that he\nshould be obliged perhaps to run the Duncan ashore. \"To save those she carries, if possible, my lord,\" he added. \"Very well, captain,\" replied Glenarvan. \"And Lady Helena and Miss Grant?\" \"I will inform them only at the last moment, when all hope is gone of\nkeeping at sea. You will tell me.\" \"I will, my lord.\" Glenarvan returned to the ladies, who, without knowing all the danger,\nfelt it to be imminent. They displayed, however, a noble courage, equal\nat least to that of their companions.

After his examination of the hull, the captain\nperceived that it had been little injured in stranding. It was probable\nthat a part of the false keel would remain in the sand, but they could\npass over it. Wilson, after inspecting the interior of the brig, dived, in order to\ndetermine her position on the reef. The Macquarie was turned towards\nthe northwest, and lay on a very shelving, slimy sand-bar. The lower\nend of her prow and two-thirds of her keel were deeply imbedded in\nthe sand. The rest, as far as the stern, floated where the water was\nfive fathoms deep. The rudder was not, therefore, confined, but worked\nfreely. The captain considered it useless to lighten her, as he hoped\nthey would be ready to make use of her at the earliest opportunity. The tides of the Pacific are not very strong, but he relied upon their\ninfluence to float the brig, which had stranded an hour before high\nwater. The only point was to extricate her, which would be a long and\npainful task. [Sidenote: LABOR FOR THE COMMON WEAL.] \"To work!\" cried the captain. His improvised sailors were ready. He ordered them to reef the sails. The major, Robert, and Paganel, under Wilson's direction, climbed\nthe maintop. The top-sail, swelled by the wind, would have prevented\nthe extrication of the ship, and it was necessary to reef it, which\nwas done as well as possible. At last, after much labor, severe to\nunaccustomed hands, the maintop-gallant was taken down. Young Robert,\nnimble as a cat, and bold as a cabin-boy, had rendered important\nservices in this difficult operation. It was now advisable to cast one anchor, perhaps two, at the stern of\nthe vessel in the line of the keel. The effect of this would be to\nhaul the Macquarie around into deep water. There is no difficulty in\ndoing this when you have a boat, but here all the boats were gone, and\nsomething else must be supplied. Glenarvan was familiar enough with the sea to understand the necessity\nof these arrangements. One anchor was to be cast to prevent the ship\nfrom stranding at low water. \"But what shall we do without a boat?\" asked he of the captain. \"We will use the remains of the mizen-mast and the empty casks,\" was\nthe reply. \"It will be a difficult, but not impossible task, for the\nMacquarie's anchors are small. Once cast however, if they do not drag,\nI shall be encouraged.\" \"Very well, let us lose no time.\" To accomplish their object, all were summoned on deck; each took\npart in the work. The rigging that still confined the mizen-mast was\ncut away, so that the maintop could be easily withdrawn. Out of this\nplatform Captain Mangles designed to make a raft. He supported it by\nmeans of empty casks, and rendered it capable of carrying the anchors. A rudder was fastened to it, which enabled them to steer the concern. This labor was half accomplished when the sun neared the meridian. The captain left Glenarvan to follow out his instructions, and turned\nhis attention to determining his position, which was very important. Fortunately, he had found in Will Halley's cabin a Nautical Almanac and\na sextant, with which he was able to take an observation. By consulting\nthe map Paganel had bought at Eden, he saw that they had been wrecked\nat the mouth of Aotea Bay, above Cahua Point, on the shores of the\nprovince of Auckland.", "similarity": 0.5088112354278564}, {"chunk_id": 230, "text": "\"But what did you think?\" asked Glenarvan. \"I thought, my lord, that, in the cause of Captain Grant, it was\nnecessary to go wherever you directed me; that by some combination of\ncircumstances another vessel would take you to New Zealand, and that\nI was to wait for you on the eastern coast of the island. Moreover,\non leaving Melbourne, I kept my destination secret, and the crew did\nnot know it till we were out at sea and the shores of Australia had\ndisappeared from sight. But then an incident occurred that perplexed me\nvery much.\" \"What do you mean, Tom?\" inquired Glenarvan. \"I mean,\" he replied, \"that when the quartermaster, Ayrton, learned,\nthe day after our departure, the Duncan's destination----\"\n\n\"Ayrton!\" cried Glenarvan. \"Is he on board?\" \"Yes, my lord.\" \"Ayrton here!\" repeated Glenarvan, glancing at Captain Mangles. \"Wonderful indeed!\" said the young captain. In an instant, with the swiftness of lightning, Ayrton's conduct, his\nlong-contrived treachery, Glenarvan's wound, the attack upon Mulready,\ntheir sufferings in the marshes of the Snowy, all the wretch's deeds,\nflashed upon the minds of the two men. And now, by a strange fatality,\nthe convict was in their power. \"Where is he?\" asked Glenarvan quickly. \"In a cabin in the forecastle,\" replied Tom Austin, \"closely guarded.\" \"Why this confinement?\" [Sidenote: AN UNOFFICIAL TRIBUNAL.] \"Because, when Ayrton saw that the yacht was sailing for New Zealand,\nhe flew into a passion; because he attempted to force me to change the\nship's course; because he threatened me; and, finally, because he urged\nmy men to a mutiny. I saw that he was a dangerous person, and was\ncompelled, therefore, to take precautions against him.\" \"And since that time?\" \"Since that time he has been in his cabin, without offering to come\nout.\" \"Good!\" At this moment Glenarvan and Captain Mangles were summoned to the\nsaloon. Breakfast, which they so much needed, was ready. They took\nseats at the table, but did not speak of Ayrton. However, when the meal was ended, and the passengers had assembled on\ndeck, Glenarvan informed them of the quartermaster's presence on board. At the same time he declared his intention of sending for him. \"Can I be released from attending this tribunal?\" asked Lady Helena. \"I confess to you, my dear Edward, that the sight of this unfortunate\nwould be very painful to me.\" \"It is only to confront him, Helena,\" replied Glenarvan. \"Remain,\nif you can. Ben Joyce should see himself face to face with all his\nintended victims.\" Lady Helena yielded to this request, and Mary Grant and she took their\nplaces beside him, while around them stood the major, Paganel, Captain\nMangles, Robert, Wilson, Mulready, and Olbinett, all who had suffered\nso severely by the convict's treason. The crew of the yacht, who did\nnot yet understand the seriousness of these proceedings, maintained a\nprofound silence. \"Call Ayrton!\" said Glenarvan. CHAPTER LVI. AYRTON'S OBSTINACY. Ayrton soon made his appearance. He crossed the deck with a confident\nstep, and ascended the poop-stairs. His eyes had a sullen look, his\nteeth were set, and his fists clinched convulsively. His bearing\ndisplayed neither exultation nor humility. As soon as he was in Lord\nGlenarvan's presence, he folded his arms, and calmly and silently\nwaited to be questioned:\n\n\"Ayrton,\" said Glenarvan, \"here we all are, as you see, on board the\nDuncan, that you would have surrendered to Ben Joyce's accomplices.\" At these words the lips of the quartermaster slightly trembled.", "similarity": 0.5843877792358398}, {"chunk_id": 170, "text": "By the flash of\nthe report, he recognized Ben Joyce, but that was all.

The assassins believed him dead. He felt them search\nhim. Then a conversation ensued. \"I have the letter,\" said one of them. \"Give it to me,\" replied Ben Joyce; \"and now the Duncan is ours!\" At this point in the story Glenarvan could not restrain a cry. MacNabb continued:\n\n[Sidenote: A HOPELESS CHANCE.] \"'Now, you others,' said Ben Joyce, 'catch the horse. In two days I\nshall be on board the Duncan, and in six at Twofold Bay. There is the\nplace of meeting. The lord's party will be still fast in the marshes\nof the Snowy. Cross the river at Kemple Pier bridge, go to the coast,\nand wait for me. I will find means to bring you on board. With the\ncrew once at sea, and a vessel like the Duncan, we shall be masters\nof the Indian Ocean.' 'Hurrah for Ben Joyce!' cried the convicts. Mulready's horse was then led up, and Ben Joyce disappeared at a gallop\non the Lucknow road, while the band proceeded southeastward to the\nSnowy River. Mulready, although severely wounded, had strength to drag\nhimself within two hundred paces of the encampment, where we picked him\nup almost dead. This,\" added MacNabb, \"is Mulready's sad story. You\nunderstand now why the courageous sailor wished so much to speak.\" This revelation terrified all. \"Pirates! pirates!\" cried Glenarvan. \"My crew massacred, my Duncan in\nthe hands of these bandits!\" \"Yes, for Ben Joyce will surprise the vessel,\" replied the major, \"and\nthen----\"\n\n\"Well, we must reach the coast before these wretches,\" said Paganel. \"But how cross the Snowy?\" asked Wilson. \"Like them,\" answered Glenarvan. \"They will cross Kemple Pier bridge,\nand we will do the same.\" \"But what will become of Mulready?\" inquired Lady Helena. \"We will take turns in carrying him. Shall I give up my defenceless\ncrew to Ben Joyce's band?\" The plan of crossing Kemple Pier bridge was practicable, but perilous. The convicts might locate themselves at this point to defend it. It\nwould be at least thirty against seven! But there are moments when we\ndo not think of these things, when we must advance at all hazards. \"My lord,\" said Captain Mangles, at length, \"before risking our\nlast chance, before venturing towards the bridge, it is prudent to\nreconnoitre it first. I will undertake this.\" \"I will accompany you, captain,\" replied Paganel. [Sidenote: THE BURNED BRIDGE.] This proposal was accepted, and the captain and Paganel prepared to\nstart immediately. They were to follow along the bank of the river till\nthey came to the place indicated by Ben Joyce, and keep out of sight\nof the convicts, who were probably lying in wait. These two courageous\nmen accordingly, well furnished with arms and provisions, set out, and\nsoon disappeared among the tall rushes of the river. [Illustration: The animal reared. Mulready seized his revolver and\nfired.] All day the little party waited for them. At evening they had not yet\nreturned, and great fears were entertained. At last, about eleven\no'clock, Wilson announced their approach. They arrived, worn out with\nthe fatigues of a six-mile journey. \"The bridge? Is it there?\" asked Glenarvan, rushing to meet them. \"Yes, a bridge of rushes,\" said Captain Mangles. \"The convicts passed,\nit is true, but----\"\n\n\"But what?\" cried Glenarvan, who foresaw a new calamity. \"They burned it after their passage,\" replied Paganel.

He has stolen\nhis name and contract?\" All eyes were turned towards MacNabb, who must have considered this\nmatter. \"These,\" replied he, in his calm voice, \"are the proofs that can be\nderived from this obscure state of affairs. In my opinion this man's\nreal name is Ayrton. Ben Joyce is his fighting title. It is certain\nthat he knows Harry Grant, and has been quartermaster on board the\nBritannia. These facts, proved already by the precise details given\nby Ayrton, are still further corroborated by the conversation of the\nconvicts that I have related. Let us not, therefore, be led astray\nby vain conjectures, but only be certain that Ayrton is Ben Joyce, a\nsailor of the Britannia, now chief of a band of convicts.\" The major's explanation was accepted as conclusive. \"Now,\" replied Glenarvan, \"will you tell me how and why Harry Grant's\nquartermaster is in Australia?\" \"How, I do not know,\" said MacNabb; \"and the police declare they know\nno more than I on the subject. Why, it is also impossible for me to\nsay.

His past had\njust been reviewed by the major, and the wretch appeared as he was,--a\nbold and formidable criminal. His intentions had been clearly proved,\nand required, on the part of Glenarvan, extreme vigilance. Fortunately,\nthere was less to fear from the detected bandit than the secret traitor. But one serious fact appeared from this explanation. No one had yet\nthought of it; only Mary Grant, disregarding the past, looked forward\nto the future. Captain Mangles first saw her pale and disconsolate. He\nunderstood what was passing in her mind. \"Miss Mary!\" cried he, \"you are weeping!\" \"What is the matter, my child?\" asked Lady Helena. \"My father, madam, my father!\" replied the young girl.

He had just reached this part of his letter, when the major, who had\nbeen looking over his shoulder, asked him, in a singular tone, how he\nwrote the word Ayrton. \"As it is pronounced,\" replied Glenarvan. \"That is a mistake,\" said the major coolly. \"It is pronounced Ayrton,\nbut it is written 'Ben Joyce'!\" CHAPTER XLI.

The shipwrecked sailor, prisoner of a native tribe, was\ncarried into the interior regions watered by the Darling. Here he led\na very wretched existence, because the tribe itself was miserable; but\nhe was not maltreated. For two long years he endured a painful slavery.

One night\nin October he eluded the vigilance of the natives, and took refuge\nin the depths of extensive forests. For a month, living on roots,\nedible ferns, and the gum of the mimosa, often overcome by despair,\nhe wandered in those vast solitudes, with the sun as his guide by\nday and the stars by night. In this way he crossed marshes, rivers,\nmountains, in short, all that uninhabited portion of country that few\ntravelers have explored. At last, exhausted and almost dead, he reached\nthe hospitable dwelling of Mr. O'Moore, where his labor insured him a\ncomfortable livelihood. \"And if Ayrton is pleased with me,\" said the Irish colonist, when the\nstory was finished, \"I cannot but be pleased with him.

Your advice, Ayrton, would be particularly valuable,\nand I should be much obliged if you would give it to us.\" The sailor reflected a few moments, and then replied:\n\n\"I thank you, my lord, for the confidence you place in me, and hope to\nshow myself worthy of it.", "similarity": 0.5010967254638672}, {"chunk_id": 170, "text": "By the flash of\nthe report, he recognized Ben Joyce, but that was all.

Then a conversation ensued. \"I have the letter,\" said one of them. \"Give it to me,\" replied Ben Joyce; \"and now the Duncan is ours!\" At this point in the story Glenarvan could not restrain a cry. MacNabb continued:\n\n[Sidenote: A HOPELESS CHANCE.] \"'Now, you others,' said Ben Joyce, 'catch the horse. In two days I\nshall be on board the Duncan, and in six at Twofold Bay.

I will find means to bring you on board. With the\ncrew once at sea, and a vessel like the Duncan, we shall be masters\nof the Indian Ocean.' 'Hurrah for Ben Joyce!' cried the convicts. Mulready's horse was then led up, and Ben Joyce disappeared at a gallop\non the Lucknow road, while the band proceeded southeastward to the\nSnowy River. Mulready, although severely wounded, had strength to drag\nhimself within two hundred paces of the encampment, where we picked him\nup almost dead. This,\" added MacNabb, \"is Mulready's sad story. You\nunderstand now why the courageous sailor wished so much to speak.\" This revelation terrified all. \"Pirates! pirates!\" cried Glenarvan. \"My crew massacred, my Duncan in\nthe hands of these bandits!\" \"Yes, for Ben Joyce will surprise the vessel,\" replied the major, \"and\nthen----\"\n\n\"Well, we must reach the coast before these wretches,\" said Paganel. \"But how cross the Snowy?\" asked Wilson. \"Like them,\" answered Glenarvan. \"They will cross Kemple Pier bridge,\nand we will do the same.\" \"But what will become of Mulready?\" inquired Lady Helena. \"We will take turns in carrying him. Shall I give up my defenceless\ncrew to Ben Joyce's band?\" The plan of crossing Kemple Pier bridge was practicable, but perilous. The convicts might locate themselves at this point to defend it. It\nwould be at least thirty against seven! But there are moments when we\ndo not think of these things, when we must advance at all hazards. \"My lord,\" said Captain Mangles, at length, \"before risking our\nlast chance, before venturing towards the bridge, it is prudent to\nreconnoitre it first. I will undertake this.\" \"I will accompany you, captain,\" replied Paganel. [Sidenote: THE BURNED BRIDGE.] This proposal was accepted, and the captain and Paganel prepared to\nstart immediately.

These two courageous\nmen accordingly, well furnished with arms and provisions, set out, and\nsoon disappeared among the tall rushes of the river. [Illustration: The animal reared.

He ordered the mate of the Duncan to repair without delay to Twofold\nBay, and recommended the quartermaster to him as a man in whom he could\nplace entire confidence. As soon as he arrived at the bay, he was to\nsend a detachment of sailors under the command of Ayrton. He had just reached this part of his letter, when the major, who had\nbeen looking over his shoulder, asked him, in a singular tone, how he\nwrote the word Ayrton. \"As it is pronounced,\" replied Glenarvan. \"That is a mistake,\" said the major coolly. \"It is pronounced Ayrton,\nbut it is written 'Ben Joyce'!\" CHAPTER XLI. THE PLOT UNVEILED. The sound of the name of Ben Joyce fell upon the party like a\nthunderbolt. Ayrton suddenly sprang to his feet. In his hand was a\nrevolver. A report was heard; and Glenarvan fell, struck by a bullet. Before Captain Mangles and the sailors recovered from the surprise into\nwhich this unexpected turn of affairs had thrown them, the audacious\nconvict had escaped, and joined his band, scattered along the edge of\nthe wood of gum-trees. [Illustration: A report was heard; and Glenarvan fell, struck by a\nbullet.] The tent did not offer a sufficient shelter against the bullets, and\nit was clearly necessary to beat a retreat. Glenarvan, who was but\nslightly injured, had risen. \"To the cart! to the cart!\" cried Captain Mangles, as he hurried on\nLady Helena and Mary Grant, who were soon in safety behind its stout\nsides. The captain, the major, Paganel, and the sailors then seized their\nrifles, and stood ready to repel the convicts. Glenarvan and Robert had\njoined the ladies, while Olbinett hastened to the common defence. These events had transpired with the rapidity of lightning. Captain\nMangles attentively watched the edge of the wood; but the reports\nsuddenly ceased on the arrival of Ben Joyce, and a profound silence\nsucceeded the noisy fusillade. A few wreaths of white smoke were still\ncurling up between the branches of the gum-trees, but the tall tufts of\ngastrolobium were motionless and all signs of attack had disappeared. The major and Captain Mangles extended their examinations as far as the\ngreat trees. The place was abandoned. Numerous footprints were seen,\nand a few half-burnt cartridges smoked on the ground. The major, like\na prudent man, extinguished them, for a spark was enough to kindle a\nformidable conflagration in this forest of dry trees. \"The convicts have disappeared,\" said Captain Mangles. \"Yes,\" replied the major; \"and this disappearance alarms me. I should\nprefer to meet them face to face. It is better to encounter a tiger in\nthe open plain than a serpent in the grass. Let us search these bushes\naround the cart.\" [Sidenote: UNRAVELINGS.] The major and captain scoured the surrounding country. But from the\nedge of the wood to the banks of the Snowy they did not meet with a\nsingle convict. Ben Joyce's band seemed to have flown away, like a\nflock of mischievous birds. This disappearance was too strange to\ninspire a perfect security. They therefore resolved to keep on the\nwatch. The cart, which was a really immovable fortress, became the\ncentre of the encampment, and two men kept guard, relieving each other\nevery hour. Lady Helena and Mary Grant's first care had been to dress Glenarvan's\nwound.", "similarity": 0.5622153878211975}, {"chunk_id": 110, "text": "Vain hope! At eight o'clock in the\nmorning it was still blowing hard, and the wind soon became a hurricane. The captain said nothing, but he trembled for his vessel and those\nwhom she carried. The Duncan now and then gave a fearful lurch; her\nstanchions cracked, and sometimes the yards of the mainmast struck the\ncrests of the waves. At one moment the crew thought the yacht would\nnot rise again. Already the sailors, hatchet in hand, were rushing\nto cut away the fore-shrouds, when they were violently torn from\ntheir fastenings by the blast. The ship righted herself, but, without\nsupport on the waves, she was tossed about so terribly that the masts\nthreatened to break at their very foundations. She could not long\nendure such rolling; she was growing weak, and soon her shattered sides\nand opening seams must give way for the water. [Illustration: Then, impelled by the hurricane, the billows outran\nher; they leaped over the taffrail, and the whole deck was swept with\ntremendous violence.] [Sidenote: NEARING THE END.] Captain Mangles had but one resource,--to rig a storm-jib. He succeeded\nafter several hours' labor, but it was not until three o'clock in the\nafternoon that the jib was hauled to the main-stay and set to the\nwind. With this piece of canvas the Duncan flew before the wind\nwith inconceivable rapidity. It was necessary to keep up the greatest\npossible speed, for upon this alone depended her safety. Sometimes,\noutstripping the waves, she cut them with her slender prow and plunged\nbeneath them, like an enormous sea-monster, while the water swept\nher deck from stem to stern. At other times her swiftness barely\nequaled that of the surges, her rudder lost all power, and she gave\nterrific lurches that threatened to capsize her. Then, impelled by the\nhurricane, the billows outran her; they leaped over the taffrail, and\nthe whole deck was swept with tremendous violence. The situation was indeed alarming. The captain would not leave his\npost for an instant. He was tortured by fears that his impassive face\nwould not betray, and persistently sought to penetrate with his gaze\nthe gathering gloom. And he had good cause for fear. The Duncan, driven\nout of her course, was running towards the Australian coast with a\nswiftness that nothing could arrest. He felt, too, as if by instinct,\nthat a strong current was drawing him along. At every moment he feared\nthe shock of a reef upon which the yacht would be dashed into a\nthousand pieces, and he calculated that the shore was not more than a\ndozen miles to leeward. Finally he went in search of Lord Glenarvan, consulted with him in\nprivate, explained their actual situation, viewed it with the coolness\nof a sailor who is ready for any emergency, and ended by saying that he\nshould be obliged perhaps to run the Duncan ashore. \"To save those she carries, if possible, my lord,\" he added. \"Very well, captain,\" replied Glenarvan. \"And Lady Helena and Miss Grant?\" \"I will inform them only at the last moment, when all hope is gone of\nkeeping at sea. You will tell me.\" \"I will, my lord.\" Glenarvan returned to the ladies, who, without knowing all the danger,\nfelt it to be imminent. They displayed, however, a noble courage, equal\nat least to that of their companions.

Moreover,\non leaving Melbourne, I kept my destination secret, and the crew did\nnot know it till we were out at sea and the shores of Australia had\ndisappeared from sight. But then an incident occurred that perplexed me\nvery much.\" \"What do you mean, Tom?\" inquired Glenarvan. \"I mean,\" he replied, \"that when the quartermaster, Ayrton, learned,\nthe day after our departure, the Duncan's destination----\"\n\n\"Ayrton!\" cried Glenarvan. \"Is he on board?\" \"Yes, my lord.\" \"Ayrton here!\" repeated Glenarvan, glancing at Captain Mangles. \"Wonderful indeed!\" said the young captain. In an instant, with the swiftness of lightning, Ayrton's conduct, his\nlong-contrived treachery, Glenarvan's wound, the attack upon Mulready,\ntheir sufferings in the marshes of the Snowy, all the wretch's deeds,\nflashed upon the minds of the two men. And now, by a strange fatality,\nthe convict was in their power. \"Where is he?\" asked Glenarvan quickly. \"In a cabin in the forecastle,\" replied Tom Austin, \"closely guarded.\" \"Why this confinement?\" [Sidenote: AN UNOFFICIAL TRIBUNAL.] \"Because, when Ayrton saw that the yacht was sailing for New Zealand,\nhe flew into a passion; because he attempted to force me to change the\nship's course; because he threatened me; and, finally, because he urged\nmy men to a mutiny. I saw that he was a dangerous person, and was\ncompelled, therefore, to take precautions against him.\" \"And since that time?\" \"Since that time he has been in his cabin, without offering to come\nout.\" \"Good!\" At this moment Glenarvan and Captain Mangles were summoned to the\nsaloon. Breakfast, which they so much needed, was ready. They took\nseats at the table, but did not speak of Ayrton. However, when the meal was ended, and the passengers had assembled on\ndeck, Glenarvan informed them of the quartermaster's presence on board. At the same time he declared his intention of sending for him. \"Can I be released from attending this tribunal?\" asked Lady Helena. \"I confess to you, my dear Edward, that the sight of this unfortunate\nwould be very painful to me.\" \"It is only to confront him, Helena,\" replied Glenarvan. \"Remain,\nif you can. Ben Joyce should see himself face to face with all his\nintended victims.\" Lady Helena yielded to this request, and Mary Grant and she took their\nplaces beside him, while around them stood the major, Paganel, Captain\nMangles, Robert, Wilson, Mulready, and Olbinett, all who had suffered\nso severely by the convict's treason. The crew of the yacht, who did\nnot yet understand the seriousness of these proceedings, maintained a\nprofound silence. \"Call Ayrton!\" said Glenarvan. CHAPTER LVI. AYRTON'S OBSTINACY. Ayrton soon made his appearance. He crossed the deck with a confident\nstep, and ascended the poop-stairs. His eyes had a sullen look, his\nteeth were set, and his fists clinched convulsively. His bearing\ndisplayed neither exultation nor humility. As soon as he was in Lord\nGlenarvan's presence, he folded his arms, and calmly and silently\nwaited to be questioned:\n\n\"Ayrton,\" said Glenarvan, \"here we all are, as you see, on board the\nDuncan, that you would have surrendered to Ben Joyce's accomplices.\" At these words the lips of the quartermaster slightly trembled.", "similarity": 0.5265771150588989}, {"chunk_id": 162, "text": "I knew what\nI wished, and returned to the encampment with the certainty that all\nthe convicts in Australia are not reformed, in spite of Paganel's\narguments.\" \"Then,\" said Glenarvan, whose face was pale with anger, \"Ayrton has\nbrought us here to rob and assassinate us?\" \"Yes,\" replied the major. \"And, since leaving the Wimerra, his band has followed and watched us,\nwaiting for a favorable opportunity?\" [Sidenote: FROM DEPTH TO DEPTH.] \"Yes.\" \"But this wretch is not, then, a sailor of the Britannia? He has stolen\nhis name and contract?\" All eyes were turned towards MacNabb, who must have considered this\nmatter. \"These,\" replied he, in his calm voice, \"are the proofs that can be\nderived from this obscure state of affairs. In my opinion this man's\nreal name is Ayrton. Ben Joyce is his fighting title. It is certain\nthat he knows Harry Grant, and has been quartermaster on board the\nBritannia. These facts, proved already by the precise details given\nby Ayrton, are still further corroborated by the conversation of the\nconvicts that I have related. Let us not, therefore, be led astray\nby vain conjectures, but only be certain that Ayrton is Ben Joyce, a\nsailor of the Britannia, now chief of a band of convicts.\" The major's explanation was accepted as conclusive. \"Now,\" replied Glenarvan, \"will you tell me how and why Harry Grant's\nquartermaster is in Australia?\" \"How, I do not know,\" said MacNabb; \"and the police declare they know\nno more than I on the subject. Why, it is also impossible for me to\nsay. Here is a mystery that the future will explain.\" \"The police do not even know the identity of Ayrton and Ben Joyce,\"\nsaid Captain Mangles. \"You are right, John,\" replied the major; \"and such information would\nbe likely to facilitate their search.\" \"This unfortunate, then,\" remarked Lady Helena, \"intruded into\nO'Moore's farm with a criminal intention?\" \"There is no doubt of it,\" continued MacNabb. \"He was meditating\nsome hostile attack upon the Irishman, when a better opportunity was\noffered. Chance threw us in his way. He heard Glenarvan's story of the\nshipwreck, and, like a bold man, he promptly decided to take part in\nthe expedition. At the Wimerra he communicated with one of his friends,\nthe farrier of Black Point, and thus left distinguishable traces of\nour course. His band followed us. A poisonous plant enabled him to\ngradually kill our oxen and horses. Then, at the proper moment, he\nentangled us in the marshes of the Snowy, and surrendered us to the\nconvicts he commanded.\" Everything possible had been said concerning Ben Joyce. His past had\njust been reviewed by the major, and the wretch appeared as he was,--a\nbold and formidable criminal. His intentions had been clearly proved,\nand required, on the part of Glenarvan, extreme vigilance. Fortunately,\nthere was less to fear from the detected bandit than the secret traitor. But one serious fact appeared from this explanation. No one had yet\nthought of it; only Mary Grant, disregarding the past, looked forward\nto the future. Captain Mangles first saw her pale and disconsolate. He\nunderstood what was passing in her mind. \"Miss Mary!\" cried he, \"you are weeping!\" \"What is the matter, my child?\" asked Lady Helena. \"My father, madam, my father!\" replied the young girl. She could not continue. But a sudden revelation dawned on the mind of\neach. They comprehended Mary's grief, why the tears flowed from her\neyes, why the name of her father rose to her lips.

The latter continued, with more animation:\n\n\"Permit me to shake hands with you, and if I did not do so day before\nyesterday, it was that no one might be embarrassed at the moment of\ndeparture. But to-day, captain, I am truly happy to meet you.\" Captain Mangles opened his eyes in measureless astonishment, looking\nfirst at Olbinett, and then at the new comer. \"Now,\" continued the latter, \"the introduction is over, and we are old\nfriends. Let us have a talk; and tell me, are you satisfied with the\nScotia?\" \"What do you mean by the Scotia?\" asked the captain, at last. \"Why, the Scotia that carries us: a good ship, whose commander, the\nbrave Captain Burton, I have heard praised no less for his physical\nthan his moral qualities. Are you the father of the great African\ntraveler of that name? If so, my compliments!\" \"Sir,\" replied Captain Mangles, \"not only am I not the father of the\ntraveler Burton, but I am not even Captain Burton.\" \"Ah!\" said the unknown, \"it is the mate of the Scotia then, Mr.\nBurdness, whom I am addressing at this moment?\" \"Mr. Burdness?\" replied Captain Mangles, who began to suspect the\ntruth. But was he talking to a fool, or a rogue? This was a question in\nhis mind, and he was about to explain himself intelligibly, when Lord\nGlenarvan, his wife, and Miss Grant came on deck. The stranger perceived them, and cried,--\n\n\"Ah! passengers! passengers! excellent! I hope, Mr. Burdness, you are\ngoing to introduce me----\"\n\nAnd advancing with perfect ease, without waiting for the captain,--\n\n\"Madam\" said he to Miss Grant, \"Miss\" to Lady Helena, \"Sir\" he added,\naddressing Lord Glenarvan. \"Lord Glenarvan,\" said Captain Mangles. \"My lord,\" continued the unknown, \"I beg your pardon for introducing\nmyself, but at sea we must relax a little from etiquette. I hope we\nshall soon be acquainted, and that, in the society of these ladies, the\npassage of the Scotia will seem as short to us as agreeable.\" Lady Helena and Miss Grant could not find a word to answer. They were\ncompletely bewildered by the presence of this intruder. \"Sir,\" said Glenarvan, at length, \"whom have I the honor of addressing?\" \"Jacques Eliacim François Marie Paganel, secretary of the Geographical\nSociety of Paris; corresponding member of the societies of Berlin,\nBombay, Darmstadt, Leipsic, London, St. Petersburg, Vienna, and New\nYork; honorary member of the Royal Geographical and Ethnographical\nInstitute of the East Indies, who, after passing twenty years of his\nlife in studying geography, designs now to enter upon a roving life,\nand is directing his course to India to continue there the labors of\nthe great travelers.\" CHAPTER VII. JACQUES PAGANEL IS UNDECEIVED. The secretary of the Geographical Society must have been an agreeable\nperson, for all this was said with much modesty.

His eccentricities (and his abilities) made him much talked of in\nScotland. People seemed as though they could not show him enough\nattention. Just at this time an amiable lady of thirty, none other than the\nmajor's cousin, a little eccentric herself, but still agreeable and\ncharming, fell in love with the geographer's peculiarities. Paganel was\nfar from being insensible to Miss Arabella's attractions, yet did not\ndare to declare his sentiments. The major accordingly undertook the\npart of Cupid's messenger between these two congenial hearts, and even\ntold Paganel that marriage was \"the last blunder\" that he could commit. But the geographer was very much embarrassed, and, strangely enough,\ncould not summon courage to speak for himself.

I should like to find a defect.\" \"Be easy,\" answered the major; \"she has more than one. The most perfect\nwoman always has her share. Well, then, Paganel, are you decided?\" \"I do not dare.\" \"But, my learned friend, why do you hesitate?\" \"I am unworthy of her!\" was the geographer's invariable reply. At last, one day, driven desperate by the irrepressible major, Paganel\nconfessed to him, under the pledge of secrecy, a peculiarity that would\nfacilitate his identification, if the police should ever be on his\ntrack! \"Bah!\" exclaimed the major. \"It is as I tell you,\" persisted Paganel. \"What matter, my worthy friend?\" \"Is that your opinion?\" \"On the contrary, you are only more remarkable. This adds to your\npersonal advantages.

In short, it reached the ear of Mrs. Olbinett, and\nspread. Jacques Paganel, during his three days' captivity among the Maoris, had\nbeen tattooed from head to foot, and bore on his breast the picture of\nan heraldic kiwi with outstretched wings, in the act of biting at his\nheart. This was the only adventure of his great voyage for which Paganel\ncould never be consoled or pardon the New Zealanders.

Not until supper was over, and Lady\nHelena, Mary, and Robert had retired to their chambers, did the major\nsay to his companions:\n\n\"They have traced the authors of the crime committed at Camden Bridge.\" \"Have they been arrested?\" asked Ayrton, quickly. \"No,\" replied MacNabb, without seeming to notice the eagerness of the\nquartermaster. \"So much the worse,\" added Ayrton. \"Well,\" inquired Glenarvan, \"to whom do they attribute the crime?\" \"Read,\" said the major, handing to Glenarvan a copy of the _Australian\nand New Zealand Gazette_, \"and you will see that the police-officer was\nnot mistaken.\" Glenarvan read aloud the following passage:\n\n\"Sydney, Jan. 2, 1865.--It will be remembered that on the night of\nDecember 29 an accident took place at Camden Bridge, five miles from\nCastlemaine Station, on the Melbourne and Sandhurst Railway, by which\nthe night express was precipitated at full speed into the Lutton River. Numerous thefts committed after the accident, and the corpse of the\nguard found half a mile above, prove that it was the result of a crime;\nand, in accordance with the verdict at the inquest, this crime is to\nbe attributed to a band of convicts who escaped, six months ago, from\nthe Perth penitentiary, in Western Australia, as they were about to\nbe transferred to Norfolk Island. These convicts are twenty-nine in\nnumber, and are commanded by a certain Ben Joyce, a dangerous criminal,\nwho arrived in Australia several months ago in some way, and upon whom\njustice has not yet succeeded in laying hands. The inhabitants of the\ncities, and the colonists and squatters of the stations, are warned\nto be on their guard, and requested to send to the undersigned any\ninformation which may assist his investigations. \"J. P. MITCHELL, Surveyor-General.\" *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen Glenarvan had finished reading this article, MacNabb turned to the\ngeographer and said:\n\n\"You see, Paganel, that there may yet be convicts in Australia.\"", "similarity": 0.4514541029930115}, {"chunk_id": 216, "text": "Paganel wondered whether he should\nconsider himself a prisoner; but seeing that he could not take a step\nwithout being graciously accompanied by the chief, he soon knew how\nmatters stood on this point. The chief, whose name was \"Hihy\" (sunbeam), was not a bad man. The\nspectacles and telescope gave him a high opinion of Paganel, whom he\nattached carefully to his person, not only by his benefits, but by\nstrong flaxen ropes, especially at night. This novel situation lasted three long days. Was he well or badly\ntreated? Both, as he stated without further explanation. In short, he\nwas a prisoner, and, except for the prospect of immediate torture,\nhis condition did not seem more enviable than that of his unfortunate\nfriends. Fortunately, last night he succeeded in biting asunder his ropes and\nescaping. He had witnessed at a distance the burial of the chief,\nknew that he had been interred on the summit of Maunganamu mountain,\nand that it was tabooed in consequence. He therefore resolved to take\nrefuge there, not wishing to leave the place where his companions were\nheld captives. He succeeded in his undertaking, arrived at Kara-Tété's\ntomb, and waited in hope that Providence would in some way deliver his\nfriends. Such was Paganel's story. Did he omit designedly any circumstance\nof his stay among the natives? More than once his embarrassment led\nthem to suspect so. However that might be, he received unanimous\ncongratulations; and as the past was now known, they returned to the\npresent. Their situation was still exceedingly critical. The natives, if they\ndid not venture to climb the mountain, expected that hunger and thirst\nwould force their prisoners to surrender. It was only a matter of time,\nand the savages had great patience. Glenarvan did not disregard the\ndifficulties of his position, but waited for the favorable issue which\nProvidence seemed to promise. And first he wished to examine this improvised fortress; not to defend\nit, for an attack was not to be feared, but that he might find a way of\nescaping. The major and the captain, Robert, Paganel, and himself, took\nthe exact bearings of the mountain. They observed the direction of the\npaths, their branches and declivities. A ridge a mile in length united\nthe Maunganamu to the Wahiti range, and then declined to the plain. Its\nnarrow and winding summit presented the only practicable route, in case\nescape should become possible. If the fugitives could pass this point\nunperceived, under cover of the night, perhaps they might succeed in\nreaching the deep valleys and outwitting the Maoris. But this course offered more than one danger, as they would have to\npass below within gun-shot. The bullets of the natives on the lower\nramparts of the pah might intercept them, and form a barrier that no\none could safely cross. Glenarvan and his friends, as soon as they ventured on the dangerous\npart of the ridge, were saluted with a volley of shots; but only a\nfew wads, borne by the wind, reached them. They were made of printed\npaper. Paganel picked them up out of curiosity, but it was difficult to\ndecipher them. [Sidenote: A STRANGE COLPORTEUR.] \"Why!\" said he, \"do you know, my friends, what these creatures use for\nwads in their guns?\" \"No,\" replied Glenarvan. \"Leaves of the Bible! If this is the use they make of the sacred\nwritings, I pity the missionaries. They will have difficulty in\nfounding Maori libraries.\" \"And what passage of the Scriptures have these natives fired at us?\" asked Glenarvan.", "similarity": 0.39053064584732056}, {"chunk_id": 4, "text": "\"Let us break it,\" said MacNabb. \"I would rather keep it whole,\" replied Glenarvan.

For\nseveral minutes Lord Glenarvan examined them attentively, turned them\nabout in every way, and exposed them to the light of day, observing\nthe least traces of writing spared by the sea. Then he looked at his\nfriends, who were regarding him with anxious eyes. \"There are here,\" said he, \"three distinct documents, probably three\ncopies of the same missive, translated into three different languages:\none English, another French, and the third German. The few words that\nremain leave no doubt on this point.\" \"But these words have at least a meaning?\" said Lady Glenarvan. \"That is difficult to say, my dear Helena. The words traced on these\npapers are very imperfect.\" \"Perhaps they will complete each other,\" said the major. \"That may be,\" replied Captain Mangles. \"It is not probable that the\nwater has obliterated these lines in exactly the same places on each,\nand by comparing these remains of phrases we shall arrive at some\nintelligible meaning.\" \"We will do so,\" said Lord Glenarvan; \"but let us proceed\nsystematically. And, first, here is the English document.\" It showed the following arrangement of lines and words:\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"That does not mean much,\" said the major, with an air of\ndisappointment. \"Whatever it may mean,\" replied the captain, \"it is good English.\" \"There is no doubt of that,\" said his lordship. \"The words _wreck,\naland, this, and, lost_, are perfect. _Cap_ evidently means _captain_,\nreferring to the captain of a shipwrecked vessel.\" \"Let us add,\" said the captain, \"the portions of the words _docu_ and\n_ssistance_, the meaning of which is plain.\" \"Well, something is gained already!\" added Lady Helena. \"Unfortunately,\" replied the major, \"entire lines are wanting. How can\nwe find the name of the lost vessel, or the place of shipwreck?\" \"We shall find them,\" said Lord Edward. \"Very likely,\" answered the major, who was invariably of the opinion of\nevery one else; \"but how?\" \"By comparing one document with another.\" \"Let us see!\" cried Lady Helena.

Eight oars at\nthe bow propelled it up the river, while a man at the stern guided it\nby means of a movable paddle. This man was a native, of tall form, about forty-five years old, with\nbroad breast and powerful limbs. His protruding and deeply furrowed\nbrow, his fierce look and his sinister countenance, showed him to be a\nformidable individual. He was a Maori chief of high rank, as could be seen by the delicate\nand compact tattooing that striped his face and body. Two black\nspirals, starting from the nostrils of his aquiline nose, circled his\ntawny eyes, met on his forehead, and were lost in his abundant hair. His mouth, with its shining teeth, and his chin, were hidden beneath\na net-work of varied colors, while graceful lines wound down to his\nsinewy breast. There was no doubt as to his rank. The sharp albatross bone, used\nby Maori tattooers, had furrowed his face five times, in close and\ndeep lines. That he had reached his fifth promotion was evident from\nhis haughty bearing. A large flaxen mat, ornamented with dog-skins,\nenveloped his person; while a girdle, bloody with his recent conflicts,\nencircled his waist. From his ears dangled ear-rings of green jade, and\naround his neck hung necklaces of \"pounamous,\" sacred stones to which\nthe New Zealanders attribute miraculous properties. At his side lay a\ngun of English manufacture, and a \"patou-patou,\" a kind of double-edged\nhatchet. Near him nine warriors, of lower rank, armed and of ferocious aspect,\nsome still suffering from recent wounds, stood in perfect immobility,\nenveloped in their flaxen mantles. Three dogs of wild appearance were\nstretched at their feet. The eight rowers seemed to be servants or\nslaves of the chief. They worked vigorously, and the boat ascended the\ncurrent of the Waikato with remarkable swiftness. In the centre of this long canoe, with feet tied, but hands free, were\nten European prisoners clinging closely to each other. They were Lord\nGlenarvan and his companions. [Sidenote: A TESTING TIME.] The evening before, the little party, led astray by the dense fog, had\nencamped in the midst of a numerous tribe of natives. About midnight,\nthe travelers, surprised in their sleep, were made prisoners and\ncarried on board the canoe. They had not yet been maltreated, but had\ntried in vain to resist. Their arms and ammunition were in the hands of\nthe savages, and their own bullets would have quickly stretched them on\nthe earth had they attempted to escape. They were not long in learning, by the aid of a few English words which\nthe natives used, that, being driven back by the British troops, they\nwere returning, vanquished and weakened, to the regions of the upper\nWaikato. Their chief, after an obstinate resistance, in which he lost\nhis principal warriors, was now on his way to rouse again the river\ntribes. He was called Kai-Koumou, a terrible name, which signified\nin the native language \"he who eats the limbs of his enemy.\" He was\nbrave and bold, but his cruelty equaled his bravery. No pity could be\nexpected from him. His name was well known to the English soldiers, and\na price had been set upon his head by the governor of New Zealand.

The thick cloud approached, from\nthe midst of which issued a chorus of bleatings, neighings, and\nbellowings, while the human voice mingled in cries and whistles with\nthis pastoral symphony. A man emerged from the noisy multitude; it was\nthe commander-in-chief of this four-footed army. Glenarvan advanced to\nmeet him, and friendly relations were established without ceremony. The leader, or, to give him his real title, the \"stock-keeper,\" was\nproprietor of a part of the herd. His name was Sam Machell, and he\nwas on his way from the eastern provinces to Portland Bay. His cattle\ncomprised one thousand oxen, eleven thousand sheep, and seventy-five\nhorses. All these animals, bought when lean on the plains of the\nBlue Mountains, were to be fattened in the healthy pastures of South\nAustralia, where they would be sold for a large price. Sam Machell briefly told his story, while the drove continued its\ncourse through the clumps of mimosas. Lady Helena, Mary Grant, and\nthe horsemen dismounted, and, seated in the shade of a huge gum-tree,\nlistened to the stock-keeper's narrative. He had set out seven months before, and had made about ten miles a day,\nat which rate his journey would last three months longer. To aid him\nin this laborious task, he had with him twenty dogs and thirty men. Five of the men were blacks, who are very skillful in recovering stray\nanimals. Six carts followed the drove; and the drivers, provided with\nstock-whips, the handles of which were eighteen inches and the lashes\nnine feet in length, moved among the ranks and maintained order, while\nthe canine light dragoons hovered about on the wings. The travelers were amazed at the discipline of this novel army. The\ndifferent classes advanced separately, for wild oxen and sheep do\nnot associate well; the first will never graze where the second have\npassed. Hence it was necessary to place the oxen at the head; and these\naccordingly, divided into two battalions, took the lead. Five regiments\nof sheep, commanded by five drivers, followed, and the platoon of\nhorses formed the rear-guard. The stock-keeper observed to his hearers that the leaders of the army\nwere neither dogs nor men, but oxen, whose superiority was recognized\nby their mates. They advanced in the front rank with perfect gravity,\nchoosing the best course by instinct, and thoroughly convinced of their\nright to be treated with consideration. [Sidenote: AN UNFORESEEN HINDRANCE.] Thus the discipline was maintained, for the drove obeyed them without\nresistance. If it pleased them to stop, the others were obliged to\nyield, and it was useless to attempt to resume the line of march if the\nleaders did not give the signal. Such was Sam Machell's account, during which a great part of the\nherd had advanced in good order. It was now time for him to join his\narmy, and choose the best pastures. He therefore took leave of Lord\nGlenarvan, mounted a fine native horse that one of his men was holding\nfor him, and a few moments after had disappeared in a cloud of dust,\nwhile the cart, resuming its interrupted journey, stopped at nightfall\nat the foot of Mount Talbot.

Of these miserable beings there were about thirty, men, women,\nand children, dressed in ragged kangaroo-skins. Their first movement\nwas one of flight; but a few words from Ayrton restored confidence, and\nthey slowly approached the party of Europeans. The major jocularly insisted that Robert was correct in saying that\nhe had seen a monkey; but Lady Helena declined to accept his views,\nand, getting out of the cart, made friendly advances to these degraded\nbeings, who seemed to look upon her as a divinity.

Of the natives few were seen; only some \"guassos\" (degenerate children\nof the Indians and Spanish), galloping on horses which they lacerated\nwith the gigantic spurs that adorned their naked feet, and passing\nlike shadows. They met on the way no one who could inform them, and\ninquiries were therefore utterly impossible. [Sidenote: AN ASTONISHED CATAPAZ.] Glenarvan thought that Captain Grant, if prisoner of the Indians, must\nhave been carried by them beyond the Andes. Their search could be\nsuccessful only in the Pampas. They must be patient, and travel on\nswiftly and continuously. [Illustration: By means of a ford, they crossed the Rio Tubal, the\nmountains visible in the distance.] They advanced in the same order as before, which Robert with difficulty\nkept, for his eagerness led him to press forward, to the great\nannoyance of his animal. Nothing but a command from Glenarvan would\nkeep the young boy at his place in the line. The country now became\nmore uneven; and several hillocks indicated that they were approaching\nthe mountains. Paganel still continued his study of Spanish. \"What a language it is!\" exclaimed he; \"so full and sonorous!\" \"But you are making progress, of course?\" replied Glenarvan. \"Certainly, my dear lord. Ah! if there were only no accent! But, alas! there is one!\" In studying this language, Paganel did not, however, neglect his\ngeographical observations. In these, indeed, he was astonishingly\nclever, and could not have found his superior. When Glenarvan\nquestioned the catapaz about some peculiarity of the country, his\nlearned companion would always anticipate the answer of the guide, who\nthen gazed at him with a look of amazement. That same day they met a road which crossed the line that they had\nhitherto pursued. Lord Glenarvan naturally asked its name of their\nguide, and Paganel as naturally answered,--\n\n\"The road from Yumbel to Los Angelos.\" Glenarvan looked at the catapaz. \"Exactly,\" replied he. Then, addressing the geographer, he said,--\n\n\"You have traveled in this country?\" \"Certainly,\" replied Paganel gravely. \"On a mule?\" \"No; in an arm-chair.\" The catapaz did not understand, for he shrugged his shoulders and\nreturned to the head of the troop. At five o'clock in the afternoon they stopped in a shallow gorge, a\nfew miles above the little town of Loja; and that night the travelers\nencamped at the foot of the first slopes of the Andes. CHAPTER XII. ELEVEN THOUSAND FEET ALOFT. The route through Chili had as yet presented no serious obstacles; but\nnow the dangers that attend a journey across the mountains suddenly\nincreased, the struggle with the natural difficulties was about to\nbegin in earnest. An important question had to be decided before starting. By what pass\ncould they cross the Andes with the least departure from the prescribed\ncourse? The catapaz was questioned on this subject. \"I know,\" he replied, \"of but two passes that are practicable in this\npart of the Andes.\" \"Doubtless the pass of Arica,\" said Paganel, \"which was discovered by\nValdivia Mendoza.\" \"Exactly.\" \"And that of Villarica, situated to the south of Nevado.\" \"You are right.\" \"Well, my friend, these two passes have only one difficulty; they will\ncarry us to the south, or the north, farther than we wish.\"", "similarity": 0.3751053214073181}, {"chunk_id": 197, "text": "A bed of dry fern covered the bottom. Eight oars at\nthe bow propelled it up the river, while a man at the stern guided it\nby means of a movable paddle. This man was a native, of tall form, about forty-five years old, with\nbroad breast and powerful limbs. His protruding and deeply furrowed\nbrow, his fierce look and his sinister countenance, showed him to be a\nformidable individual. He was a Maori chief of high rank, as could be seen by the delicate\nand compact tattooing that striped his face and body. Two black\nspirals, starting from the nostrils of his aquiline nose, circled his\ntawny eyes, met on his forehead, and were lost in his abundant hair. His mouth, with its shining teeth, and his chin, were hidden beneath\na net-work of varied colors, while graceful lines wound down to his\nsinewy breast. There was no doubt as to his rank. The sharp albatross bone, used\nby Maori tattooers, had furrowed his face five times, in close and\ndeep lines. That he had reached his fifth promotion was evident from\nhis haughty bearing. A large flaxen mat, ornamented with dog-skins,\nenveloped his person; while a girdle, bloody with his recent conflicts,\nencircled his waist. From his ears dangled ear-rings of green jade, and\naround his neck hung necklaces of \"pounamous,\" sacred stones to which\nthe New Zealanders attribute miraculous properties. At his side lay a\ngun of English manufacture, and a \"patou-patou,\" a kind of double-edged\nhatchet. Near him nine warriors, of lower rank, armed and of ferocious aspect,\nsome still suffering from recent wounds, stood in perfect immobility,\nenveloped in their flaxen mantles. Three dogs of wild appearance were\nstretched at their feet. The eight rowers seemed to be servants or\nslaves of the chief. They worked vigorously, and the boat ascended the\ncurrent of the Waikato with remarkable swiftness. In the centre of this long canoe, with feet tied, but hands free, were\nten European prisoners clinging closely to each other. They were Lord\nGlenarvan and his companions. [Sidenote: A TESTING TIME.] The evening before, the little party, led astray by the dense fog, had\nencamped in the midst of a numerous tribe of natives. About midnight,\nthe travelers, surprised in their sleep, were made prisoners and\ncarried on board the canoe. They had not yet been maltreated, but had\ntried in vain to resist. Their arms and ammunition were in the hands of\nthe savages, and their own bullets would have quickly stretched them on\nthe earth had they attempted to escape. They were not long in learning, by the aid of a few English words which\nthe natives used, that, being driven back by the British troops, they\nwere returning, vanquished and weakened, to the regions of the upper\nWaikato. Their chief, after an obstinate resistance, in which he lost\nhis principal warriors, was now on his way to rouse again the river\ntribes. He was called Kai-Koumou, a terrible name, which signified\nin the native language \"he who eats the limbs of his enemy.\" He was\nbrave and bold, but his cruelty equaled his bravery. No pity could be\nexpected from him. His name was well known to the English soldiers, and\na price had been set upon his head by the governor of New Zealand.

Though the white man is at\nperfect liberty to invade this \"reserved\" territory, yet the black may\ncall it his own. Paganel, who was in his element wherever statistics or history was\nconcerned, went into full details respecting the native races. He gave\na long account of the cruelties to which these unfortunate beings\nhad been subjected at the hands of the early colonists, and showed\nhow little had been done by the interference of the government. As\na striking instance of the manner in which the aborigines melt away\nbefore the advance of civilization, he cited the case of Tasmania,\nwhich at the beginning of this century had five thousand native\ninhabitants, but in 1863 had only seven. [Sidenote: STUDIES IN ANTHROPOLOGY.] \"Fifty years ago,\" said he, \"we should have met in our course many\na tribe of natives; whereas thus far we have not seen even one.

Of these miserable beings there were about thirty, men, women,\nand children, dressed in ragged kangaroo-skins. Their first movement\nwas one of flight; but a few words from Ayrton restored confidence, and\nthey slowly approached the party of Europeans. The major jocularly insisted that Robert was correct in saying that\nhe had seen a monkey; but Lady Helena declined to accept his views,\nand, getting out of the cart, made friendly advances to these degraded\nbeings, who seemed to look upon her as a divinity. Reassured by her\ngentle manner, they surrounded the travelers, and began to cast wishful\nglances at the provisions which the cart contained. Glenarvan, at the\nrequest of his wife, distributed a quantity of food among the hungry\ngroup.

The shipwrecked sailor, prisoner of a native tribe, was\ncarried into the interior regions watered by the Darling. Here he led\na very wretched existence, because the tribe itself was miserable; but\nhe was not maltreated. For two long years he endured a painful slavery. However, the hope of regaining his liberty sustained his courage. He\nwatched for the least opportunity of escaping, although his flight\nwould plunge him into the midst of innumerable perils. One night\nin October he eluded the vigilance of the natives, and took refuge\nin the depths of extensive forests. For a month, living on roots,\nedible ferns, and the gum of the mimosa, often overcome by despair,\nhe wandered in those vast solitudes, with the sun as his guide by\nday and the stars by night. In this way he crossed marshes, rivers,\nmountains, in short, all that uninhabited portion of country that few\ntravelers have explored. At last, exhausted and almost dead, he reached\nthe hospitable dwelling of Mr. O'Moore, where his labor insured him a\ncomfortable livelihood. \"And if Ayrton is pleased with me,\" said the Irish colonist, when the\nstory was finished, \"I cannot but be pleased with him. He is an honest\nand intelligent man, a good worker, and, if he chooses, this house\nshall long be at his service.\" Ayrton thanked Mr. O'Moore, and waited for further questions. He\nprobably thought, however, that the legitimate curiosity of his hearers\nought to be satisfied. What could he say that had not been repeated\na hundred times already? Glenarvan was, therefore, about to open the\nconversation on a new topic, to profit by the information received from\nAyrton, when the major, addressing him, said:\n\n\"You were quartermaster of the Britannia?\" \"Yes,\" replied Ayrton. But perceiving that a certain feeling of distrust, a doubt, however\nslight, had suggested this inquiry, he added,--\n\n\"I saved my contract from the wreck.\" He immediately left the room in search of this authoritative document. During his absence, which lasted but a few moments, Mr. O'Moore said:\n\n\"My lord, I will answer for it that Ayrton is an honest man.

He is a true\nman, and worthy of your entire confidence.\" Glenarvan was about to answer that he had never doubted Ayrton's\nhonesty, when the latter returned and presented his contract. It was a\npaper signed by the owners of the Britannia and Captain Grant, whose\nwriting Mary recognized immediately. It stated that \"Tom Ayrton, able\nseaman, was engaged as quartermaster on board the brig Britannia of\nGlasgow.\" There was, therefore, no possible doubt of Ayrton's identity,\nfor it would have been difficult to suppose that this contract could be\nin his hands and not belong to him.

But\nCaptain Mangles had promised to watch over him, a fact which tended not\na little to allay Miss Grant's apprehension for her brother's safety. Of all the sports of the day the most interesting was unquestionably\na kangaroo hunt. About four o'clock the dogs started a troop of these\ncurious animals. The little ones took refuge in their mothers' pouches,\nand the whole drove rushed away in single file. Nothing can be more\nastonishing than the enormous bounds of the kangaroo, whose hind legs\nare twice as long as its fore ones, and bend like a spring. At the head\nof the drove was a male five feet high,--\"an old man,\" in the language\nof the bushmen. For four or five miles the chase was briskly continued. The kangaroos\ndid not slacken their pace; and the dogs, who feared, with good reason,\nthe powerful blows of their formidable paws, did not venture to\napproach them. But at last the drove stopped in exhaustion, and \"the\nold man\" braced himself against the trunk of a tree, ready to fight\nfor his life. One of the pointers, carried on by the impetus of his\ncourse, rolled within reach of him. A moment after, the unfortunate\ndog was tossed into the air, and fell back lifeless.

The oxen, as they\ncould not work to advantage at sudden turns, had frequently to be\nunyoked, and the cart blocked to prevent it from sliding back. Ayrton\nwas repeatedly forced to bring the already exhausted horses to his\nassistance. Whether this exertion was too prolonged, or whether from some other\ncause, one of the horses gave out during the ascent. He fell suddenly,\nwithout an instant's warning. It was Mulready's horse; and when the\nsailor attempted to help him up, he found that he was dead.

This\ngastrolobium is a useful plant.\" \"Then they were silent,\" added MacNabb, \"and departed. I wanted to know\nmore: I followed them. The conversation soon began again.

Call him Ben Joyce, for he has well earned\nhis name.' These rascals then left the wood of gum-trees. I knew what\nI wished, and returned to the encampment with the certainty that all\nthe convicts in Australia are not reformed, in spite of Paganel's\narguments.\" \"Then,\" said Glenarvan, whose face was pale with anger, \"Ayrton has\nbrought us here to rob and assassinate us?\"", "similarity": 0.4272395372390747}]}

His intentions had been clearly proved,\nand required, on the part of Glenarvan, extreme vigilance. Fortunately,\nthere was less to fear from the detected bandit than the secret traitor. But one serious fact appeared from this explanation. No one had yet\nthought of it; only Mary Grant, disregarding the past, looked forward\nto the future. Captain Mangles first saw her pale and disconsolate. He\nunderstood what was passing in her mind. \"Miss Mary!\" cried he, \"you are weeping!\" \"What is the matter, my child?\" asked Lady Helena. \"My father, madam, my father!\" replied the young girl.

And he had no need to; educated in the schools of Frézier, Molina,\nHumboldt, and Miers, his unerring memory could neither be deceived nor\nbaffled.

Chance alone had led them back to\nthis vessel that they had ceased to regard as theirs, and in what a sad\nstate of exhaustion and feebleness! However, before thinking of fatigue, or the imperative calls of hunger\nand thirst, Glenarvan questioned Tom Austin concerning his presence in\nthese waters. Why was the Duncan on the eastern coast of New Zealand? Why was she not in the hands of Ben Joyce? By what providential working\nhad God restored her to the fugitives? These were the questions that\nwere hurriedly addressed to Tom Austin. The old sailor did not know\nwhich to answer first. He therefore concluded to listen only to Lord\nGlenarvan, and reply to him. \"But the convicts?\" inquired Glenarvan. \"What have you done with the\nconvicts?\" \"The convicts!\" replied Tom Austin, like a man who is at a loss to\nunderstand a question. \"Yes; the wretches who attacked the yacht.\" \"What yacht, my lord? The Duncan?\" \"Of course.

I only conformed to the instructions contained in your\nletter.\" \"My letter?\" exclaimed Glenarvan. The ten travelers at once surrounded Tom Austin, and gazed at him in\neager curiosity. The letter written at the Snowy River had reached the\nDuncan. \"Well,\" continued Glenarvan, \"let us have an explanation; for I almost\nthink I am dreaming. You received a letter, Tom?\" \"Yes; a letter from your lordship.\" \"At Melbourne?\" \"At Melbourne; just as I had finished the repair of the ship.\" \"And this letter?\" \"It was not written by you; but it was signed by you, my lord.\" \"Exactly; it was sent by a convict, Ben Joyce.\" \"No; by the sailor called Ayrton, quartermaster of the Britannia.\" \"Yes, Ayrton or Ben Joyce; it is the same person.

Australia!\" replied Glenarvan's companions, with one\nvoice. [Illustration: As soon as they set foot on deck the bagpiper struck up\na well remembered air, while hearty hurrahs welcomed the owner's return\non board.] Austin was now bewildered.

As soon as he arrived at the bay, he was to\nsend a detachment of sailors under the command of Ayrton. He had just reached this part of his letter, when the major, who had\nbeen looking over his shoulder, asked him, in a singular tone, how he\nwrote the word Ayrton. \"As it is pronounced,\" replied Glenarvan. \"That is a mistake,\" said the major coolly. \"It is pronounced Ayrton,\nbut it is written 'Ben Joyce'!\" CHAPTER XLI. THE PLOT UNVEILED. The sound of the name of Ben Joyce fell upon the party like a\nthunderbolt. Ayrton suddenly sprang to his feet. In his hand was a\nrevolver. A report was heard; and Glenarvan fell, struck by a bullet. Before Captain Mangles and the sailors recovered from the surprise into\nwhich this unexpected turn of affairs had thrown them, the audacious\nconvict had escaped, and joined his band, scattered along the edge of\nthe wood of gum-trees. [Illustration: A report was heard; and Glenarvan fell, struck by a\nbullet.] The tent did not offer a sufficient shelter against the bullets, and\nit was clearly necessary to beat a retreat. Glenarvan, who was but\nslightly injured, had risen. \"To the cart! to the cart!\" cried Captain Mangles, as he hurried on\nLady Helena and Mary Grant, who were soon in safety behind its stout\nsides. The captain, the major, Paganel, and the sailors then seized their\nrifles, and stood ready to repel the convicts. Glenarvan and Robert had\njoined the ladies, while Olbinett hastened to the common defence. These events had transpired with the rapidity of lightning. Captain\nMangles attentively watched the edge of the wood; but the reports\nsuddenly ceased on the arrival of Ben Joyce, and a profound silence\nsucceeded the noisy fusillade. A few wreaths of white smoke were still\ncurling up between the branches of the gum-trees, but the tall tufts of\ngastrolobium were motionless and all signs of attack had disappeared. The major and Captain Mangles extended their examinations as far as the\ngreat trees. The place was abandoned. Numerous footprints were seen,\nand a few half-burnt cartridges smoked on the ground. The major, like\na prudent man, extinguished them, for a spark was enough to kindle a\nformidable conflagration in this forest of dry trees. \"The convicts have disappeared,\" said Captain Mangles. \"Yes,\" replied the major; \"and this disappearance alarms me. I should\nprefer to meet them face to face. It is better to encounter a tiger in\nthe open plain than a serpent in the grass. Let us search these bushes\naround the cart.\" [Sidenote: UNRAVELINGS.] The major and captain scoured the surrounding country. But from the\nedge of the wood to the banks of the Snowy they did not meet with a\nsingle convict. Ben Joyce's band seemed to have flown away, like a\nflock of mischievous birds. This disappearance was too strange to\ninspire a perfect security. They therefore resolved to keep on the\nwatch. The cart, which was a really immovable fortress, became the\ncentre of the encampment, and two men kept guard, relieving each other\nevery hour.

Of what use can\nhe be?\" \"To give us the information we need for our journey,\" replied\nGlenarvan. \"Let us go in.\" Glenarvan, followed by Ayrton, entered the tavern. The landlord of\n\"Bush Inn\" was a coarse man, of forbidding appearance, who had to\nconsider himself as the principal customer for the gin, brandy, and\nwhisky of his tavern, and scarcely ever saw any one but squatters or\nherdsmen. He replied in an ill-humored way to the questions that were addressed\nhim; but his answers sufficed to determine Ayrton upon his course. Glenarvan, however, remunerated the tavern-keeper for the little\ntrouble they had given him, and was about to leave the inn, when a\nplacard, affixed to the wall, attracted his attention. It was a notice\nof the colonial police, detailing the escape of the convicts from\nPerth, and setting a price upon the head of Ben Joyce--a hundred pounds\nsterling to any one who should deliver him up. \"Indeed,\" said Glenarvan, \"that is a rascal worth hanging.\" \"And especially worth taking,\" replied Ayrton. \"A hundred pounds! What\na sum! He is not worth it.\" \"As for the inn-keeper,\" added Glenarvan, as he left the room, \"I\nscarcely put faith in him, despite his placard.\" \"Nor I either,\" said Ayrton. Glenarvan and the quartermaster rejoined the party, and they all\nproceeded to where a narrow pass wound across the chain. Here they\nbegan the ascent. [Sidenote: ANOTHER DEATH.] But it was an arduous task. More than once the ladies and their\ncompanions had to dismount, and it was often necessary to push the\nwheels of the heavy vehicle at some steep ascent, or to hold it\nback along the edge of some dangerous precipice. The oxen, as they\ncould not work to advantage at sudden turns, had frequently to be\nunyoked, and the cart blocked to prevent it from sliding back. Ayrton\nwas repeatedly forced to bring the already exhausted horses to his\nassistance. Whether this exertion was too prolonged, or whether from some other\ncause, one of the horses gave out during the ascent. He fell suddenly,\nwithout an instant's warning. It was Mulready's horse; and when the\nsailor attempted to help him up, he found that he was dead. Ayrton\nexamined the animal carefully, but did not seem to understand the cause\nof this sudden death. \"The beast must have burst a blood-vessel,\" said Glenarvan. \"Evidently,\" replied Ayrton. \"Take my horse, Mulready,\" added Glenarvan; \"I will join Lady Helena in\nthe cart.\" Mulready obeyed, and the little party continued their fatiguing ascent,\nabandoning the body to the crows. The next day they began the descent, which was much more rapid. During\nits course a violent hail-storm burst on them, and they were forced to\nseek a shelter beneath the rocks. Not hailstones, but pieces of ice as\nlarge as one's hand, were precipitated from the angry clouds. A sling\ncould not have hurled them with greater force, and several sharp blows\nwarned Paganel and Robert to be on their guard. The cart was pierced\nthrough in many places: indeed, few roofs could have resisted the fall\nof these cutting missiles, some of which froze to the trunks of the\ntrees.", "similarity": 0.44287267327308655}]}

[Sidenote: CHIEFS, CIVILIZED AND UNCIVILIZED.] His companions were worthy of him; they shared his noble thoughts, and\ntheir calm and haughty appearance would scarcely have intimated that\nthey were being carried away to captivity and suffering. By common\nconsent, at Glenarvan's suggestion, they had resolved to feign a proud\nindifference in the presence of the savages. It was the only way of\ninfluencing those fierce natures. [Illustration: A boat might have been seen ascending the Waikato. It\nwas a canoe seventy feet long and five broad.] Since leaving the encampment, the natives, taciturn like all savages,\nhad scarcely spoken to each other. However, from a few words exchanged,\nGlenarvan perceived that they were acquainted with the English\nlanguage. He therefore resolved to question the chief in regard to the\nfate that was in store for them. Addressing Kai-Koumou, he said, in a\nfearless tone:\n\n\"Where are you taking us, chief?\" Kai-Koumou gazed at him coldly without answering. \"Say, what do you expect to do with us?\" continued Glenarvan. The chief's eyes blazed with a sudden light, and in a stern voice he\nreplied:\n\n\"To exchange you, if your friends will ransom you; to kill you, if they\nrefuse.\" Glenarvan asked no more, but hope returned to his heart. Doubtless,\nsome chiefs of the Maori tribe had fallen into the hands of the\nEnglish, and the natives would attempt to recover them by way of\nexchange; their situation, therefore, was not one for despair. Meantime the canoe rapidly ascended the river. Paganel, whose\nchangeable disposition carried him from one extreme to another, had\nregained his hopefulness. He believed that the Maoris were sparing them\nthe fatigue of their journey to the English settlements, and that they\nwere certain to arrive at their destination. He was, therefore, quite\nresigned to his lot, and traced on his map the course of the Waikato\nacross the plains and valleys of the province. Lady Helena and Mary\nGrant, suppressing their terror, conversed in low tones with Glenarvan,\nand the most skillful physiognomist could not have detected on their\nfaces the anxiety of their hearts. The Waikato River is worshiped by the natives, as Paganel knew, and\nEnglish and German naturalists have never ascended beyond its junction\nwith the Waipa. Whither did Kai-Koumou intend to take his captives? The geographer could not have guessed if the word \"Taupo,\" frequently\nrepeated, had not attracted his attention. By consulting his map,\nhe saw that this name was applied to a celebrated lake in the most\nmountainous part of the island, and that from it the Waikato flows. Paganel, addressing Captain Mangles in French, so as not to be\nunderstood by the savages, asked him how fast the canoe was going. The\ncaptain thought about three miles an hour.", "similarity": 0.3883429765701294}, {"chunk_id": 206, "text": "But on the third day the huts were opened. The savages, men, women,\nand children, to the number of several hundreds, assembled in the pah,\nsilent and calm. Kai-Koumou came out of his house, and, surrounded by\nthe principal warriors of his tribe, took his place on a mound several\nfeet high in the centre of the fortification. The crowd of natives\nformed a semicircle around him, and the whole assembly preserved\nabsolute silence. At a sign from the chief, a warrior advanced towards the temple. \"Remember!\" said Lady Helena to her husband. Glenarvan clasped his wife to his heart. At this moment Mary Grant\napproached John Mangles. \"Lord and Lady Glenarvan,\" said she, \"I think that, if a wife can die\nby the hand of her husband to escape a degrading existence, a maiden\ncan likewise die by the hand of her lover. John (for I may tell you\nat this critical moment), have I not long been your betrothed in the\ndepths of your heart? May I rely upon you, dear John, as Lady Helena\ndoes upon Lord Glenarvan?\" \"Mary!\" cried the young captain, in terror. \"Ah! dear Mary----\"\n\nHe could not finish: the mat was raised, and the captives were dragged\ntowards Kai-Koumou. The two women were resigned to their fate, while\nthe men concealed their anguish beneath a calmness that showed\nsuperhuman self-control. They came before the chief, who did not delay\nsentence. \"You killed Kara-Tété!\" said he to Glenarvan. \"I did.\" [Sidenote: THE BEGINNING OF THE END.] \"You shall die to-morrow at sunrise.\" \"Alone?\" inquired Glenarvan, whose heart beat quickly. \"What! as if our Tohonga's life were not more precious than yours!\" cried Kai-Koumou, whose eyes expressed a fierce regret. At this moment a commotion took place among the natives. Glenarvan cast\na rapid glance around him. The crowd opened, and a warrior, dripping\nwith sweat and overcome with fatigue, appeared. As soon as Kai-Koumou perceived him, he said in English, evidently that\nhe might be understood by the captives:\n\n\"You come from the camp of the pale-faces?\" \"Yes,\" replied the Maori. \"You saw the prisoner, our Tohonga?\" \"I did.\" \"Is he living?\" \"He is dead! The English have shot him.\" The fate of Glenarvan and his companions was settled. \"You shall all die to-morrow at daybreak!\" cried Kai-Koumou. The unfortunates were therefore to suffer a common death. Lady Helena\nand Mary Grant raised towards heaven a look of thankfulness. The captives were not taken back to the temple. They were to attend\nthat day the funeral of the dead chief, and the bloody ceremonies\nconnected therewith. A party of natives conducted them to the foot of\nan enormous koudi, where these guardians remained without losing sight\nof their prisoners. The rest of the tribe, absorbed in their official\nmourning, seemed to have forgotten them. The customary three days had elapsed since the death of Kara-Tété. The\nsoul of the deceased had therefore forever abandoned its mortal abode. The sacred rites began. The body was carried to a small mound in the centre of the\nfortification, clothed in splendid costume, and enveloped in a\nmagnificent flaxen mat. The head was adorned with plumes, and wore a\ncrown of green leaves. The face, arms, and breast had been rubbed with\noil, and therefore showed no mortification. The parents and friends of the deceased came to the foot of the\nmound, and all at once, as if some director were beating time to a\nfuneral dirge, a great concert of cries, groans, and sobs arose on the\nair.

Six unfortunates were brought before the corpse of their master and\nmistress. They were servants, whom the pitiless laws of war had reduced\nto slavery. During the life of the chief they had undergone the\nseverest privations, suffered a thousand abuses, had been scantily fed,\nand compelled constantly to labor like beasts; and now, according to\nthe Maori belief, they were to continue their existence of servitude\nfor eternity.

Moreover, this\ndeath was rapid, protracted sufferings were spared them. These were\nreserved for the captives who stood trembling not twenty paces distant. Six blows of the méré, given by six stalwart warriors, stretched the\nvictims on the ground in a pool of blood. It was the signal for a\nterrible scene of cannibalism, which followed in all its horrible\ndetails.

The chief, whose name was \"Hihy\" (sunbeam), was not a bad man. The\nspectacles and telescope gave him a high opinion of Paganel, whom he\nattached carefully to his person, not only by his benefits, but by\nstrong flaxen ropes, especially at night. This novel situation lasted three long days. Was he well or badly\ntreated? Both, as he stated without further explanation. In short, he\nwas a prisoner, and, except for the prospect of immediate torture,\nhis condition did not seem more enviable than that of his unfortunate\nfriends. Fortunately, last night he succeeded in biting asunder his ropes and\nescaping. He had witnessed at a distance the burial of the chief,\nknew that he had been interred on the summit of Maunganamu mountain,\nand that it was tabooed in consequence. He therefore resolved to take\nrefuge there, not wishing to leave the place where his companions were\nheld captives. He succeeded in his undertaking, arrived at Kara-Tété's\ntomb, and waited in hope that Providence would in some way deliver his\nfriends. Such was Paganel's story. Did he omit designedly any circumstance\nof his stay among the natives? More than once his embarrassment led\nthem to suspect so. However that might be, he received unanimous\ncongratulations; and as the past was now known, they returned to the\npresent. Their situation was still exceedingly critical. The natives, if they\ndid not venture to climb the mountain, expected that hunger and thirst\nwould force their prisoners to surrender. It was only a matter of time,\nand the savages had great patience. Glenarvan did not disregard the\ndifficulties of his position, but waited for the favorable issue which\nProvidence seemed to promise. And first he wished to examine this improvised fortress; not to defend\nit, for an attack was not to be feared, but that he might find a way of\nescaping. The major and the captain, Robert, Paganel, and himself, took\nthe exact bearings of the mountain. They observed the direction of the\npaths, their branches and declivities. A ridge a mile in length united\nthe Maunganamu to the Wahiti range, and then declined to the plain. Its\nnarrow and winding summit presented the only practicable route, in case\nescape should become possible. If the fugitives could pass this point\nunperceived, under cover of the night, perhaps they might succeed in\nreaching the deep valleys and outwitting the Maoris. But this course offered more than one danger, as they would have to\npass below within gun-shot. The bullets of the natives on the lower\nramparts of the pah might intercept them, and form a barrier that no\none could safely cross. Glenarvan and his friends, as soon as they ventured on the dangerous\npart of the ridge, were saluted with a volley of shots; but only a\nfew wads, borne by the wind, reached them. They were made of printed\npaper. Paganel picked them up out of curiosity, but it was difficult to\ndecipher them. [Sidenote: A STRANGE COLPORTEUR.] \"Why!\" said he, \"do you know, my friends, what these creatures use for\nwads in their guns?\" \"No,\" replied Glenarvan. \"Leaves of the Bible! If this is the use they make of the sacred\nwritings, I pity the missionaries.

Each cast a longing glance towards the surrounding mountains, the deep\nvalleys, still veiled in mist, and the surface of Lake Taupo, gently\nrippling beneath the morning wind. Then all, eager to know Paganel's\nnew project, gathered around him with questioning looks; while the\ngeographer at once satisfied the restless curiosity of his companions. \"My friends,\" said he, \"my project has this advantage, that if it does\nnot produce the result that I expect, or even fails, our situation will\nnot be impaired. But it ought to and will succeed.\" \"And this project?\" asked the major. \"This is it,\" replied Paganel. \"The superstition of the natives has\nmade this mountain a place of refuge, and this superstition must help\nus to escape. If I succeed in convincing Kai-Koumou that we have become\nthe victims of our sacrilege, that the wrath of Heaven has fallen upon\nus, in short, that we have met a terrible death, do you think that he\nwill abandon the mountain and return to his village?\" \"Probably,\" said Glenarvan. \"And with what horrible death do you threaten us?\" inquired Lady Helena. \"The death of the sacrilegious, my friends,\" continued Paganel. \"The\navenging flames are under our feet. Let us open a way for them.\" \"What! you would make a volcano?\" cried Captain Mangles. \"Yes, a factitious, an improvised one, whose fury we will control. There is quite a supply of vapors and subterranean fires that only\nask for an outlet. Let us arrange an artificial eruption for our own\nadvantage.\" \"The idea is good,\" said the major, \"and well conceived, Paganel.\" \"You understand,\" resumed the geographer, \"that we are to feign being\nconsumed by the flames of Pluto, and shall disappear spiritually in the\ntomb of Kara-Tété.\" [Sidenote: A VOLCANO IN MINIATURE.] \"Where we shall remain three, four, or five days, if necessary, till\nthe savages are convinced of our death, and abandon the siege.\" \"But if they think of making sure of our destruction,\" said Miss Grant,\n\"and climb the mountain?\" \"No, my dear Mary,\" replied Paganel, \"they will not do that.

This man was a native, of tall form, about forty-five years old, with\nbroad breast and powerful limbs. His protruding and deeply furrowed\nbrow, his fierce look and his sinister countenance, showed him to be a\nformidable individual. He was a Maori chief of high rank, as could be seen by the delicate\nand compact tattooing that striped his face and body. Two black\nspirals, starting from the nostrils of his aquiline nose, circled his\ntawny eyes, met on his forehead, and were lost in his abundant hair. His mouth, with its shining teeth, and his chin, were hidden beneath\na net-work of varied colors, while graceful lines wound down to his\nsinewy breast. There was no doubt as to his rank. The sharp albatross bone, used\nby Maori tattooers, had furrowed his face five times, in close and\ndeep lines. That he had reached his fifth promotion was evident from\nhis haughty bearing. A large flaxen mat, ornamented with dog-skins,\nenveloped his person; while a girdle, bloody with his recent conflicts,\nencircled his waist. From his ears dangled ear-rings of green jade, and\naround his neck hung necklaces of \"pounamous,\" sacred stones to which\nthe New Zealanders attribute miraculous properties.

No pity could be\nexpected from him. His name was well known to the English soldiers, and\na price had been set upon his head by the governor of New Zealand.

Here they were introduced\nto Madame Ipharaguerre, who appeared to be \"a good-looking person,\" if\nthis expression may be employed in regard to an Indian. When he had exhausted himself, the sergeant asked his guests to what he\nowed the honor of their visit. And now it was their turn to explain.

Indeed,\nhe either did not know, or had forgotten, that a civil war, which\nwas afterwards to involve Brazil, was decimating two-thirds of the\nrepublic. The Indians had everything to gain in these internal\nstruggles, and could not neglect such fine opportunities for plunder. The sergeant, therefore, was not mistaken in attributing this desertion\nof the Pampas to the civil war that was being waged in the northern\npart of the Argentine Provinces.

The distance gave a fantastic appearance to the\nundulating movements of the long, sinuous column. The tribe stopped at the summit of the mountain, which was eight\nhundred feet high, at the place prepared for Kara-Tété's interment.

The major, like a perfect horseman,\nadmired unreservedly this specimen of the horses of the plains. This\nbeautiful creature was called Thaouka, which means \"bird\" in the\nPatagonian language, and he justly merited this appellation. [Sidenote: A FRESH START.] When Thalcave was in the saddle, the horse pranced with spirited grace,\nand the Patagonian, a skillful rider, was magnificent to behold. His\noutfit comprised two weapons of the chase, the \"bolas\" and the lasso. The bolas consists of three balls tied together by a leathern string,\nwhich are fastened to the front of the saddle. The Indians frequently\nthrow them the distance of a hundred paces at the animal or enemy that\nthey are pursuing, and with such precision that they twist about their\nlegs and bring them to the ground. It is, therefore, in their hands a\nformidable instrument, and they handle it with surprising dexterity. The lasso, on the contrary, does not leave the hand that wields it. It\nconsists simply of a leathern thong thirty feet in length, terminating\nin a slip-noose which works upon an iron ring. The right hand throws\nthe slip-noose, while the left hand holds the remainder of the lasso,\nthe end of which is firmly tied to the saddle. A long carbine in a\nsling completed the Patagonian's armament. Thalcave, without observing the admiration caused by his natural\ngrace, ease and courage, took the lead, and the party advanced, now\nat a gallop, and now at a walk, for their horses seemed entirely\nunaccustomed to trotting. Robert mounted with much boldness, and\nspeedily convinced Glenarvan of his ability to keep his seat. On issuing from the gorges of the Andes, they encountered a great\nnumber of sand-ridges, called \"medanos,\" real waves incessantly\nagitated by the wind, when the roots of the herbage did not confine\nthem to the earth. This sand is of an extreme fineness; and, at the\nleast breath, they saw it float away in light clouds, or form regular\nsand-columns which rose to a considerable height. This spectacle caused\npleasure as well as annoyance to the eyes. Pleasure, for nothing was\nmore curious than these columns, wandering over the plain, struggling,\nmingling, sinking and rising in inexpressible confusion; and annoyance,\nsince an impalpable dust emanated from these innumerable medanos and\npenetrated the eyelids, however tightly they were closed.

Yet, looking at his calm and\npassionless countenance, you could not have divined the depth of his\nanguish, for in his present critical situation he did not betray the\nextent of his misfortunes. He felt that he ought to set an example of\nfortitude to his wife and his companions, as being the husband and\nchief. Moreover, he was ready to die first for the common safety, if\ncircumstances should require it. [Sidenote: CHIEFS, CIVILIZED AND UNCIVILIZED.] His companions were worthy of him; they shared his noble thoughts, and\ntheir calm and haughty appearance would scarcely have intimated that\nthey were being carried away to captivity and suffering. By common\nconsent, at Glenarvan's suggestion, they had resolved to feign a proud\nindifference in the presence of the savages. It was the only way of\ninfluencing those fierce natures. [Illustration: A boat might have been seen ascending the Waikato. It\nwas a canoe seventy feet long and five broad.] Since leaving the encampment, the natives, taciturn like all savages,\nhad scarcely spoken to each other. However, from a few words exchanged,\nGlenarvan perceived that they were acquainted with the English\nlanguage. He therefore resolved to question the chief in regard to the\nfate that was in store for them. Addressing Kai-Koumou, he said, in a\nfearless tone:\n\n\"Where are you taking us, chief?\" Kai-Koumou gazed at him coldly without answering. \"Say, what do you expect to do with us?\" continued Glenarvan. The chief's eyes blazed with a sudden light, and in a stern voice he\nreplied:\n\n\"To exchange you, if your friends will ransom you; to kill you, if they\nrefuse.\" Glenarvan asked no more, but hope returned to his heart. Doubtless,\nsome chiefs of the Maori tribe had fallen into the hands of the\nEnglish, and the natives would attempt to recover them by way of\nexchange; their situation, therefore, was not one for despair. Meantime the canoe rapidly ascended the river. Paganel, whose\nchangeable disposition carried him from one extreme to another, had\nregained his hopefulness. He believed that the Maoris were sparing them\nthe fatigue of their journey to the English settlements, and that they\nwere certain to arrive at their destination. He was, therefore, quite\nresigned to his lot, and traced on his map the course of the Waikato\nacross the plains and valleys of the province. Lady Helena and Mary\nGrant, suppressing their terror, conversed in low tones with Glenarvan,\nand the most skillful physiognomist could not have detected on their\nfaces the anxiety of their hearts. The Waikato River is worshiped by the natives, as Paganel knew, and\nEnglish and German naturalists have never ascended beyond its junction\nwith the Waipa. Whither did Kai-Koumou intend to take his captives? The geographer could not have guessed if the word \"Taupo,\" frequently\nrepeated, had not attracted his attention. By consulting his map,\nhe saw that this name was applied to a celebrated lake in the most\nmountainous part of the island, and that from it the Waikato flows.

The bodies of Kara-Tété and his wife were taken up, and their limbs\nbent and gathered against the stomach, according to the New Zealand\ncustom. The place for the tomb had been chosen outside of the\nfortification, about two miles distant, on the summit of a small\nmountain, called Maunganamu, situated on the right shore of the lake. Thither the bodies were to be carried. Two very rude palanquins, or\nrather litters, were brought to the foot of the mound.

Kai-Koumou, according to a custom quite ordinary in New Zealand, joined\nthe rank of priest to that of chief, and could, therefore, extend to\npersons or objects the superstitious protection of the taboo. The taboo, which is common to the tribes of Polynesia, has the power\nto prohibit at once all connection with the object or person tabooed. According to the Maori religion, whoever should lay his sacrilegious\nhand on what is declared taboo would be punished with death by the\noffended god; and in case the divinity should delay to avenge his own\ninsult, the priests would not fail to excite his anger. As for the prisoners confined in the temple, the taboo had rescued\nthem from the fury of the tribe. Some of the natives, the friends and\npartisans of Kai-Koumou, had stopped suddenly at the command of their\nchief, and had protected the captives. [Sidenote: THE TORTURES OF SUSPENSE.] Glenarvan, however, was not blind to the fate that was reserved for\nhim. Only his death could atone for the murder of a chief. Among savage\nraces death is always preceded by a protracted torture. He therefore\nexpected to cruelly expiate the righteous indignation that had nerved\nhis arm, but hoped that Kai-Koumou's rage would fall only on himself. What a night he and his companions passed! Who could depict their\nanguish, or measure their sufferings? Neither poor Robert nor brave\nPaganel had reappeared. But how could they doubt their fate? Were they\nnot the first victims of the natives' vengeance? All hope had vanished\neven from the heart of the major, who did not easily despair. John\nMangles felt himself growing mad at sight of the sad dejection of Mary\nGrant, thus separated from her brother. Glenarvan thought of that\nterrible request of Lady Helena, who, rather than yield to torture or\nslavery, preferred to die by his hand. Could he summon this fearful\ncourage? As for an escape, that was plainly impossible. Ten warriors,\narmed to the teeth, guarded the entrance of the temple. Morning came at last. There had been no communication between the\nnatives and the prisoners. The hut contained a considerable quantity\nof food, which the unfortunates scarcely touched. Hunger gave place to\ngrief. The day passed without bringing a change or a hope. Doubtless\nthe hour for the dead chief's funeral and their torture would be the\nsame. However, although Glenarvan concluded that Kai-Koumou must have\nabandoned all idea of exchange, the major on this point retained a\ngleam of hope. \"Who knows,\" said he, reminding Glenarvan of the effect produced upon\nthe chief by the death of Kara-Tété,--\"who knows but that Kai-Koumou in\nreality feels obliged to you?\" But, in spite of these observations, Glenarvan would no longer hope. The next day also passed away without the preparations for torture\nbeing made. The reason of the delay was this. The Maoris believe that the soul, for three days after death, inhabits\nthe body of the deceased, and therefore during this time the corpse\nremains unburied. This custom was rigorously observed, and for two days\nthe pah was deserted. Captain Mangles frequently stood on Wilson's\nshoulders and surveyed the fortification. No native was seen; only the\nsentinels guarded in turn at the door of their prison. But on the third day the huts were opened.

The waters of the surrounding country have rushed down and\nfilled this enormous cavity, and the abyss has become a lake, whose\ndepth no one has yet been able to measure. Such is this strange Lake Taupo, elevated eleven hundred and fifty\nfeet above the level of the sea, and surrounded by lofty mountains. On\nthe west of the prisoners towered precipitous rocks of imposing form;\non the north rose several distant ridges, crowned with small forests;\non the east spread a broad plain furrowed by a trail and covered with\npumice-stones that glittered beneath a net-work of bushes; and on\nthe north, behind a stretch of woodland, volcanic peaks majestically\nencircled this vast extent of water, the fury of whose tempests equaled\nthat of the ocean cyclones. But Paganel was scarcely disposed to enlarge his account of these\nwonders, nor were his friends in a mood to listen. They gazed in\nsilence towards the northeast shore of the lake, whither the canoe was\nbringing them. The mission established at Pukawa, on the western shores, no longer\nexisted. The missionary had been driven by the war far from the\nprincipal dwellings of the insurrectionists. The prisoners were\nhelpless, abandoned to the mercy of the vengeful Maoris, and in that\nwild part of the island to which Christianity has never penetrated. Kai-Koumou, leaving the waters of the Waikato, passed through the\nlittle creek which served as an outlet to the river, doubled a sharp\npromontory, and landed on the eastern border of the lake, at the base\nof the first slopes of Mount Manga. A quarter of a mile distant, on a buttress of the mountain, appeared\na \"pah,\" a Maori fortification, situated in an impregnable position.

Meantime the boughs shriveled, crackled, and twisted in the fire like\nburning serpents. The glowing fragments fell into the rushing waters\nand floated away in the current, sending forth flashes of ruddy light. The flames at one moment would rise to a fearful height, to be lost\nin the aerial conflagration, and the next, beaten back by the furious\nhurricane, would envelop the tree like a robe of molten gold. Glenarvan, Robert, the major, Paganel, and the sailors, were terrified. A thick smoke was stifling them; an intolerable heat was scorching\nthem. The fire was extending to the lower part of the tree on their\nside; nothing could stop or extinguish it; and they felt themselves\nirrevocably doomed to the torture of those victims who are confined\nwithin the burning sides of a sacrificial fire-basket. At last their situation was no longer tenable, and of two deaths they\nwere forced to choose the least cruel. \"To the water!\" cried Glenarvan. [Illustration: In a few moments the gigantic water-spout struck the\nombu, and enveloped it in its watery folds.] Wilson, whom the flames had reached, had already plunged into the\ncurrent, when they heard him cry, in tones of the greatest terror,--\n\n\"Help! help!\" Austin rushed towards him and assisted him to regain the trunk. \"What is the matter?\" \"Caymans! caymans!\" replied Wilson. And, in truth, the foot of the\ntree was seen to be surrounded by the most formidable monsters. Their scales glittered in broad plates of light, sharply defined\nby the conflagration. Their flat tails, their pointed heads, their\nprotruding eyes, their jaws, extending back of their ears, all these\ncharacteristic signs were unmistakable. Paganel recognized the\nvoracious alligators peculiar to America, and called caymans in Spanish\ncountries. There were a dozen of them, beating the water with their\npowerful tails, and attacking the tree with their terrible teeth. At this sight the unfortunate travelers felt themselves lost indeed. A\nhorrible death was in store for them,--to perish either by the flames\nor by the teeth of the alligators. There are circumstances in which\nman is powerless to struggle, and where a raging element can only be\nrepulsed by another equally strong. Glenarvan, with a wild look, gazed\nat the fire and water leagued against him, not knowing what aid to\nimplore of Heaven. The storm had now begun to abate; but it had developed in the air a\ngreat quantity of vapor, which the electric phenomena were about to\nset in violent commotion. To the south an enormous water-spout was\ngradually forming,--an inverted cone of mist, uniting the raging waters\nbelow to the stormy clouds above. It advanced revolving with frightful\nrapidity, collected at its centre a liquid column, and by a powerful\nattraction, caused by its gyratory motion, drew towards it all the\nsurrounding currents of air.

There was a cry of admiration at sight of the\neucalyptuses, two hundred feet high, whose spongy bark was five inches\nin thickness. The trunks measured twenty feet in circumference, and\nwere furrowed by streams of odorous sap. Not a branch, not a twig, not\na wanton shoot, not even a knot, disfigured their perfect symmetry. They could not have issued smoother from the hand of the turner. They\nwere like so many columns exactly mated, and could be counted by\nhundreds, spreading at a vast height into capitals of finely-shaped\nbranches adorned with vertical leaves, from which hung solitary\nflowers, whose calices were like inverted urns. Under this evergreen canopy the air circulated freely. A continual\nventilation absorbed the moisture of the earth, and horses, herds of\ncattle, and carts could easily pass between these trees, which were\nwidely separated and arranged in straight rows. It was neither a\nwood with thickets crowded and obstructed by brambles, nor a virgin\nforest barricaded with fallen trunks and entangled with inextricable\nparasites, where only axe and fire can clear a way for the pioneers. A carpet of herbage below, and a sheet of verdure above; long vistas\nof noble pillars; little shade or coolness; a peculiar light, like\nthe rays that sift through a delicate tissue; shadows sharply defined\nupon the ground: all this constituted a strange sight. The forests of\nOceanica are entirely different from those of the New World, and the\neucalyptus--the \"tara\" of the aborigines--is the most perfect tree of\nthe Australian flora. The shade is not dense, nor the darkness profound, beneath these domes\nof verdure, owing to a strange peculiarity in the arrangement of the\nleaves of the eucalyptus. Not one presents its face to the sun, but\nonly its sharp edge. The eye sees nothing but profiles in this singular\nfoliage. Thus the rays of the sun glide to the earth as if they had\npassed between the slats of a window-blind. Every one observed this and seemed surprised. Why this particular\narrangement? This question was naturally addressed to Paganel, who\nreplied like a man who is never at fault. \"What astonishes me,\" said he, \"is not the freak of nature, for she\nknows what she does; but botanists do not always know what they say. Nature was not mistaken in giving to these trees this singular foliage;\nbut men are wrong in calling them eucalyptuses.\" \"What does the word mean?\" asked Mary Grant. \"It comes from the Greek words [Greek: eu kalyptô], signifying _I cover\nwell_. But you all see that the eucalyptus covers badly.\" [Sidenote: A SILENT MARCH.] \"Just so, my dear Paganel,\" replied Glenarvan; \"and now tell us why the\nleaves grow thus.\" \"In this country, where the air is dry,\" said Paganel, \"where rains\nare rare and the soil is parched, the trees need neither wind nor\nsun. Hence these narrow leaves seek to defend themselves against the\nelements and preserve themselves from too great an evaporation. They\ntherefore present their edges, and not their faces, to the action of\nthe solar rays. There is nothing more intelligent than a leaf.\" \"Nor more selfish,\" remarked the major. \"They thought only of\nthemselves, and not at all of travelers.\" The entire party was inclined to be of MacNabb's opinion, except\nPaganel, who, as he wiped his face, congratulated himself upon\ntraveling beneath these shadowless trees.", "similarity": 0.4446101784706116}, {"chunk_id": 202, "text": "This structure was\nbuilt of stakes, interlaced with branches, and lined inside with flax\nmatting.

Several rush screens and some\nmattresses, covered with woven matting of long leaves and twigs,\nserved as beds. In the middle of the room a hole in a stone formed the\nfireplace, and another in the roof answered for a chimney. The smoke, when it became sufficiently thick, perforce escaped at this\noutlet, but it of course blackened the walls of the house. On one side of the hut were storehouses, containing the chief's\nprovisions, his harvest of flax, potatoes, and edible ferns, and\nthe ovens where the various articles of food were cooked by contact\nwith heated stones. Farther off, in small pens, pigs and goats were\nconfined, and dogs ran about seeking their scanty sustenance. They were\nrather poorly kept, for animals that formed the Maori daily food. Glenarvan and his companions had taken in the whole at a glance. They\nawaited beside an empty hut the good pleasure of the chief, exposed to\nthe insults of a crowd of old women, who surrounded them like harpies,\nand threatened them with their fists, crying and howling. Several\nEnglish words that passed their lips clearly indicated that they were\ndemanding immediate vengeance. In the midst of these cries and threats, Lady Helena affected a\ncalmness that she could not feel in her heart. This courageous woman,\nin order that her husband's coolness might not forsake him, heroically\ncontrolled her emotions. Poor Mary Grant felt herself growing weak, and\nCaptain Mangles supported her, ready to die in her defence. The others\nendured this torrent of invectives in various ways, either indifferent\nlike the major, or increasingly annoyed like Paganel.

He allowed this bloody orgy an hour to reach its utmost\nintensity. The last act of the funeral was played with the usual rites. The bodies of Kara-Tété and his wife were taken up, and their limbs\nbent and gathered against the stomach, according to the New Zealand\ncustom. The place for the tomb had been chosen outside of the\nfortification, about two miles distant, on the summit of a small\nmountain, called Maunganamu, situated on the right shore of the lake. Thither the bodies were to be carried. Two very rude palanquins, or\nrather litters, were brought to the foot of the mound. The corpses,\nfolded together, in a sitting posture, and tied in their clothes by a\ngirdle of withes, were placed on this primitive bier. Four warriors\nbore it between them, and the entire tribe, chanting the funeral hymn,\nfollowed them in procession to the place of burial. The captives, who were always watched, saw them leave the inner\ninclosure of the pah, and then the songs and cries gradually died away. For about half an hour this funeral escort continued in sight, in the\ndepths of the valley. Finally they perceived it again winding along\nthe mountain paths. The distance gave a fantastic appearance to the\nundulating movements of the long, sinuous column. The tribe stopped at the summit of the mountain, which was eight\nhundred feet high, at the place prepared for Kara-Tété's interment. A common Maori would have had only a hole and a heap of stones for a\ngrave; but for a powerful and dreaded chief, destined doubtless for a\nspeedy deification, a tomb worthy of his exploits was reserved. [Sidenote: THE LAST NIGHT.] The sepulchre had been surrounded by palisades, while stakes,\nornamented with faces reddened with ochre, stood beside the grave\nwhere the bodies were to lie. The relatives had not forgotten that the\n\"waidoua\" (the spirit of the dead) feeds on substantial nourishment\nlike the body during this perishable life.

Just as the sun was disappearing behind Lake Taupo, the captives were\nled back to their prison. They were not to leave it again until the\nsummit of the Wahiti mountains should kindle with the first beams of\nthe day. One night remained to prepare for death. In spite of the\nfaintness, in spite of the horror with which they were seized, they\nshared their repast in common. \"We shall need all the strength possible to face death,\" said\nGlenarvan. \"We must show these barbarians how Europeans and Christians\ncan die.\"", "similarity": 0.4475710988044739}, {"chunk_id": 54, "text": "His brown color indicated a sound,\nspirited and courageous beast.

The major, like a perfect horseman,\nadmired unreservedly this specimen of the horses of the plains. This\nbeautiful creature was called Thaouka, which means \"bird\" in the\nPatagonian language, and he justly merited this appellation. [Sidenote: A FRESH START.] When Thalcave was in the saddle, the horse pranced with spirited grace,\nand the Patagonian, a skillful rider, was magnificent to behold. His\noutfit comprised two weapons of the chase, the \"bolas\" and the lasso. The bolas consists of three balls tied together by a leathern string,\nwhich are fastened to the front of the saddle. The Indians frequently\nthrow them the distance of a hundred paces at the animal or enemy that\nthey are pursuing, and with such precision that they twist about their\nlegs and bring them to the ground. It is, therefore, in their hands a\nformidable instrument, and they handle it with surprising dexterity. The lasso, on the contrary, does not leave the hand that wields it. It\nconsists simply of a leathern thong thirty feet in length, terminating\nin a slip-noose which works upon an iron ring. The right hand throws\nthe slip-noose, while the left hand holds the remainder of the lasso,\nthe end of which is firmly tied to the saddle. A long carbine in a\nsling completed the Patagonian's armament. Thalcave, without observing the admiration caused by his natural\ngrace, ease and courage, took the lead, and the party advanced, now\nat a gallop, and now at a walk, for their horses seemed entirely\nunaccustomed to trotting. Robert mounted with much boldness, and\nspeedily convinced Glenarvan of his ability to keep his seat. On issuing from the gorges of the Andes, they encountered a great\nnumber of sand-ridges, called \"medanos,\" real waves incessantly\nagitated by the wind, when the roots of the herbage did not confine\nthem to the earth. This sand is of an extreme fineness; and, at the\nleast breath, they saw it float away in light clouds, or form regular\nsand-columns which rose to a considerable height. This spectacle caused\npleasure as well as annoyance to the eyes. Pleasure, for nothing was\nmore curious than these columns, wandering over the plain, struggling,\nmingling, sinking and rising in inexpressible confusion; and annoyance,\nsince an impalpable dust emanated from these innumerable medanos and\npenetrated the eyelids, however tightly they were closed.

They encamped on the shores of a turbulent stream, enclosed by lofty\nred cliffs. Toward noon of the next day, the sun's rays became very\noppressive, and at evening a line of clouds on the horizon indicated\na change in the weather. The Patagonian could not be deceived, and\npointed out to the geographer the western portion of the sky. \"Good, I know,\" said Paganel, and addressing his companions: \"A change\nin the weather is about to take place.

I\ncan affirm from the taste that it has come from a distance, and,\nconsequently, the whole herd.\" \"You are certain of this?\" said Glenarvan. \"Absolutely so.\" \"But what event could have terrified these animals so, and driven them\nat a time when they ought to be peacefully sleeping in their lairs.\" \"As to that, my dear Glenarvan,\" said Paganel, \"it is impossible for me\nto say. If you believe me, let us search no farther. For my part I am\ndying for want of sleep. Let us retire, major!\" \"Very well, Paganel.\" Thereupon each wrapped himself in his poncho, the fuel was replenished\nfor the night, and soon all but Glenarvan were buried in profound\nrepose. He alone did not sleep. A secret uneasiness held him in a state of\nwakeful fatigue. He could not help thinking of that herd, flying in one\ncommon direction, of their inexplicable terror. They could not have\nbeen pursued by wild beasts: at that height there were scarcely any,\nand yet fewer hunters. What fright had driven them over the abysses\nof Antuco, and what was the cause of it? He thought of their strange\nsituation, and felt a presentiment of coming danger. However, under the influence of a partial drowsiness, his ideas\ngradually modified, and fear gave place to hope. He saw himself in\nanticipation, on the morrow, on the plain at the foot of the Andes. There his actual search was to begin; and success was not, perhaps, far\ndistant. He thought of Captain Grant and his two sailors, delivered\nfrom a cruel slavery. These images passed rapidly before his mind, every instant interrupted\nby a flash of fire, a spark, a flame, illumining the faces of his\nsleeping companions, and casting a flickering shadow over the walls of\nthe hut.", "similarity": 0.2734431028366089}]}

His eccentricities (and his abilities) made him much talked of in\nScotland. People seemed as though they could not show him enough\nattention. Just at this time an amiable lady of thirty, none other than the\nmajor's cousin, a little eccentric herself, but still agreeable and\ncharming, fell in love with the geographer's peculiarities. Paganel was\nfar from being insensible to Miss Arabella's attractions, yet did not\ndare to declare his sentiments. The major accordingly undertook the\npart of Cupid's messenger between these two congenial hearts, and even\ntold Paganel that marriage was \"the last blunder\" that he could commit. But the geographer was very much embarrassed, and, strangely enough,\ncould not summon courage to speak for himself. [Illustration: Early in the afternoon the travelers reached Malcolm\nCastle, amidst the hurrahs of their tenantry and friends.] \"Does not Miss Arabella please you?\" MacNabb would say to him. \"Oh, major, she is charming!\" cried Paganel,--\"a thousand times too\ncharming for me; and, if I must tell you, would please me better if she\nwere less so. I should like to find a defect.\" \"Be easy,\" answered the major; \"she has more than one. The most perfect\nwoman always has her share. Well, then, Paganel, are you decided?\" \"I do not dare.\" \"But, my learned friend, why do you hesitate?\" \"I am unworthy of her!\" was the geographer's invariable reply. At last, one day, driven desperate by the irrepressible major, Paganel\nconfessed to him, under the pledge of secrecy, a peculiarity that would\nfacilitate his identification, if the police should ever be on his\ntrack! \"Bah!\" exclaimed the major. \"It is as I tell you,\" persisted Paganel. \"What matter, my worthy friend?\" \"Is that your opinion?\" \"On the contrary, you are only more remarkable.

A year after his arrival\nin the country, Sergeant Manuel was naturalized, joined the Argentine\narmy, and married an honest Indian woman, who had twins,--boys, to be\nsure, for the sergeant's worthy consort would never present him with\ndaughters. Manuel did not think of any other calling than that of the\nsoldier, and hoped, in time, with the help of God, to offer to the\nrepublic a whole battalion of young soldiers. \"You have seen them?\" said he. \"Charming fellows! Good soldiers! José! Juan! Miguel! Pepe! Pepe is only seven years old, and is already biting\nhis cartridge!\" Pepe, hearing himself complimented, joined his two little feet, and\npresented arms with perfect precision. \"He will do!\" added the sergeant. \"He will be a major--or\nbrigadier-general one day!\" This story lasted a quarter of an hour, to Thalcave's great\nastonishment. The Indian could not understand how so many words could\ncome from a single throat. No one interrupted the commander; and even\na French sergeant had to conclude at last, though not without forcing\nhis guests to accompany him to his dwelling. Here they were introduced\nto Madame Ipharaguerre, who appeared to be \"a good-looking person,\" if\nthis expression may be employed in regard to an Indian. When he had exhausted himself, the sergeant asked his guests to what he\nowed the honor of their visit. And now it was their turn to explain. Paganel, opening the conversation in French, told him of their journey\nacross the Pampas, and ended by asking why the Indians had abandoned\nthe country. \"War!\" replied the sergeant. \"War?\" \"Yes, civil war.\" \"Civil war?\" rejoined Paganel. \"Yes, war between Paraguay and Buenos Ayres,\" answered the sergeant. \"Well?\" \"Why, all the Indians of the north are in the rear of General Flores,\nand those of the plains are plundering.\" \"But the caziques?\" \"The caziques with them.\" This answer was reported to Thalcave, who shook his head. Indeed,\nhe either did not know, or had forgotten, that a civil war, which\nwas afterwards to involve Brazil, was decimating two-thirds of the\nrepublic. The Indians had everything to gain in these internal\nstruggles, and could not neglect such fine opportunities for plunder. The sergeant, therefore, was not mistaken in attributing this desertion\nof the Pampas to the civil war that was being waged in the northern\npart of the Argentine Provinces. But this event disconcerted Glenarvan's hopes. If Captain Grant was\na prisoner of the caziques, he must have been carried by them to the\nnorthern frontiers. Yet how and where to find him? Must they attempt\na perilous and almost useless search to the northern limits of the\nPampas? It was a serious matter, which was to be earnestly considered. However, one important question was still to be asked of the sergeant,\nand the major thought of this, while his companions were looking at\neach other in silence. \"Have you heard of any Europeans being retained as prisoners by the\ncaziques of the Pampas?\" Manuel reflected for a few moments, like a man who recalls events to\nrecollection. \"Yes,\" said he, at length. \"Ah!\" cried Glenarvan, conceiving a new hope.

The abandoned\nman could therefore employ his time to advantage. Nothing was wanting,\nnot even books, foremost among which was a Bible. The hour for separation had come. The crew and passengers stood on\ndeck. More than one felt the heart strangely moved. Lady Helena and\nMary Grant could not repress their emotion. \"Must it then be so?\" inquired the young wife of her husband. \"Must\nthis unfortunate be abandoned?\" [Sidenote: \"FAREWELL! A LONG FAREWELL!\"] \"He must, Helena,\" answered Glenarvan. \"It is his punishment.\" At this moment the boat, commanded by Captain Mangles, started. Ayrton\nraised his hat and gave a grave salute. Glenarvan and the crew returned\nthis last farewell, as if to a man about to die, as he departed, in a\nprofound silence. On reaching the shore, Ayrton leaped upon the sand, and the boat\nreturned. It was then four o'clock in the afternoon, and from the upper\ndeck the passengers could see the quartermaster, with folded arms,\nstanding motionless as a statue, on a rock, and gazing at the vessel. \"Shall we start, my lord?\" asked Captain Mangles. \"Yes, John,\" replied Glenarvan, quickly, with more emotion than he\nwished to manifest. \"All right!\" cried the captain to the engineer.

Eleven days after leaving Tabor Island the Duncan came in sight of the\nAustralian coast, and anchored in Talcahuana Bay. Five months had elapsed\nsince her departure from this port, during which time the travelers\nhad made the circuit of the world on this thirty-seventh parallel. Their efforts had not been in vain, for they had found the shipwrecked\nsurvivors of the Britannia. The Duncan, having taken in her necessary stores, skirted the coasts\nof Patagonia, doubled Cape Horn, and steamed across the Atlantic. The\nvoyage was very uneventful. The yacht carried a full complement of\nhappy people; there seemed to be no secrets on board. A mystery, however, still perplexed MacNabb. Why did Paganel always\nkeep hermetically incased in his clothes, and wear a comforter over\nhis ears? The major longed to know the motive for this singular fancy. But in spite of his questions, hints, and suspicions, Paganel did not\nunbutton his coat. At last, fifty-three days after leaving Talcahuana, Captain Mangles\ndescried the lighthouse of Cape Clear. The vessel entered St. George's\nChannel, crossed the Irish Sea, and passed into the Frith of Clyde. At\neleven o'clock they anchored at Dumbarton, and early in the afternoon\nthe travelers reached Malcolm Castle, amidst the hurrahs of their\ntenantry and friends. Thus it was that Harry Grant and his two companions were rescued, and\nthat John Mangles married Mary Grant in the old cathedral of St. Mungo,\nwhere the Rev.

Austin, the sailors, the major, and Robert especially, were\ndelighted to revive their hopes, and applauded the worthy geographer.

Yet, looking at his calm and\npassionless countenance, you could not have divined the depth of his\nanguish, for in his present critical situation he did not betray the\nextent of his misfortunes. He felt that he ought to set an example of\nfortitude to his wife and his companions, as being the husband and\nchief. Moreover, he was ready to die first for the common safety, if\ncircumstances should require it. [Sidenote: CHIEFS, CIVILIZED AND UNCIVILIZED.] His companions were worthy of him; they shared his noble thoughts, and\ntheir calm and haughty appearance would scarcely have intimated that\nthey were being carried away to captivity and suffering. By common\nconsent, at Glenarvan's suggestion, they had resolved to feign a proud\nindifference in the presence of the savages. It was the only way of\ninfluencing those fierce natures. [Illustration: A boat might have been seen ascending the Waikato. It\nwas a canoe seventy feet long and five broad.] Since leaving the encampment, the natives, taciturn like all savages,\nhad scarcely spoken to each other. However, from a few words exchanged,\nGlenarvan perceived that they were acquainted with the English\nlanguage. He therefore resolved to question the chief in regard to the\nfate that was in store for them. Addressing Kai-Koumou, he said, in a\nfearless tone:\n\n\"Where are you taking us, chief?\" Kai-Koumou gazed at him coldly without answering. \"Say, what do you expect to do with us?\" continued Glenarvan. The chief's eyes blazed with a sudden light, and in a stern voice he\nreplied:\n\n\"To exchange you, if your friends will ransom you; to kill you, if they\nrefuse.\" Glenarvan asked no more, but hope returned to his heart. Doubtless,\nsome chiefs of the Maori tribe had fallen into the hands of the\nEnglish, and the natives would attempt to recover them by way of\nexchange; their situation, therefore, was not one for despair. Meantime the canoe rapidly ascended the river. Paganel, whose\nchangeable disposition carried him from one extreme to another, had\nregained his hopefulness. He believed that the Maoris were sparing them\nthe fatigue of their journey to the English settlements, and that they\nwere certain to arrive at their destination. He was, therefore, quite\nresigned to his lot, and traced on his map the course of the Waikato\nacross the plains and valleys of the province. Lady Helena and Mary\nGrant, suppressing their terror, conversed in low tones with Glenarvan,\nand the most skillful physiognomist could not have detected on their\nfaces the anxiety of their hearts. The Waikato River is worshiped by the natives, as Paganel knew, and\nEnglish and German naturalists have never ascended beyond its junction\nwith the Waipa. Whither did Kai-Koumou intend to take his captives? The geographer could not have guessed if the word \"Taupo,\" frequently\nrepeated, had not attracted his attention. By consulting his map,\nhe saw that this name was applied to a celebrated lake in the most\nmountainous part of the island, and that from it the Waikato flows. Paganel, addressing Captain Mangles in French, so as not to be\nunderstood by the savages, asked him how fast the canoe was going.

The bodies of Kara-Tété and his wife were taken up, and their limbs\nbent and gathered against the stomach, according to the New Zealand\ncustom. The place for the tomb had been chosen outside of the\nfortification, about two miles distant, on the summit of a small\nmountain, called Maunganamu, situated on the right shore of the lake. Thither the bodies were to be carried. Two very rude palanquins, or\nrather litters, were brought to the foot of the mound. The corpses,\nfolded together, in a sitting posture, and tied in their clothes by a\ngirdle of withes, were placed on this primitive bier. Four warriors\nbore it between them, and the entire tribe, chanting the funeral hymn,\nfollowed them in procession to the place of burial.

For about half an hour this funeral escort continued in sight, in the\ndepths of the valley. Finally they perceived it again winding along\nthe mountain paths. The distance gave a fantastic appearance to the\nundulating movements of the long, sinuous column. The tribe stopped at the summit of the mountain, which was eight\nhundred feet high, at the place prepared for Kara-Tété's interment. A common Maori would have had only a hole and a heap of stones for a\ngrave; but for a powerful and dreaded chief, destined doubtless for a\nspeedy deification, a tomb worthy of his exploits was reserved. [Sidenote: THE LAST NIGHT.] The sepulchre had been surrounded by palisades, while stakes,\nornamented with faces reddened with ochre, stood beside the grave\nwhere the bodies were to lie. The relatives had not forgotten that the\n\"waidoua\" (the spirit of the dead) feeds on substantial nourishment\nlike the body during this perishable life.

It is a good idea of these savages to\ncarry their weapons to heaven with them.\" \"But these are English guns!\" said the major. \"Doubtless,\" replied Glenarvan; \"it is a very foolish custom to make\npresents of fire-arms to the savages, who then use them against the\ninvaders, and with reason.

The amount of food testified their esteem for the virtues\nof the chief. There were provisions enough to last ten persons fifteen\ndays, or rather the deceased for eternity. They consisted of ferns,\nsweet yams, and potatoes, which were introduced some time before by the\nEuropeans. Tall vases of fresh water stood near, and a dozen baskets,\nartistically woven, contained numerous tablets of green gum. The fugitives were, therefore, fortified for several days against\nhunger and thirst, and they needed no urging to take their first meal\nat the chief's expense. Glenarvan directed Mr. Olbinett's attention\nto the food necessary for his companions; but he, with his usual\nexactness, even in critical situations, thought the bill of fare rather\nscanty. Moreover, he did not know how to prepare the roots, and there\nwas no fire. But Paganel solved the difficulty, and advised him to simply bury his\nferns and potatoes in the ground itself, for the heat of the upper\nstrata was very great. Olbinett, however, narrowly escaped a serious\nscalding, for, just as he had dug a hole to put his roots in, a stream\nof watery vapor burst forth, and rose to the height of several feet.

During the life of the chief they had undergone the\nseverest privations, suffered a thousand abuses, had been scantily fed,\nand compelled constantly to labor like beasts; and now, according to\nthe Maori belief, they were to continue their existence of servitude\nfor eternity. They appeared to be resigned to their fate, and were not astonished\nat a sacrifice they had long anticipated. Their freedom from all\nbonds showed that they would meet death unresistingly. Moreover, this\ndeath was rapid, protracted sufferings were spared them. These were\nreserved for the captives who stood trembling not twenty paces distant. Six blows of the méré, given by six stalwart warriors, stretched the\nvictims on the ground in a pool of blood. It was the signal for a\nterrible scene of cannibalism, which followed in all its horrible\ndetails. Glenarvan and his companions, breathless with fright, strove to hide\nthis awful scene from the eyes of the two unhappy ladies.

At this moment a commotion took place among the natives. Glenarvan cast\na rapid glance around him. The crowd opened, and a warrior, dripping\nwith sweat and overcome with fatigue, appeared. As soon as Kai-Koumou perceived him, he said in English, evidently that\nhe might be understood by the captives:\n\n\"You come from the camp of the pale-faces?\" \"Yes,\" replied the Maori. \"You saw the prisoner, our Tohonga?\" \"I did.\" \"Is he living?\" \"He is dead! The English have shot him.\" The fate of Glenarvan and his companions was settled. \"You shall all die to-morrow at daybreak!\" cried Kai-Koumou. The unfortunates were therefore to suffer a common death. Lady Helena\nand Mary Grant raised towards heaven a look of thankfulness. The captives were not taken back to the temple. They were to attend\nthat day the funeral of the dead chief, and the bloody ceremonies\nconnected therewith. A party of natives conducted them to the foot of\nan enormous koudi, where these guardians remained without losing sight\nof their prisoners. The rest of the tribe, absorbed in their official\nmourning, seemed to have forgotten them. The customary three days had elapsed since the death of Kara-Tété. The\nsoul of the deceased had therefore forever abandoned its mortal abode. The sacred rites began. The body was carried to a small mound in the centre of the\nfortification, clothed in splendid costume, and enveloped in a\nmagnificent flaxen mat. The head was adorned with plumes, and wore a\ncrown of green leaves. The face, arms, and breast had been rubbed with\noil, and therefore showed no mortification. The parents and friends of the deceased came to the foot of the\nmound, and all at once, as if some director were beating time to a\nfuneral dirge, a great concert of cries, groans, and sobs arose on the\nair.

A chief,\nequal in rank to Kai-Koumou, advanced with measured pace, and, rubbing\nhis nose against that of the latter, saluted him cordially. The\nprisoners were stationed in the centre of the encampment, and guarded\nwith extreme vigilance. The next morning the ascent of the Waikato was resumed. Other boats\ncame from various affluents of the river. Sixty warriors, evidently\nfugitives from the last insurrection, had now assembled, and were\nreturning, more or less wounded in the fray, to the mountain districts. Sometimes a song arose from the canoes, as they advanced in single\nfile. One native struck up the patriotic ode of the mysterious \"Pihé,\"\nthe national hymn that calls the Maoris to battle. The full and\nsonorous voice of the singer waked the echoes of the mountains; and\nafter each stanza his comrades struck their breasts, and sang the\nwarlike verses in chorus. Then they seized their oars again, and the\ncanoes were headed up stream. During the day a singular sight enlivened the voyage. About four\no'clock the canoe, without lessening its speed, guided by the steady\nhand of the chief, dashed through a narrow gorge. Eddies broke\nviolently against numerous small islands, which rendered navigation\nexceeding dangerous. Never could it be more hazardous to capsize, for\nthe banks afforded no refuge, and whoever had set foot on the porous\ncrust of the shore would probably have perished. At this point the\nriver flowed between warm springs, oxide of iron colored the muddy\nground a brilliant red, and not a yard of firm earth could be seen. The air was heavy with a penetrating sulphureous odor. The natives did\nnot regard it, but the captives were seriously annoyed by the noxious\nvapors exhaled from the fissures of the soil and the bubbles that\nburst and discharged their gaseous contents. Yet, however disagreeable\nthese emanations were, the eye could not but admire this magnificent\nspectacle. [Illustration: At this point the river flowed between warm springs, and\nnot a yard of firm earth could be seen.] The canoes soon after entered a dense cloud of white smoke, whose\nwreaths rose in gradually decreasing circles above the river. On the\nshores a hundred geysers, some shooting forth masses of vapor, and\nothers overflowing in liquid columns, varied their effects, like the\njets and cascades of a fountain. It seemed as though some engineer was\ndirecting at his pleasure the outflowings of these springs, as the\nwaters and vapor, mingling in the air, formed rainbows in the sunbeams. For two miles the canoes glided within this vapory atmosphere,\nenveloped in its warm waves that rolled along the surface of the water. Then the sulphureous smoke disappeared, and a pure swift current of\nfresh air refreshed the panting voyagers. The region of the springs was\npassed. Before the close of the day two more rapids were ascended, and\nat evening Kai-Koumou encamped a hundred miles above the junction of\nthe two streams. The river now turned towards the east, and then again\nflowed southward into Lake Taupo. The next morning Jacques Paganel consulted his map and discovered\non the right bank Mount Taubara, which rises to the height of three\nthousand feet. At noon the whole fleet of boats entered Lake Taupo, and\nthe natives hailed with frantic gestures a shred of cloth that waved in\nthe wind from the roof of a hut. It was the national flag.

In my opinion this man's\nreal name is Ayrton. Ben Joyce is his fighting title. It is certain\nthat he knows Harry Grant, and has been quartermaster on board the\nBritannia. These facts, proved already by the precise details given\nby Ayrton, are still further corroborated by the conversation of the\nconvicts that I have related. Let us not, therefore, be led astray\nby vain conjectures, but only be certain that Ayrton is Ben Joyce, a\nsailor of the Britannia, now chief of a band of convicts.\" The major's explanation was accepted as conclusive. \"Now,\" replied Glenarvan, \"will you tell me how and why Harry Grant's\nquartermaster is in Australia?\" \"How, I do not know,\" said MacNabb; \"and the police declare they know\nno more than I on the subject.

But one serious fact appeared from this explanation. No one had yet\nthought of it; only Mary Grant, disregarding the past, looked forward\nto the future. Captain Mangles first saw her pale and disconsolate. He\nunderstood what was passing in her mind. \"Miss Mary!\" cried he, \"you are weeping!\" \"What is the matter, my child?\" asked Lady Helena. \"My father, madam, my father!\" replied the young girl.

Hope had reanimated all hearts. These courageous travelers\nforgot their past trials, dreaded not the future, and only rejoiced in\ntheir present deliverance; although very little reflection would show\nhow difficult was the task of reaching an European settlement from\ntheir present position. But if Kai-Koumou was outwitted, they believed\nthemselves safe from all the savages of New Zealand. A whole day must pass before the decisive attempt could be made, and\nthey employed their time in arranging a plan of escape. Paganel had\npreserved his map of New Zealand, and could therefore search out the\nsafest routes. After some discussion, the fugitives resolved to proceed eastward\ntowards the Bay of Plenty. This course would lead them through\ndistricts that were very rarely visited. The travelers, who were\nalready accustomed to overcoming natural difficulties, only feared\nmeeting the Maoris. They therefore determined to avoid them at all\nhazards, and gain the eastern coast, where the missionaries have\nfounded several establishments. Moreover, this portion of the island\nhad hitherto escaped the ravages of the war and the depredations of the\nnatives. As for the distance that separated Lake Taupo from the Bay of\nPlenty, it could not be more than one hundred miles. Ten days would\nsuffice for the journey. The missions once reached, they could rest\nthere, and wait for some favorable opportunity of gaining Auckland,\ntheir destination. These points being settled, they continued to watch the savages till\nevening. Not one of them remained at the foot of the mountain, and\nwhen darkness invaded the valleys of the lake, no fire betokened the\npresence of the Maoris at the base of the peak. The coast was clear. At nine o'clock it was dark night, and Glenarvan gave the signal for\ndeparture. His companions and he, armed and equipped at Kara-Tété's\nexpense, began to cautiously descend the slopes of the Maunganamu. Captain Mangles and Wilson led the way, with eyes and ears on the\nalert. They stopped at the least sound,--they examined the faintest\nlight; each slid down the declivity, the better to elude detection. Two hundred feet below the summit, Captain Mangles and his sailor\nreached the dangerous ridge that had been so obstinately guarded by the\nnatives. If, unfortunately, the Maoris, more crafty than the fugitives,\nhad feigned a retreat to entice them within reach, if they had not\nbeen deceived by the eruption, their presence would be discovered\nat this point. Glenarvan, in spite of his confidence and Paganel's\npleasantries, could not help trembling. The safety of his friends was\nat stake during the few moments necessary to cross the ridge. He felt\nLady Helena's heart beat as she clung to his arm. But neither he nor Captain Mangles thought of retreating. The young\ncaptain, followed by the others, and favored by the dense obscurity,\ncrawled along the narrow path, only stopping when some detached stone\nrolled to the base of the mountain. If the savages were still in\nambush, these unusual sounds would provoke from each side a formidable\nvolley. However, in gliding like serpents along this inclined crest, the\nfugitives could not advance rapidly. When Captain Mangles had gained\nthe lowest part, scarcely twenty-five feet separated him from the\nplain where the natives had encamped the night before.

He allowed this bloody orgy an hour to reach its utmost\nintensity. The last act of the funeral was played with the usual rites. The bodies of Kara-Tété and his wife were taken up, and their limbs\nbent and gathered against the stomach, according to the New Zealand\ncustom. The place for the tomb had been chosen outside of the\nfortification, about two miles distant, on the summit of a small\nmountain, called Maunganamu, situated on the right shore of the lake. Thither the bodies were to be carried. Two very rude palanquins, or\nrather litters, were brought to the foot of the mound. The corpses,\nfolded together, in a sitting posture, and tied in their clothes by a\ngirdle of withes, were placed on this primitive bier. Four warriors\nbore it between them, and the entire tribe, chanting the funeral hymn,\nfollowed them in procession to the place of burial. The captives, who were always watched, saw them leave the inner\ninclosure of the pah, and then the songs and cries gradually died away. For about half an hour this funeral escort continued in sight, in the\ndepths of the valley. Finally they perceived it again winding along\nthe mountain paths. The distance gave a fantastic appearance to the\nundulating movements of the long, sinuous column. The tribe stopped at the summit of the mountain, which was eight\nhundred feet high, at the place prepared for Kara-Tété's interment. A common Maori would have had only a hole and a heap of stones for a\ngrave; but for a powerful and dreaded chief, destined doubtless for a\nspeedy deification, a tomb worthy of his exploits was reserved. [Sidenote: THE LAST NIGHT.] The sepulchre had been surrounded by palisades, while stakes,\nornamented with faces reddened with ochre, stood beside the grave\nwhere the bodies were to lie. The relatives had not forgotten that the\n\"waidoua\" (the spirit of the dead) feeds on substantial nourishment\nlike the body during this perishable life. Food had therefore been\ndeposited in the inclosure, together with the weapons and clothes of\nthe deceased. Nothing was wanting for the comfort of the tomb.

His protruding and deeply furrowed\nbrow, his fierce look and his sinister countenance, showed him to be a\nformidable individual. He was a Maori chief of high rank, as could be seen by the delicate\nand compact tattooing that striped his face and body. Two black\nspirals, starting from the nostrils of his aquiline nose, circled his\ntawny eyes, met on his forehead, and were lost in his abundant hair. His mouth, with its shining teeth, and his chin, were hidden beneath\na net-work of varied colors, while graceful lines wound down to his\nsinewy breast. There was no doubt as to his rank. The sharp albatross bone, used\nby Maori tattooers, had furrowed his face five times, in close and\ndeep lines. That he had reached his fifth promotion was evident from\nhis haughty bearing. A large flaxen mat, ornamented with dog-skins,\nenveloped his person; while a girdle, bloody with his recent conflicts,\nencircled his waist. From his ears dangled ear-rings of green jade, and\naround his neck hung necklaces of \"pounamous,\" sacred stones to which\nthe New Zealanders attribute miraculous properties. At his side lay a\ngun of English manufacture, and a \"patou-patou,\" a kind of double-edged\nhatchet.

The two women were resigned to their fate, while\nthe men concealed their anguish beneath a calmness that showed\nsuperhuman self-control. They came before the chief, who did not delay\nsentence. \"You killed Kara-Tété!\" said he to Glenarvan. \"I did.\" [Sidenote: THE BEGINNING OF THE END.] \"You shall die to-morrow at sunrise.\" \"Alone?\" inquired Glenarvan, whose heart beat quickly. \"What! as if our Tohonga's life were not more precious than yours!\" cried Kai-Koumou, whose eyes expressed a fierce regret. At this moment a commotion took place among the natives. Glenarvan cast\na rapid glance around him. The crowd opened, and a warrior, dripping\nwith sweat and overcome with fatigue, appeared. As soon as Kai-Koumou perceived him, he said in English, evidently that\nhe might be understood by the captives:\n\n\"You come from the camp of the pale-faces?\" \"Yes,\" replied the Maori. \"You saw the prisoner, our Tohonga?\" \"I did.\" \"Is he living?\" \"He is dead! The English have shot him.\" The fate of Glenarvan and his companions was settled. \"You shall all die to-morrow at daybreak!\" cried Kai-Koumou. The unfortunates were therefore to suffer a common death. Lady Helena\nand Mary Grant raised towards heaven a look of thankfulness. The captives were not taken back to the temple. They were to attend\nthat day the funeral of the dead chief, and the bloody ceremonies\nconnected therewith. A party of natives conducted them to the foot of\nan enormous koudi, where these guardians remained without losing sight\nof their prisoners. The rest of the tribe, absorbed in their official\nmourning, seemed to have forgotten them. The customary three days had elapsed since the death of Kara-Tété. The\nsoul of the deceased had therefore forever abandoned its mortal abode. The sacred rites began. The body was carried to a small mound in the centre of the\nfortification, clothed in splendid costume, and enveloped in a\nmagnificent flaxen mat. The head was adorned with plumes, and wore a\ncrown of green leaves. The face, arms, and breast had been rubbed with\noil, and therefore showed no mortification. The parents and friends of the deceased came to the foot of the\nmound, and all at once, as if some director were beating time to a\nfuneral dirge, a great concert of cries, groans, and sobs arose on the\nair. They mourned the dead in plaintive and modulated cadences.", "similarity": 0.47229456901550293}, {"chunk_id": 223, "text": "It would be difficult to describe the joy that reigned within the\npalisade.

These courageous travelers\nforgot their past trials, dreaded not the future, and only rejoiced in\ntheir present deliverance; although very little reflection would show\nhow difficult was the task of reaching an European settlement from\ntheir present position. But if Kai-Koumou was outwitted, they believed\nthemselves safe from all the savages of New Zealand. A whole day must pass before the decisive attempt could be made, and\nthey employed their time in arranging a plan of escape. Paganel had\npreserved his map of New Zealand, and could therefore search out the\nsafest routes. After some discussion, the fugitives resolved to proceed eastward\ntowards the Bay of Plenty. This course would lead them through\ndistricts that were very rarely visited. The travelers, who were\nalready accustomed to overcoming natural difficulties, only feared\nmeeting the Maoris. They therefore determined to avoid them at all\nhazards, and gain the eastern coast, where the missionaries have\nfounded several establishments. Moreover, this portion of the island\nhad hitherto escaped the ravages of the war and the depredations of the\nnatives. As for the distance that separated Lake Taupo from the Bay of\nPlenty, it could not be more than one hundred miles. Ten days would\nsuffice for the journey. The missions once reached, they could rest\nthere, and wait for some favorable opportunity of gaining Auckland,\ntheir destination. These points being settled, they continued to watch the savages till\nevening. Not one of them remained at the foot of the mountain, and\nwhen darkness invaded the valleys of the lake, no fire betokened the\npresence of the Maoris at the base of the peak. The coast was clear. At nine o'clock it was dark night, and Glenarvan gave the signal for\ndeparture. His companions and he, armed and equipped at Kara-Tété's\nexpense, began to cautiously descend the slopes of the Maunganamu. Captain Mangles and Wilson led the way, with eyes and ears on the\nalert. They stopped at the least sound,--they examined the faintest\nlight; each slid down the declivity, the better to elude detection. Two hundred feet below the summit, Captain Mangles and his sailor\nreached the dangerous ridge that had been so obstinately guarded by the\nnatives. If, unfortunately, the Maoris, more crafty than the fugitives,\nhad feigned a retreat to entice them within reach, if they had not\nbeen deceived by the eruption, their presence would be discovered\nat this point. Glenarvan, in spite of his confidence and Paganel's\npleasantries, could not help trembling. The safety of his friends was\nat stake during the few moments necessary to cross the ridge. He felt\nLady Helena's heart beat as she clung to his arm. But neither he nor Captain Mangles thought of retreating. The young\ncaptain, followed by the others, and favored by the dense obscurity,\ncrawled along the narrow path, only stopping when some detached stone\nrolled to the base of the mountain. If the savages were still in\nambush, these unusual sounds would provoke from each side a formidable\nvolley. However, in gliding like serpents along this inclined crest, the\nfugitives could not advance rapidly. When Captain Mangles had gained\nthe lowest part, scarcely twenty-five feet separated him from the\nplain where the natives had encamped the night before. Here the ridge\nascended quite steeply towards a coppice about a quarter of a mile\ndistant.

He is prisoner\nof the Pakekas (Europeans). Our god commands us to ransom his life. I would have torn out your heart, I would have hung your companions'\nheads and yours forever to the stakes of this palisade. But Nouï-Atoua\nhas spoken.\" So saying, Kai-Koumou, who had hitherto controlled himself, trembled\nwith rage, and his countenance was flushed with a fierce exultation. Then, after a few moments, he resumed, more coolly:\n\n\"Do you think the English will give us our Tohonga in exchange for you?\" Glenarvan hesitated, and watched the Maori chief very attentively. \"I do not know,\" said he, after a moment's silence. \"Speak,\" continued Kai-Koumou. \"Is your life worth that of our Tohonga?\" \"No,\" answered Glenarvan. \"I am neither a chief nor a priest among my\npeople.\" Paganel was astounded at this reply, and gazed at Glenarvan in profound\nwonder. Kai-Koumou seemed equally surprised. \"Then you doubt it?\" said he. \"I do not know,\" repeated Glenarvan. \"Will not your people accept you in exchange for our Tohonga?\" \"Not me alone,\" replied Glenarvan; \"but perhaps all of us.\" \"Among the Maoris,\" said Kai-Koumou, \"it is one for one.\" \"Offer these ladies first in exchange for your priest,\" answered\nGlenarvan, pointing to Lady Helena and Mary Grant. Lady Helena would\nhave rushed towards her husband, but the major restrained her. \"These two ladies,\" continued Glenarvan, turning respectfully towards\nthem, \"hold a high rank in their country.\" The warrior glanced coldly at his prisoner. A malicious smile passed\nover his face; but he almost instantly repressed it, and replied, in a\nvoice which he could scarcely control:\n\n\"Do you hope, then, to deceive Kai-Koumou by false words, cursed\nEuropean? Do you think that Kai-Koumou's eyes cannot read your heart?\" Then, pointing to Lady Helena, he said:\n\n\"That is your wife!\" \"No, mine!\" cried Kara-Tété. Then, pushing back the prisoners, the chief laid his hand on Lady\nHelena's shoulder, who grew pale at the touch. \"Edward!\" cried the unfortunate woman, in terror. Glenarvan, without uttering a word, raised his arm. A report resounded. Kara-Tété fell dead. At this sound a crowd of natives issued from the huts. The pah was\nfilled in an instant. A hundred arms were raised against the captives. Glenarvan's revolver was snatched from his hand. Kai-Koumou cast a strange look at Glenarvan, and then, guarding with\none hand the person of him who had fired, he controlled with the other\nthe throng that was rushing upon the Europeans. [Illustration: At last his voice rose above the tumult. \"Taboo! taboo!\" cried he.] At last his voice rose above the tumult. \"Taboo! taboo!\" cried he.

[Illustration: A terrible scene of cannibalism, which followed in all\nits horrible details.] [Illustration: The corpses, folded together, in a sitting posture,\nand tied in their clothes by a girdle of withes, were placed on this\nprimitive bier.] But Kai-Koumou had preserved his reason in the midst of the general\nintoxication. He allowed this bloody orgy an hour to reach its utmost\nintensity. The last act of the funeral was played with the usual rites. The bodies of Kara-Tété and his wife were taken up, and their limbs\nbent and gathered against the stomach, according to the New Zealand\ncustom. The place for the tomb had been chosen outside of the\nfortification, about two miles distant, on the summit of a small\nmountain, called Maunganamu, situated on the right shore of the lake. Thither the bodies were to be carried. Two very rude palanquins, or\nrather litters, were brought to the foot of the mound. The corpses,\nfolded together, in a sitting posture, and tied in their clothes by a\ngirdle of withes, were placed on this primitive bier. Four warriors\nbore it between them, and the entire tribe, chanting the funeral hymn,\nfollowed them in procession to the place of burial. The captives, who were always watched, saw them leave the inner\ninclosure of the pah, and then the songs and cries gradually died away. For about half an hour this funeral escort continued in sight, in the\ndepths of the valley. Finally they perceived it again winding along\nthe mountain paths. The distance gave a fantastic appearance to the\nundulating movements of the long, sinuous column. The tribe stopped at the summit of the mountain, which was eight\nhundred feet high, at the place prepared for Kara-Tété's interment. A common Maori would have had only a hole and a heap of stones for a\ngrave; but for a powerful and dreaded chief, destined doubtless for a\nspeedy deification, a tomb worthy of his exploits was reserved. [Sidenote: THE LAST NIGHT.] The sepulchre had been surrounded by palisades, while stakes,\nornamented with faces reddened with ochre, stood beside the grave\nwhere the bodies were to lie. The relatives had not forgotten that the\n\"waidoua\" (the spirit of the dead) feeds on substantial nourishment\nlike the body during this perishable life. Food had therefore been\ndeposited in the inclosure, together with the weapons and clothes of\nthe deceased. Nothing was wanting for the comfort of the tomb. Husband and wife were\nlaid side by side, and then covered with earth and grass after a series\nof renewed lamentations. Then the procession silently descended the\nmountain, and now no one could ascend it under penalty of death, for it\nwas tabooed. CHAPTER LI. STRANGELY LIBERATED. Just as the sun was disappearing behind Lake Taupo, the captives were\nled back to their prison. They were not to leave it again until the\nsummit of the Wahiti mountains should kindle with the first beams of\nthe day. One night remained to prepare for death. In spite of the\nfaintness, in spite of the horror with which they were seized, they\nshared their repast in common. \"We shall need all the strength possible to face death,\" said\nGlenarvan. \"We must show these barbarians how Europeans and Christians\ncan die.\"", "similarity": 0.4539392590522766}, {"chunk_id": 198, "text": "His name was well known to the English soldiers, and\na price had been set upon his head by the governor of New Zealand.

Yet, looking at his calm and\npassionless countenance, you could not have divined the depth of his\nanguish, for in his present critical situation he did not betray the\nextent of his misfortunes. He felt that he ought to set an example of\nfortitude to his wife and his companions, as being the husband and\nchief. Moreover, he was ready to die first for the common safety, if\ncircumstances should require it. [Sidenote: CHIEFS, CIVILIZED AND UNCIVILIZED.] His companions were worthy of him; they shared his noble thoughts, and\ntheir calm and haughty appearance would scarcely have intimated that\nthey were being carried away to captivity and suffering. By common\nconsent, at Glenarvan's suggestion, they had resolved to feign a proud\nindifference in the presence of the savages. It was the only way of\ninfluencing those fierce natures. [Illustration: A boat might have been seen ascending the Waikato. It\nwas a canoe seventy feet long and five broad.] Since leaving the encampment, the natives, taciturn like all savages,\nhad scarcely spoken to each other. However, from a few words exchanged,\nGlenarvan perceived that they were acquainted with the English\nlanguage. He therefore resolved to question the chief in regard to the\nfate that was in store for them. Addressing Kai-Koumou, he said, in a\nfearless tone:\n\n\"Where are you taking us, chief?\" Kai-Koumou gazed at him coldly without answering. \"Say, what do you expect to do with us?\" continued Glenarvan. The chief's eyes blazed with a sudden light, and in a stern voice he\nreplied:\n\n\"To exchange you, if your friends will ransom you; to kill you, if they\nrefuse.\" Glenarvan asked no more, but hope returned to his heart. Doubtless,\nsome chiefs of the Maori tribe had fallen into the hands of the\nEnglish, and the natives would attempt to recover them by way of\nexchange; their situation, therefore, was not one for despair. Meantime the canoe rapidly ascended the river. Paganel, whose\nchangeable disposition carried him from one extreme to another, had\nregained his hopefulness. He believed that the Maoris were sparing them\nthe fatigue of their journey to the English settlements, and that they\nwere certain to arrive at their destination. He was, therefore, quite\nresigned to his lot, and traced on his map the course of the Waikato\nacross the plains and valleys of the province. Lady Helena and Mary\nGrant, suppressing their terror, conversed in low tones with Glenarvan,\nand the most skillful physiognomist could not have detected on their\nfaces the anxiety of their hearts. The Waikato River is worshiped by the natives, as Paganel knew, and\nEnglish and German naturalists have never ascended beyond its junction\nwith the Waipa. Whither did Kai-Koumou intend to take his captives? The geographer could not have guessed if the word \"Taupo,\" frequently\nrepeated, had not attracted his attention. By consulting his map,\nhe saw that this name was applied to a celebrated lake in the most\nmountainous part of the island, and that from it the Waikato flows. Paganel, addressing Captain Mangles in French, so as not to be\nunderstood by the savages, asked him how fast the canoe was going.

I am seized with a\nterrible, perhaps mortal illness; I can feel that the paroxysm is fast\napproaching.", "similarity": 0.35675400495529175}, {"chunk_id": 84, "text": "“He was wealthy once, perhaps?” said the inspector. “Or dreamed he was, and awoke mad.”\n\n“After all,” said the inspector, “if he had been rich, he would not\nhave been here.”\n\nSo the matter ended for the Abbé Faria. He remained in his cell, and\nthis visit only increased the belief in his insanity. Caligula or Nero, those treasure-seekers, those desirers of the\nimpossible, would have accorded to the poor wretch, in exchange for his\nwealth, the liberty he so earnestly prayed for. But the kings of modern\ntimes, restrained by the limits of mere probability, have neither\ncourage nor desire. They fear the ear that hears their orders, and the\neye that scrutinizes their actions. Formerly they believed themselves\nsprung from Jupiter, and shielded by their birth; but nowadays they are\nnot inviolable. It has always been against the policy of despotic governments to suffer\nthe victims of their persecutions to reappear. As the Inquisition\nrarely allowed its victims to be seen with their limbs distorted and\ntheir flesh lacerated by torture, so madness is always concealed in its\ncell, from whence, should it depart, it is conveyed to some gloomy\nhospital, where the doctor has no thought for man or mind in the\nmutilated being the jailer delivers to him. The very madness of the\nAbbé Faria, gone mad in prison, condemned him to perpetual captivity. The inspector kept his word with Dantès; he examined the register, and\nfound the following note concerning him:\n\n_Edmond Dantès:_\n\nViolent Bonapartist; took an active part in the return from Elba. The greatest watchfulness and care to be exercised. This note was in a different hand from the rest, which showed that it\nhad been added since his confinement. The inspector could not contend\nagainst this accusation; he simply wrote, _Nothing to be done._\n\nThis visit had infused new vigor into Dantès; he had, till then,\nforgotten the date; but now, with a fragment of plaster, he wrote the\ndate, 30th July, 1816, and made a mark every day, in order not to lose\nhis reckoning again. Days and weeks passed away, then months—Dantès\nstill waited; he at first expected to be freed in a fortnight. This\nfortnight expired, he decided that the inspector would do nothing until\nhis return to Paris, and that he would not reach there until his\ncircuit was finished, he therefore fixed three months; three months\npassed away, then six more. Finally ten months and a half had gone by\nand no favorable change had taken place, and Dantès began to fancy the\ninspector’s visit but a dream, an illusion of the brain. At the expiration of a year the governor was transferred; he had\nobtained charge of the fortress at Ham. He took with him several of his\nsubordinates, and amongst them Dantès’ jailer. A new governor arrived;\nit would have been too tedious to acquire the names of the prisoners;\nhe learned their numbers instead. This horrible place contained fifty\ncells; their inhabitants were designated by the numbers of their cell,\nand the unhappy young man was no longer called Edmond Dantès—he was now\nnumber 34. Chapter 15. Number 34 and Number 27\n\nDantès passed through all the stages of torture natural to prisoners in\nsuspense. He was sustained at first by that pride of conscious\ninnocence which is the sequence to hope; then he began to doubt his own\ninnocence, which justified in some measure the governor’s belief in his\nmental alienation; and then, relaxing his sentiment of pride, he\naddressed his supplications, not to God, but to man.

It was thought reliance might be placed in General Quesnel; he was\nrecommended to us from the Island of Elba; one of us went to him, and\ninvited him to the Rue Saint-Jacques, where he would find some friends. He came there, and the plan was unfolded to him for leaving Elba, the\nprojected landing, etc. When he had heard and comprehended all to the\nfullest extent, he replied that he was a royalist. Then all looked at\neach other,—he was made to take an oath, and did so, but with such an\nill grace that it was really tempting Providence to swear thus, and\nyet, in spite of that, the general was allowed to depart free—perfectly\nfree.

Villefort,\ntherefore, gained nothing save the king’s gratitude (which was rather\nlikely to injure him at the present time) and the cross of the Legion\nof Honor, which he had the prudence not to wear, although M. de Blacas\nhad duly forwarded the brevet. Napoleon would, doubtless, have deprived Villefort of his office had it\nnot been for Noirtier, who was all powerful at court, and thus the\nGirondin of ’93 and the Senator of 1806 protected him who so lately had\nbeen his protector. All Villefort’s influence barely enabled him to\nstifle the secret Dantès had so nearly divulged. The king’s procureur\nalone was deprived of his office, being suspected of royalism. However, scarcely was the imperial power established—that is, scarcely\nhad the emperor re-entered the Tuileries and begun to issue orders from\nthe closet into which we have introduced our readers,—he found on the\ntable there Louis XVIII.’s half-filled snuff-box,—scarcely had this\noccurred when Marseilles began, in spite of the authorities, to\nrekindle the flames of civil war, always smouldering in the south, and\nit required but little to excite the populace to acts of far greater\nviolence than the shouts and insults with which they assailed the\nroyalists whenever they ventured abroad. 0159m\n\n\n\nOwing to this change, the worthy shipowner became at that moment—we\nwill not say all powerful, because Morrel was a prudent and rather a\ntimid man, so much so, that many of the most zealous partisans of\nBonaparte accused him of “moderation”—but sufficiently influential to\nmake a demand in favor of Dantès. Villefort retained his place, but his marriage was put off until a more\nfavorable opportunity. If the emperor remained on the throne, Gérard\nrequired a different alliance to aid his career; if Louis XVIII. returned, the influence of M. de Saint-Méran, like his own, could be\nvastly increased, and the marriage be still more suitable. The deputy\nprocureur was, therefore, the first magistrate of Marseilles, when one\nmorning his door opened, and M. Morrel was announced. Anyone else would have hastened to receive him; but Villefort was a man\nof ability, and he knew this would be a sign of weakness.

Morrel to be admitted. Morrel expected Villefort would be dejected; he found him as he had\nfound him six weeks before, calm, firm, and full of that glacial\npoliteness, that most insurmountable barrier which separates the\nwell-bred from the vulgar man. He had entered Villefort’s office expecting that the magistrate would\ntremble at the sight of him; on the contrary, he felt a cold shudder\nall over him when he saw Villefort sitting there with his elbow on his\ndesk, and his head leaning on his hand.

[Illustration: A boat might have been seen ascending the Waikato. It\nwas a canoe seventy feet long and five broad.] Since leaving the encampment, the natives, taciturn like all savages,\nhad scarcely spoken to each other. However, from a few words exchanged,\nGlenarvan perceived that they were acquainted with the English\nlanguage. He therefore resolved to question the chief in regard to the\nfate that was in store for them. Addressing Kai-Koumou, he said, in a\nfearless tone:\n\n\"Where are you taking us, chief?\" Kai-Koumou gazed at him coldly without answering. \"Say, what do you expect to do with us?\" continued Glenarvan. The chief's eyes blazed with a sudden light, and in a stern voice he\nreplied:\n\n\"To exchange you, if your friends will ransom you; to kill you, if they\nrefuse.\" Glenarvan asked no more, but hope returned to his heart. Doubtless,\nsome chiefs of the Maori tribe had fallen into the hands of the\nEnglish, and the natives would attempt to recover them by way of\nexchange; their situation, therefore, was not one for despair. Meantime the canoe rapidly ascended the river. Paganel, whose\nchangeable disposition carried him from one extreme to another, had\nregained his hopefulness.

Lady Helena and Mary\nGrant, suppressing their terror, conversed in low tones with Glenarvan,\nand the most skillful physiognomist could not have detected on their\nfaces the anxiety of their hearts. The Waikato River is worshiped by the natives, as Paganel knew, and\nEnglish and German naturalists have never ascended beyond its junction\nwith the Waipa. Whither did Kai-Koumou intend to take his captives? The geographer could not have guessed if the word \"Taupo,\" frequently\nrepeated, had not attracted his attention. By consulting his map,\nhe saw that this name was applied to a celebrated lake in the most\nmountainous part of the island, and that from it the Waikato flows.

Paganel also told, at great length, the tales of many of the sad\nincidents which from time to time have marked even the commercial\nintercourse between the European and the Maori; as, for instance, the\nsad tale of conflict and bloodshed connected with the death of Captain\nMarion, a French navigator, in 1772. He had landed near the spot where\nSurville had ill-treated some of the natives and traitorously seized\na son of the chief, Takouri, who yet appeared to welcome this next\nFrench visitant, though remembering none the less the terrible duty of\nvengeance which is felt by the Maori to be so binding. [Illustration: It was on the sixth of October, 1769, that this\nnavigator (Captain Cook) first landed on the shores.] For a long time the cloak of friendship was worn by the natives, the\nmore thoroughly to lull the suspicions of the whites, and to entice a\nlarger number on shore; in which endeavor they succeeded only too well. The French ships being greatly out of repair, Marion was induced to\nfell timber at some distance in the interior, and to establish in this\noccupation a great number of his men, going frequently to them, and\nremaining with them and the apparently friendly chiefs. On one of these\noccasions the Maoris fulfilled their revengeful project with a terrible\nsatisfaction to themselves. Only one man, of all those in the interior,\nmanaged to escape, the commander himself falling a prey to their\nvengeance. They then endeavored to kill the second in command, who,\nwith several others, was nearer to the shore. These, of course, at once\nstarted for their boats; breathless, they reached them, hotly pursued\nto the water's edge by the insatiate savages.

Such is this strange Lake Taupo, elevated eleven hundred and fifty\nfeet above the level of the sea, and surrounded by lofty mountains. On\nthe west of the prisoners towered precipitous rocks of imposing form;\non the north rose several distant ridges, crowned with small forests;\non the east spread a broad plain furrowed by a trail and covered with\npumice-stones that glittered beneath a net-work of bushes; and on\nthe north, behind a stretch of woodland, volcanic peaks majestically\nencircled this vast extent of water, the fury of whose tempests equaled\nthat of the ocean cyclones. But Paganel was scarcely disposed to enlarge his account of these\nwonders, nor were his friends in a mood to listen. They gazed in\nsilence towards the northeast shore of the lake, whither the canoe was\nbringing them. The mission established at Pukawa, on the western shores, no longer\nexisted. The missionary had been driven by the war far from the\nprincipal dwellings of the insurrectionists. The prisoners were\nhelpless, abandoned to the mercy of the vengeful Maoris, and in that\nwild part of the island to which Christianity has never penetrated. Kai-Koumou, leaving the waters of the Waikato, passed through the\nlittle creek which served as an outlet to the river, doubled a sharp\npromontory, and landed on the eastern border of the lake, at the base\nof the first slopes of Mount Manga. A quarter of a mile distant, on a buttress of the mountain, appeared\na \"pah,\" a Maori fortification, situated in an impregnable position. The prisoners were taken ashore, with their hands and feet free, and\nconducted thither by the warriors. After quite a long détour, Glenarvan\nand his companions reached the pah. [Illustration: At noon the whole fleet of boats entered Lake Taupo.] [Illustration: On their arrival, the captives were terribly impressed\nat sight of the heads that ornamented the stakes of the second\ninclosure.] This fortress was defended by an outer rampart of strong palisades,\nfifteen feet high. A second line of stakes, and then a fence of osiers,\npierced with loop-holes, inclosed the inner space, the court-yard of\nthe pah, in which stood several Maori tents, and forty huts which were\nsymmetrically arranged. On their arrival, the captives were terribly impressed at sight of\nthe heads that ornamented the stakes of the second inclosure. Lady\nHelena and Mary Grant turned away their eyes with more of disgust than\nterror. These heads had most of them belonged to hostile chiefs, fallen\nin battle, whose bodies had served as food for the conquerors. The\ngeographer knew them to be such by their hollow and eyeless sockets! In Kai-Koumou's pah only the heads of his enemies formed this frightful\nmuseum; and here, doubtless, more than one English skull had served to\nincrease the size of the chief's collection. His hut, among those belonging to warriors of lower rank, stood at the\nrear of the pah, in front of a large open terrace. This structure was\nbuilt of stakes, interlaced with branches, and lined inside with flax\nmatting. Only one opening gave access to the dwelling.", "similarity": 0.48472484946250916}, {"chunk_id": 207, "text": "The parents and friends of the deceased came to the foot of the\nmound, and all at once, as if some director were beating time to a\nfuneral dirge, a great concert of cries, groans, and sobs arose on the\nair. They mourned the dead in plaintive and modulated cadences. His\nrelations struck their heads together; his kinswomen lacerated their\nfaces with their nails, and showed themselves more lavish of blood than\nof tears. These unfortunate females conscientiously fulfilled their\nbarbarous duty. But these demonstrations were not enough to appease the soul of the\ndeceased, whose wrath would doubtless have smitten the survivors of his\ntribe; and his warriors, as they could not recall him to life, wished\nthat he should have no cause to regret in the other world the happiness\nof this. Kara-Tété's wife was not to forsake her husband in the tomb. Moreover,\nthe unfortunate woman would not have been allowed to survive him;\nit was the custom, in accordance with duty, and examples of such\nsacrifices are not wanting in New Zealand history. The woman appeared. She was still young. Her hair floated in disorder over her shoulders. Vague words, lamentations, and broken phrases, in which she celebrated\nthe virtues of the dead, interrupted her groans; and, in a final\nparoxysm of grief, she stretched herself at the foot of the mound,\nbeating the ground with her head. At this moment Kai-Koumou approached her. Suddenly the unfortunate\nvictim rose; but a violent blow with the \"méré,\" a formidable club,\nwielded by the hand of the chief, struck her lifeless to the earth. [Sidenote: POOR HUMANITY!] Frightful cries at once broke forth. A hundred arms threatened the\ncaptives, who trembled at the horrible sight. But no one stirred, for\nthe funeral ceremonies were not ended. Kara-Tété's wife had joined her husband in the other world. Both bodies\nlay side by side. But for the eternal life his faithful spouse could\nnot alone suffice the deceased. Who would serve them in presence of\nNouï-Atoua, if their slaves did not follow them? Six unfortunates were brought before the corpse of their master and\nmistress. They were servants, whom the pitiless laws of war had reduced\nto slavery. During the life of the chief they had undergone the\nseverest privations, suffered a thousand abuses, had been scantily fed,\nand compelled constantly to labor like beasts; and now, according to\nthe Maori belief, they were to continue their existence of servitude\nfor eternity. They appeared to be resigned to their fate, and were not astonished\nat a sacrifice they had long anticipated. Their freedom from all\nbonds showed that they would meet death unresistingly. Moreover, this\ndeath was rapid, protracted sufferings were spared them. These were\nreserved for the captives who stood trembling not twenty paces distant. Six blows of the méré, given by six stalwart warriors, stretched the\nvictims on the ground in a pool of blood. It was the signal for a\nterrible scene of cannibalism, which followed in all its horrible\ndetails. Glenarvan and his companions, breathless with fright, strove to hide\nthis awful scene from the eyes of the two unhappy ladies. They now\nunderstood what awaited them at sunrise the next day, and what cruel\ntortures would doubtless precede such a death. They were dumb with\nhorror. The funeral dance now began. Strong spirits, extracted from an\nindigenous plant, maddened the savages till they seemed no longer\nhuman.", "similarity": 0.4062299132347107}, {"chunk_id": 198, "text": "His name was well known to the English soldiers, and\na price had been set upon his head by the governor of New Zealand. This terrible catastrophe had come upon Glenarvan just as he was\nabout reaching the long-desired harbor of Auckland, whence he would\nhave returned to his native country. Yet, looking at his calm and\npassionless countenance, you could not have divined the depth of his\nanguish, for in his present critical situation he did not betray the\nextent of his misfortunes. He felt that he ought to set an example of\nfortitude to his wife and his companions, as being the husband and\nchief. Moreover, he was ready to die first for the common safety, if\ncircumstances should require it. [Sidenote: CHIEFS, CIVILIZED AND UNCIVILIZED.] His companions were worthy of him; they shared his noble thoughts, and\ntheir calm and haughty appearance would scarcely have intimated that\nthey were being carried away to captivity and suffering. By common\nconsent, at Glenarvan's suggestion, they had resolved to feign a proud\nindifference in the presence of the savages. It was the only way of\ninfluencing those fierce natures. [Illustration: A boat might have been seen ascending the Waikato. It\nwas a canoe seventy feet long and five broad.] Since leaving the encampment, the natives, taciturn like all savages,\nhad scarcely spoken to each other. However, from a few words exchanged,\nGlenarvan perceived that they were acquainted with the English\nlanguage. He therefore resolved to question the chief in regard to the\nfate that was in store for them. Addressing Kai-Koumou, he said, in a\nfearless tone:\n\n\"Where are you taking us, chief?\" Kai-Koumou gazed at him coldly without answering. \"Say, what do you expect to do with us?\" continued Glenarvan. The chief's eyes blazed with a sudden light, and in a stern voice he\nreplied:\n\n\"To exchange you, if your friends will ransom you; to kill you, if they\nrefuse.\" Glenarvan asked no more, but hope returned to his heart. Doubtless,\nsome chiefs of the Maori tribe had fallen into the hands of the\nEnglish, and the natives would attempt to recover them by way of\nexchange; their situation, therefore, was not one for despair. Meantime the canoe rapidly ascended the river. Paganel, whose\nchangeable disposition carried him from one extreme to another, had\nregained his hopefulness. He believed that the Maoris were sparing them\nthe fatigue of their journey to the English settlements, and that they\nwere certain to arrive at their destination. He was, therefore, quite\nresigned to his lot, and traced on his map the course of the Waikato\nacross the plains and valleys of the province. Lady Helena and Mary\nGrant, suppressing their terror, conversed in low tones with Glenarvan,\nand the most skillful physiognomist could not have detected on their\nfaces the anxiety of their hearts. The Waikato River is worshiped by the natives, as Paganel knew, and\nEnglish and German naturalists have never ascended beyond its junction\nwith the Waipa. Whither did Kai-Koumou intend to take his captives? The geographer could not have guessed if the word \"Taupo,\" frequently\nrepeated, had not attracted his attention. By consulting his map,\nhe saw that this name was applied to a celebrated lake in the most\nmountainous part of the island, and that from it the Waikato flows. Paganel, addressing Captain Mangles in French, so as not to be\nunderstood by the savages, asked him how fast the canoe was going. The\ncaptain thought about three miles an hour.", "similarity": 0.4390900135040283}, {"chunk_id": 180, "text": "However, he was not deterred from rehearsing how one and\nanother not merely visited, but began to settle, on the island, so that\nin the treaty of 1814 it was formally recognized as belonging to Great\nBritain, and twenty years after was important enough to have a separate\nofficial and governmental establishment. Paganel also told, at great length, the tales of many of the sad\nincidents which from time to time have marked even the commercial\nintercourse between the European and the Maori; as, for instance, the\nsad tale of conflict and bloodshed connected with the death of Captain\nMarion, a French navigator, in 1772. He had landed near the spot where\nSurville had ill-treated some of the natives and traitorously seized\na son of the chief, Takouri, who yet appeared to welcome this next\nFrench visitant, though remembering none the less the terrible duty of\nvengeance which is felt by the Maori to be so binding. [Illustration: It was on the sixth of October, 1769, that this\nnavigator (Captain Cook) first landed on the shores.] For a long time the cloak of friendship was worn by the natives, the\nmore thoroughly to lull the suspicions of the whites, and to entice a\nlarger number on shore; in which endeavor they succeeded only too well. The French ships being greatly out of repair, Marion was induced to\nfell timber at some distance in the interior, and to establish in this\noccupation a great number of his men, going frequently to them, and\nremaining with them and the apparently friendly chiefs. On one of these\noccasions the Maoris fulfilled their revengeful project with a terrible\nsatisfaction to themselves. Only one man, of all those in the interior,\nmanaged to escape, the commander himself falling a prey to their\nvengeance. They then endeavored to kill the second in command, who,\nwith several others, was nearer to the shore. These, of course, at once\nstarted for their boats; breathless, they reached them, hotly pursued\nto the water's edge by the insatiate savages. Then, safe themselves,\nthe French marksmen picked off the chief, and the previous exultation\nof the aborigines was, even in the hour of their triumph, turned to\nlamentation, coupled with wonder at the terrible power of the white\nman's fire-barrel. [Illustration: Safe themselves, the French marksmen picked off the\nchief.] All this and much more did the geographer narrate; but it must be\nconfessed that he neither spoke, nor did they listen, with the\ncomplacency evinced in his previous tales. Besides, their surroundings\nwere at the time uncomfortable, and the first prognostications of a\nspeedy passage were not likely to be verified. Unfortunately, this painful voyage was prolonged. Six days after her\ndeparture, the Macquarie had not descried the shores of Auckland. The wind was fair, however, and still blew from the southwest; but\nnevertheless the brig did not make much headway. The sea was rough, the\nrigging creaked, the ribs cracked, and the vessel rode the waves with\ndifficulty. Fortunately, Will Halley, like a man who was in no hurry, did not crowd\non sail, or his masts would inevitably have snapped. Captain Mangles\nhoped, therefore, that this clumsy craft would reach its destination\nin safety; still, he was pained to see his companions on board in such\nmiserable quarters. [Sidenote: PERSISTENT GRIEF.] But neither Lady Helena nor Mary Grant complained, although the\ncontinual rain kept them confined, and the want of air and rolling of\nthe ship seriously incommoded them.", "similarity": 0.38269972801208496}]}

The tunic soon disappeared under a long\ncassock, as did his hair under a priest’s wig; the three-cornered hat\nover this effectually transformed the count into an abbé. The man, hearing nothing more, stood erect, and while Monte Cristo was\ncompleting his disguise had advanced straight to the secretaire, whose\nlock was beginning to crack under his nightingale. “Try again,” whispered the count, who depended on the secret spring,\nwhich was unknown to the picklock, clever as he might be—“try again,\nyou have a few minutes’ work there.”\n\nAnd he advanced to the window. The man whom he had seen seated on a\nfence had got down, and was still pacing the street; but, strange as it\nappeared, he cared not for those who might pass from the avenue of the\nChamps-Élysées or by the Faubourg Saint-Honoré; his attention was\nengrossed with what was passing at the count’s, and his only aim\nappeared to be to discern every movement in the dressing-room.

Kai-Koumou, according to a custom quite ordinary in New Zealand, joined\nthe rank of priest to that of chief, and could, therefore, extend to\npersons or objects the superstitious protection of the taboo. The taboo, which is common to the tribes of Polynesia, has the power\nto prohibit at once all connection with the object or person tabooed. According to the Maori religion, whoever should lay his sacrilegious\nhand on what is declared taboo would be punished with death by the\noffended god; and in case the divinity should delay to avenge his own\ninsult, the priests would not fail to excite his anger. As for the prisoners confined in the temple, the taboo had rescued\nthem from the fury of the tribe. Some of the natives, the friends and\npartisans of Kai-Koumou, had stopped suddenly at the command of their\nchief, and had protected the captives. [Sidenote: THE TORTURES OF SUSPENSE.] Glenarvan, however, was not blind to the fate that was reserved for\nhim. Only his death could atone for the murder of a chief. Among savage\nraces death is always preceded by a protracted torture. He therefore\nexpected to cruelly expiate the righteous indignation that had nerved\nhis arm, but hoped that Kai-Koumou's rage would fall only on himself. What a night he and his companions passed! Who could depict their\nanguish, or measure their sufferings? Neither poor Robert nor brave\nPaganel had reappeared. But how could they doubt their fate? Were they\nnot the first victims of the natives' vengeance? All hope had vanished\neven from the heart of the major, who did not easily despair. John\nMangles felt himself growing mad at sight of the sad dejection of Mary\nGrant, thus separated from her brother. Glenarvan thought of that\nterrible request of Lady Helena, who, rather than yield to torture or\nslavery, preferred to die by his hand. Could he summon this fearful\ncourage? As for an escape, that was plainly impossible. Ten warriors,\narmed to the teeth, guarded the entrance of the temple. Morning came at last. There had been no communication between the\nnatives and the prisoners. The hut contained a considerable quantity\nof food, which the unfortunates scarcely touched. Hunger gave place to\ngrief. The day passed without bringing a change or a hope. Doubtless\nthe hour for the dead chief's funeral and their torture would be the\nsame. However, although Glenarvan concluded that Kai-Koumou must have\nabandoned all idea of exchange, the major on this point retained a\ngleam of hope. \"Who knows,\" said he, reminding Glenarvan of the effect produced upon\nthe chief by the death of Kara-Tété,--\"who knows but that Kai-Koumou in\nreality feels obliged to you?\" But, in spite of these observations, Glenarvan would no longer hope. The next day also passed away without the preparations for torture\nbeing made. The reason of the delay was this. The Maoris believe that the soul, for three days after death, inhabits\nthe body of the deceased, and therefore during this time the corpse\nremains unburied. This custom was rigorously observed, and for two days\nthe pah was deserted. Captain Mangles frequently stood on Wilson's\nshoulders and surveyed the fortification.

The bodies of Kara-Tété and his wife were taken up, and their limbs\nbent and gathered against the stomach, according to the New Zealand\ncustom. The place for the tomb had been chosen outside of the\nfortification, about two miles distant, on the summit of a small\nmountain, called Maunganamu, situated on the right shore of the lake. Thither the bodies were to be carried. Two very rude palanquins, or\nrather litters, were brought to the foot of the mound.

For about half an hour this funeral escort continued in sight, in the\ndepths of the valley. Finally they perceived it again winding along\nthe mountain paths. The distance gave a fantastic appearance to the\nundulating movements of the long, sinuous column. The tribe stopped at the summit of the mountain, which was eight\nhundred feet high, at the place prepared for Kara-Tété's interment. A common Maori would have had only a hole and a heap of stones for a\ngrave; but for a powerful and dreaded chief, destined doubtless for a\nspeedy deification, a tomb worthy of his exploits was reserved.

The relatives had not forgotten that the\n\"waidoua\" (the spirit of the dead) feeds on substantial nourishment\nlike the body during this perishable life.

At last their situation was no longer tenable, and of two deaths they\nwere forced to choose the least cruel. \"To the water!\" cried Glenarvan. [Illustration: In a few moments the gigantic water-spout struck the\nombu, and enveloped it in its watery folds.] Wilson, whom the flames had reached, had already plunged into the\ncurrent, when they heard him cry, in tones of the greatest terror,--\n\n\"Help! help!\" Austin rushed towards him and assisted him to regain the trunk. \"What is the matter?\" \"Caymans! caymans!\" replied Wilson. And, in truth, the foot of the\ntree was seen to be surrounded by the most formidable monsters. Their scales glittered in broad plates of light, sharply defined\nby the conflagration. Their flat tails, their pointed heads, their\nprotruding eyes, their jaws, extending back of their ears, all these\ncharacteristic signs were unmistakable. Paganel recognized the\nvoracious alligators peculiar to America, and called caymans in Spanish\ncountries. There were a dozen of them, beating the water with their\npowerful tails, and attacking the tree with their terrible teeth. At this sight the unfortunate travelers felt themselves lost indeed. A\nhorrible death was in store for them,--to perish either by the flames\nor by the teeth of the alligators. There are circumstances in which\nman is powerless to struggle, and where a raging element can only be\nrepulsed by another equally strong. Glenarvan, with a wild look, gazed\nat the fire and water leagued against him, not knowing what aid to\nimplore of Heaven. The storm had now begun to abate; but it had developed in the air a\ngreat quantity of vapor, which the electric phenomena were about to\nset in violent commotion. To the south an enormous water-spout was\ngradually forming,--an inverted cone of mist, uniting the raging waters\nbelow to the stormy clouds above. It advanced revolving with frightful\nrapidity, collected at its centre a liquid column, and by a powerful\nattraction, caused by its gyratory motion, drew towards it all the\nsurrounding currents of air. [Sidenote: A STRANGE BARK.] In a few moments the gigantic water-spout struck the ombu and enveloped\nit in its watery folds. The tree was shaken to its very base, so that\nGlenarvan might have thought that the alligators had attacked it\nwith their powerful jaws and were uprooting it from the ground.", "similarity": 0.3821902573108673}, {"chunk_id": 206, "text": "But on the third day the huts were opened. The savages, men, women,\nand children, to the number of several hundreds, assembled in the pah,\nsilent and calm. Kai-Koumou came out of his house, and, surrounded by\nthe principal warriors of his tribe, took his place on a mound several\nfeet high in the centre of the fortification. The crowd of natives\nformed a semicircle around him, and the whole assembly preserved\nabsolute silence. At a sign from the chief, a warrior advanced towards the temple. \"Remember!\" said Lady Helena to her husband. Glenarvan clasped his wife to his heart. At this moment Mary Grant\napproached John Mangles. \"Lord and Lady Glenarvan,\" said she, \"I think that, if a wife can die\nby the hand of her husband to escape a degrading existence, a maiden\ncan likewise die by the hand of her lover. John (for I may tell you\nat this critical moment), have I not long been your betrothed in the\ndepths of your heart? May I rely upon you, dear John, as Lady Helena\ndoes upon Lord Glenarvan?\" \"Mary!\" cried the young captain, in terror. \"Ah! dear Mary----\"\n\nHe could not finish: the mat was raised, and the captives were dragged\ntowards Kai-Koumou. The two women were resigned to their fate, while\nthe men concealed their anguish beneath a calmness that showed\nsuperhuman self-control. They came before the chief, who did not delay\nsentence. \"You killed Kara-Tété!\" said he to Glenarvan. \"I did.\" [Sidenote: THE BEGINNING OF THE END.] \"You shall die to-morrow at sunrise.\" \"Alone?\" inquired Glenarvan, whose heart beat quickly. \"What! as if our Tohonga's life were not more precious than yours!\" cried Kai-Koumou, whose eyes expressed a fierce regret. At this moment a commotion took place among the natives. Glenarvan cast\na rapid glance around him. The crowd opened, and a warrior, dripping\nwith sweat and overcome with fatigue, appeared. As soon as Kai-Koumou perceived him, he said in English, evidently that\nhe might be understood by the captives:\n\n\"You come from the camp of the pale-faces?\" \"Yes,\" replied the Maori. \"You saw the prisoner, our Tohonga?\" \"I did.\" \"Is he living?\" \"He is dead! The English have shot him.\" The fate of Glenarvan and his companions was settled. \"You shall all die to-morrow at daybreak!\" cried Kai-Koumou. The unfortunates were therefore to suffer a common death. Lady Helena\nand Mary Grant raised towards heaven a look of thankfulness. The captives were not taken back to the temple. They were to attend\nthat day the funeral of the dead chief, and the bloody ceremonies\nconnected therewith. A party of natives conducted them to the foot of\nan enormous koudi, where these guardians remained without losing sight\nof their prisoners. The rest of the tribe, absorbed in their official\nmourning, seemed to have forgotten them. The customary three days had elapsed since the death of Kara-Tété. The\nsoul of the deceased had therefore forever abandoned its mortal abode. The sacred rites began. The body was carried to a small mound in the centre of the\nfortification, clothed in splendid costume, and enveloped in a\nmagnificent flaxen mat. The head was adorned with plumes, and wore a\ncrown of green leaves. The face, arms, and breast had been rubbed with\noil, and therefore showed no mortification. The parents and friends of the deceased came to the foot of the\nmound, and all at once, as if some director were beating time to a\nfuneral dirge, a great concert of cries, groans, and sobs arose on the\nair.

Moreover,\nthe unfortunate woman would not have been allowed to survive him;\nit was the custom, in accordance with duty, and examples of such\nsacrifices are not wanting in New Zealand history. The woman appeared. She was still young. Her hair floated in disorder over her shoulders. Vague words, lamentations, and broken phrases, in which she celebrated\nthe virtues of the dead, interrupted her groans; and, in a final\nparoxysm of grief, she stretched herself at the foot of the mound,\nbeating the ground with her head. At this moment Kai-Koumou approached her. Suddenly the unfortunate\nvictim rose; but a violent blow with the \"méré,\" a formidable club,\nwielded by the hand of the chief, struck her lifeless to the earth. [Sidenote: POOR HUMANITY!] Frightful cries at once broke forth. A hundred arms threatened the\ncaptives, who trembled at the horrible sight. But no one stirred, for\nthe funeral ceremonies were not ended. Kara-Tété's wife had joined her husband in the other world. Both bodies\nlay side by side. But for the eternal life his faithful spouse could\nnot alone suffice the deceased. Who would serve them in presence of\nNouï-Atoua, if their slaves did not follow them? Six unfortunates were brought before the corpse of their master and\nmistress. They were servants, whom the pitiless laws of war had reduced\nto slavery. During the life of the chief they had undergone the\nseverest privations, suffered a thousand abuses, had been scantily fed,\nand compelled constantly to labor like beasts; and now, according to\nthe Maori belief, they were to continue their existence of servitude\nfor eternity. They appeared to be resigned to their fate, and were not astonished\nat a sacrifice they had long anticipated. Their freedom from all\nbonds showed that they would meet death unresistingly. Moreover, this\ndeath was rapid, protracted sufferings were spared them. These were\nreserved for the captives who stood trembling not twenty paces distant. Six blows of the méré, given by six stalwart warriors, stretched the\nvictims on the ground in a pool of blood. It was the signal for a\nterrible scene of cannibalism, which followed in all its horrible\ndetails. Glenarvan and his companions, breathless with fright, strove to hide\nthis awful scene from the eyes of the two unhappy ladies. They now\nunderstood what awaited them at sunrise the next day, and what cruel\ntortures would doubtless precede such a death. They were dumb with\nhorror. The funeral dance now began.

They soon became sonorous, and made the atmosphere vibrate in rapid\noscillations.

Soon the sky, from east to\nnorth, was crossed by a phosphorescent band of intense brilliancy. This\nillumination gradually overspread the entire horizon, lighting up the\nclouds like a bonfire, and was reflected in the mirror-like waters,\nforming what seemed to be an immense circle of fire, of which the tree\noccupied the centre.

Furious cries saluted the appearance of the Europeans as they issued\nfrom the desecrated tomb. Each cast a longing glance towards the surrounding mountains, the deep\nvalleys, still veiled in mist, and the surface of Lake Taupo, gently\nrippling beneath the morning wind. Then all, eager to know Paganel's\nnew project, gathered around him with questioning looks; while the\ngeographer at once satisfied the restless curiosity of his companions. \"My friends,\" said he, \"my project has this advantage, that if it does\nnot produce the result that I expect, or even fails, our situation will\nnot be impaired. But it ought to and will succeed.\" \"And this project?\" asked the major. \"This is it,\" replied Paganel. \"The superstition of the natives has\nmade this mountain a place of refuge, and this superstition must help\nus to escape. If I succeed in convincing Kai-Koumou that we have become\nthe victims of our sacrilege, that the wrath of Heaven has fallen upon\nus, in short, that we have met a terrible death, do you think that he\nwill abandon the mountain and return to his village?\" \"Probably,\" said Glenarvan. \"And with what horrible death do you threaten us?\" inquired Lady Helena. \"The death of the sacrilegious, my friends,\" continued Paganel. \"The\navenging flames are under our feet. Let us open a way for them.\" \"What! you would make a volcano?\" cried Captain Mangles. \"Yes, a factitious, an improvised one, whose fury we will control. There is quite a supply of vapors and subterranean fires that only\nask for an outlet. Let us arrange an artificial eruption for our own\nadvantage.\" \"The idea is good,\" said the major, \"and well conceived, Paganel.\" \"You understand,\" resumed the geographer, \"that we are to feign being\nconsumed by the flames of Pluto, and shall disappear spiritually in the\ntomb of Kara-Tété.\" [Sidenote: A VOLCANO IN MINIATURE.] \"Where we shall remain three, four, or five days, if necessary, till\nthe savages are convinced of our death, and abandon the siege.\" \"But if they think of making sure of our destruction,\" said Miss Grant,\n\"and climb the mountain?\" \"No, my dear Mary,\" replied Paganel, \"they will not do that.

But this is scarcely probable, especially if we play our part\nskillfully.\" \"And when shall we make this last venture?\" asked Lady Helena. \"This very evening,\" answered Paganel, \"at the hour of the greatest\ndarkness.\" \"Agreed,\" said MacNabb. \"Paganel, you are a man of genius; and although\nfrom habit I am scarcely ever enthusiastic, I will answer for your\nsuccess.

Kai-Koumou, according to a custom quite ordinary in New Zealand, joined\nthe rank of priest to that of chief, and could, therefore, extend to\npersons or objects the superstitious protection of the taboo. The taboo, which is common to the tribes of Polynesia, has the power\nto prohibit at once all connection with the object or person tabooed. According to the Maori religion, whoever should lay his sacrilegious\nhand on what is declared taboo would be punished with death by the\noffended god; and in case the divinity should delay to avenge his own\ninsult, the priests would not fail to excite his anger. As for the prisoners confined in the temple, the taboo had rescued\nthem from the fury of the tribe. Some of the natives, the friends and\npartisans of Kai-Koumou, had stopped suddenly at the command of their\nchief, and had protected the captives. [Sidenote: THE TORTURES OF SUSPENSE.] Glenarvan, however, was not blind to the fate that was reserved for\nhim. Only his death could atone for the murder of a chief. Among savage\nraces death is always preceded by a protracted torture. He therefore\nexpected to cruelly expiate the righteous indignation that had nerved\nhis arm, but hoped that Kai-Koumou's rage would fall only on himself. What a night he and his companions passed! Who could depict their\nanguish, or measure their sufferings? Neither poor Robert nor brave\nPaganel had reappeared. But how could they doubt their fate? Were they\nnot the first victims of the natives' vengeance? All hope had vanished\neven from the heart of the major, who did not easily despair. John\nMangles felt himself growing mad at sight of the sad dejection of Mary\nGrant, thus separated from her brother. Glenarvan thought of that\nterrible request of Lady Helena, who, rather than yield to torture or\nslavery, preferred to die by his hand. Could he summon this fearful\ncourage? As for an escape, that was plainly impossible. Ten warriors,\narmed to the teeth, guarded the entrance of the temple. Morning came at last. There had been no communication between the\nnatives and the prisoners. The hut contained a considerable quantity\nof food, which the unfortunates scarcely touched. Hunger gave place to\ngrief. The day passed without bringing a change or a hope. Doubtless\nthe hour for the dead chief's funeral and their torture would be the\nsame. However, although Glenarvan concluded that Kai-Koumou must have\nabandoned all idea of exchange, the major on this point retained a\ngleam of hope. \"Who knows,\" said he, reminding Glenarvan of the effect produced upon\nthe chief by the death of Kara-Tété,--\"who knows but that Kai-Koumou in\nreality feels obliged to you?\" But, in spite of these observations, Glenarvan would no longer hope. The next day also passed away without the preparations for torture\nbeing made. The reason of the delay was this. The Maoris believe that the soul, for three days after death, inhabits\nthe body of the deceased, and therefore during this time the corpse\nremains unburied. This custom was rigorously observed, and for two days\nthe pah was deserted. Captain Mangles frequently stood on Wilson's\nshoulders and surveyed the fortification. No native was seen; only the\nsentinels guarded in turn at the door of their prison. But on the third day the huts were opened.

From this point his view commanded the whole extent of the pah, as far\nas Kai-Koumou's hut. \"They have gathered around the chief,\" said he, in a low voice. \"They\nare waving their arms, and howling.

But will his warriors consent?\" \"Yes, they are listening to him,\" continued Robert. \"They are\ndispersing; some return to their huts,--others leave the fortification.\" \"Is it really so?\" cried the major. \"Yes, Mr. MacNabb,\" replied Robert. \"Kai-Koumou remains alone with the\nwarriors that were in the canoe.

The Maoris do not search their female prisoners; but this weapon\nis for us, Edward, not for them.\" \"Glenarvan,\" said MacNabb quickly, \"hide the revolver.

Around him were assembled the principal warriors of his tribe, among\nwhom was seen the chief whose canoe had first joined Kai-Koumou on the\nriver. He was a man of about forty, robust, and of fierce and cruel\naspect. His name was Kara-Tété, which means in the native language\n\"The Irascible.\" Kai-Koumou treated him with some respect, and from\nthe delicacy of his tattooing it was evident that he occupied a high\nrank in his tribe. An observer, however, would have detected a rivalry\nbetween the two chiefs. The major, indeed, perceived that Kara-Tété's\ninfluence surpassed that of Kai-Koumou. They both ruled the powerful\ntribes of the Waikato with equal rank; and, during this interview,\nalthough Kai-Koumou smiled, his eyes betrayed a deep hostility. He now questioned Glenarvan. \"You are English?\" said he. \"Yes,\" replied Glenarvan, without hesitation, for this nationality\nwould probably facilitate an exchange. [Sidenote: THE RATE OF BARTER.] \"And your companions?\" asked Kai-Koumou. \"My companions are also English.

Moreover, he was ready to die first for the common safety, if\ncircumstances should require it.

[Illustration: A boat might have been seen ascending the Waikato. It\nwas a canoe seventy feet long and five broad.] Since leaving the encampment, the natives, taciturn like all savages,\nhad scarcely spoken to each other. However, from a few words exchanged,\nGlenarvan perceived that they were acquainted with the English\nlanguage. He therefore resolved to question the chief in regard to the\nfate that was in store for them. Addressing Kai-Koumou, he said, in a\nfearless tone:\n\n\"Where are you taking us, chief?\" Kai-Koumou gazed at him coldly without answering. \"Say, what do you expect to do with us?\" continued Glenarvan. The chief's eyes blazed with a sudden light, and in a stern voice he\nreplied:\n\n\"To exchange you, if your friends will ransom you; to kill you, if they\nrefuse.\" Glenarvan asked no more, but hope returned to his heart. Doubtless,\nsome chiefs of the Maori tribe had fallen into the hands of the\nEnglish, and the natives would attempt to recover them by way of\nexchange; their situation, therefore, was not one for despair. Meantime the canoe rapidly ascended the river. Paganel, whose\nchangeable disposition carried him from one extreme to another, had\nregained his hopefulness. He believed that the Maoris were sparing them\nthe fatigue of their journey to the English settlements, and that they\nwere certain to arrive at their destination.

The Waikato River is worshiped by the natives, as Paganel knew, and\nEnglish and German naturalists have never ascended beyond its junction\nwith the Waipa. Whither did Kai-Koumou intend to take his captives? The geographer could not have guessed if the word \"Taupo,\" frequently\nrepeated, had not attracted his attention. By consulting his map,\nhe saw that this name was applied to a celebrated lake in the most\nmountainous part of the island, and that from it the Waikato flows.

The unfortunate horses neighed\nin terror without, exposed to the inclemency of the tempest; and their\nmasters did not suffer less in their miserable shelter. However, sleep\ndrowned all their troubles at last. Robert first closed his eyes,\nreclining his head on Lord Glenarvan's shoulder; and soon all the\ninmates of the rancho slept under the protection of God. They woke the next morning at the call of Thaouka, who, always ready,\nneighed without, and struck the wall of the hut vigorously with his\nhoof, as though to give the signal for departure. They owed him too\nmuch not to obey him, and they accordingly resumed their journey. The rain had ceased, but the hard earth held what had fallen. On the\nimpenetrable clay, pools, marshes, and ponds overflowed and formed\nimmense \"bañados\" of treacherous depth. Paganel, on consulting his map,\njudged rightly that the Grande and Nivarota Rivers, into which the\nwaters of the plain usually flow, must have mingled together in one\nbroad stream. An extremely rapid advance, therefore, became necessary. The common\nsafety was at stake. If the inundation increased, where could they find\na refuge? The vast circle of the horizon did not offer a single point,\nand on this level plain the progress of the water must be rapid. The\nhorses were urged to their utmost speed.

Suddenly, about six o'clock in the evening, he manifested signs of\nextreme agitation. He turned frequently towards the vast expanse to the\nsouth; his neighs were prolonged, his nostrils keenly snuffed the air,\nand he reared violently. Thalcave, whom his antics could not unseat,\nmanaged his steed without difficulty. The froth from the horse's mouth\nwas mingled with blood under the action of the firmly-closed bit, and\nyet the spirited animal could not be calm. If free, his master felt but\ntoo well that he would have fled away at full speed towards the north. \"What is the matter with Thaouka?\" asked Paganel. \"Has he been bitten\nby those voracious blood-suckers of the Argentine waters?\" \"No,\" replied the Indian. \"Is he terrified, then, at some danger?\" \"Yes, he has scented danger.\" \"What?\" \"I do not know.\" Although the eye did not yet reveal the peril that Thaouka divined,\nthe ear could already detect it. A low murmur, like the sound of a\nrising tide, was heard as from the limit of the horizon. The wind blew\nin damp gusts laden with spray; the birds, as if fleeing from some\nunknown phenomenon, shot swiftly through the air; and the horses,\nwading to their knees, felt the first impulse of the current. Soon a\nmingled roar, like bellowing, neighing, and bleating, resounded half\na mile to the south, and immense herds appeared, tumbling, rising,\nand rushing, a confused mass of terrified beasts, and fled by with\nfrightful rapidity. It was scarcely possible to distinguish them in the\nmidst of the clouds of spray dashed up by their flight.

This terrible catastrophe had come upon Glenarvan just as he was\nabout reaching the long-desired harbor of Auckland, whence he would\nhave returned to his native country. Yet, looking at his calm and\npassionless countenance, you could not have divined the depth of his\nanguish, for in his present critical situation he did not betray the\nextent of his misfortunes. He felt that he ought to set an example of\nfortitude to his wife and his companions, as being the husband and\nchief. Moreover, he was ready to die first for the common safety, if\ncircumstances should require it. [Sidenote: CHIEFS, CIVILIZED AND UNCIVILIZED.] His companions were worthy of him; they shared his noble thoughts, and\ntheir calm and haughty appearance would scarcely have intimated that\nthey were being carried away to captivity and suffering. By common\nconsent, at Glenarvan's suggestion, they had resolved to feign a proud\nindifference in the presence of the savages. It was the only way of\ninfluencing those fierce natures. [Illustration: A boat might have been seen ascending the Waikato. It\nwas a canoe seventy feet long and five broad.] Since leaving the encampment, the natives, taciturn like all savages,\nhad scarcely spoken to each other. However, from a few words exchanged,\nGlenarvan perceived that they were acquainted with the English\nlanguage. He therefore resolved to question the chief in regard to the\nfate that was in store for them. Addressing Kai-Koumou, he said, in a\nfearless tone:\n\n\"Where are you taking us, chief?\" Kai-Koumou gazed at him coldly without answering. \"Say, what do you expect to do with us?\" continued Glenarvan. The chief's eyes blazed with a sudden light, and in a stern voice he\nreplied:\n\n\"To exchange you, if your friends will ransom you; to kill you, if they\nrefuse.\" Glenarvan asked no more, but hope returned to his heart. Doubtless,\nsome chiefs of the Maori tribe had fallen into the hands of the\nEnglish, and the natives would attempt to recover them by way of\nexchange; their situation, therefore, was not one for despair. Meantime the canoe rapidly ascended the river. Paganel, whose\nchangeable disposition carried him from one extreme to another, had\nregained his hopefulness. He believed that the Maoris were sparing them\nthe fatigue of their journey to the English settlements, and that they\nwere certain to arrive at their destination. He was, therefore, quite\nresigned to his lot, and traced on his map the course of the Waikato\nacross the plains and valleys of the province. Lady Helena and Mary\nGrant, suppressing their terror, conversed in low tones with Glenarvan,\nand the most skillful physiognomist could not have detected on their\nfaces the anxiety of their hearts. The Waikato River is worshiped by the natives, as Paganel knew, and\nEnglish and German naturalists have never ascended beyond its junction\nwith the Waipa. Whither did Kai-Koumou intend to take his captives? The geographer could not have guessed if the word \"Taupo,\" frequently\nrepeated, had not attracted his attention. By consulting his map,\nhe saw that this name was applied to a celebrated lake in the most\nmountainous part of the island, and that from it the Waikato flows. Paganel, addressing Captain Mangles in French, so as not to be\nunderstood by the savages, asked him how fast the canoe was going.

The Duncan now and then gave a fearful lurch; her\nstanchions cracked, and sometimes the yards of the mainmast struck the\ncrests of the waves. At one moment the crew thought the yacht would\nnot rise again. Already the sailors, hatchet in hand, were rushing\nto cut away the fore-shrouds, when they were violently torn from\ntheir fastenings by the blast. The ship righted herself, but, without\nsupport on the waves, she was tossed about so terribly that the masts\nthreatened to break at their very foundations. She could not long\nendure such rolling; she was growing weak, and soon her shattered sides\nand opening seams must give way for the water. [Illustration: Then, impelled by the hurricane, the billows outran\nher; they leaped over the taffrail, and the whole deck was swept with\ntremendous violence.] [Sidenote: NEARING THE END.] Captain Mangles had but one resource,--to rig a storm-jib. He succeeded\nafter several hours' labor, but it was not until three o'clock in the\nafternoon that the jib was hauled to the main-stay and set to the\nwind. With this piece of canvas the Duncan flew before the wind\nwith inconceivable rapidity. It was necessary to keep up the greatest\npossible speed, for upon this alone depended her safety. Sometimes,\noutstripping the waves, she cut them with her slender prow and plunged\nbeneath them, like an enormous sea-monster, while the water swept\nher deck from stem to stern. At other times her swiftness barely\nequaled that of the surges, her rudder lost all power, and she gave\nterrific lurches that threatened to capsize her. Then, impelled by the\nhurricane, the billows outran her; they leaped over the taffrail, and\nthe whole deck was swept with tremendous violence. The situation was indeed alarming. The captain would not leave his\npost for an instant. He was tortured by fears that his impassive face\nwould not betray, and persistently sought to penetrate with his gaze\nthe gathering gloom. And he had good cause for fear. The Duncan, driven\nout of her course, was running towards the Australian coast with a\nswiftness that nothing could arrest. He felt, too, as if by instinct,\nthat a strong current was drawing him along. At every moment he feared\nthe shock of a reef upon which the yacht would be dashed into a\nthousand pieces, and he calculated that the shore was not more than a\ndozen miles to leeward. Finally he went in search of Lord Glenarvan, consulted with him in\nprivate, explained their actual situation, viewed it with the coolness\nof a sailor who is ready for any emergency, and ended by saying that he\nshould be obliged perhaps to run the Duncan ashore. \"To save those she carries, if possible, my lord,\" he added. \"Very well, captain,\" replied Glenarvan. \"And Lady Helena and Miss Grant?\" \"I will inform them only at the last moment, when all hope is gone of\nkeeping at sea. You will tell me.\" \"I will, my lord.\" Glenarvan returned to the ladies, who, without knowing all the danger,\nfelt it to be imminent.

A chief,\nequal in rank to Kai-Koumou, advanced with measured pace, and, rubbing\nhis nose against that of the latter, saluted him cordially. The\nprisoners were stationed in the centre of the encampment, and guarded\nwith extreme vigilance. The next morning the ascent of the Waikato was resumed. Other boats\ncame from various affluents of the river. Sixty warriors, evidently\nfugitives from the last insurrection, had now assembled, and were\nreturning, more or less wounded in the fray, to the mountain districts. Sometimes a song arose from the canoes, as they advanced in single\nfile. One native struck up the patriotic ode of the mysterious \"Pihé,\"\nthe national hymn that calls the Maoris to battle. The full and\nsonorous voice of the singer waked the echoes of the mountains; and\nafter each stanza his comrades struck their breasts, and sang the\nwarlike verses in chorus. Then they seized their oars again, and the\ncanoes were headed up stream. During the day a singular sight enlivened the voyage. About four\no'clock the canoe, without lessening its speed, guided by the steady\nhand of the chief, dashed through a narrow gorge. Eddies broke\nviolently against numerous small islands, which rendered navigation\nexceeding dangerous. Never could it be more hazardous to capsize, for\nthe banks afforded no refuge, and whoever had set foot on the porous\ncrust of the shore would probably have perished. At this point the\nriver flowed between warm springs, oxide of iron colored the muddy\nground a brilliant red, and not a yard of firm earth could be seen. The air was heavy with a penetrating sulphureous odor. The natives did\nnot regard it, but the captives were seriously annoyed by the noxious\nvapors exhaled from the fissures of the soil and the bubbles that\nburst and discharged their gaseous contents. Yet, however disagreeable\nthese emanations were, the eye could not but admire this magnificent\nspectacle. [Illustration: At this point the river flowed between warm springs, and\nnot a yard of firm earth could be seen.] The canoes soon after entered a dense cloud of white smoke, whose\nwreaths rose in gradually decreasing circles above the river. On the\nshores a hundred geysers, some shooting forth masses of vapor, and\nothers overflowing in liquid columns, varied their effects, like the\njets and cascades of a fountain. It seemed as though some engineer was\ndirecting at his pleasure the outflowings of these springs, as the\nwaters and vapor, mingling in the air, formed rainbows in the sunbeams. For two miles the canoes glided within this vapory atmosphere,\nenveloped in its warm waves that rolled along the surface of the water. Then the sulphureous smoke disappeared, and a pure swift current of\nfresh air refreshed the panting voyagers. The region of the springs was\npassed. Before the close of the day two more rapids were ascended, and\nat evening Kai-Koumou encamped a hundred miles above the junction of\nthe two streams. The river now turned towards the east, and then again\nflowed southward into Lake Taupo. The next morning Jacques Paganel consulted his map and discovered\non the right bank Mount Taubara, which rises to the height of three\nthousand feet. At noon the whole fleet of boats entered Lake Taupo, and\nthe natives hailed with frantic gestures a shred of cloth that waved in\nthe wind from the roof of a hut. It was the national flag.

Kai-Koumou, according to a custom quite ordinary in New Zealand, joined\nthe rank of priest to that of chief, and could, therefore, extend to\npersons or objects the superstitious protection of the taboo. The taboo, which is common to the tribes of Polynesia, has the power\nto prohibit at once all connection with the object or person tabooed. According to the Maori religion, whoever should lay his sacrilegious\nhand on what is declared taboo would be punished with death by the\noffended god; and in case the divinity should delay to avenge his own\ninsult, the priests would not fail to excite his anger. As for the prisoners confined in the temple, the taboo had rescued\nthem from the fury of the tribe. Some of the natives, the friends and\npartisans of Kai-Koumou, had stopped suddenly at the command of their\nchief, and had protected the captives. [Sidenote: THE TORTURES OF SUSPENSE.] Glenarvan, however, was not blind to the fate that was reserved for\nhim. Only his death could atone for the murder of a chief. Among savage\nraces death is always preceded by a protracted torture. He therefore\nexpected to cruelly expiate the righteous indignation that had nerved\nhis arm, but hoped that Kai-Koumou's rage would fall only on himself. What a night he and his companions passed! Who could depict their\nanguish, or measure their sufferings? Neither poor Robert nor brave\nPaganel had reappeared. But how could they doubt their fate? Were they\nnot the first victims of the natives' vengeance? All hope had vanished\neven from the heart of the major, who did not easily despair. John\nMangles felt himself growing mad at sight of the sad dejection of Mary\nGrant, thus separated from her brother. Glenarvan thought of that\nterrible request of Lady Helena, who, rather than yield to torture or\nslavery, preferred to die by his hand. Could he summon this fearful\ncourage? As for an escape, that was plainly impossible. Ten warriors,\narmed to the teeth, guarded the entrance of the temple. Morning came at last. There had been no communication between the\nnatives and the prisoners. The hut contained a considerable quantity\nof food, which the unfortunates scarcely touched. Hunger gave place to\ngrief. The day passed without bringing a change or a hope. Doubtless\nthe hour for the dead chief's funeral and their torture would be the\nsame. However, although Glenarvan concluded that Kai-Koumou must have\nabandoned all idea of exchange, the major on this point retained a\ngleam of hope. \"Who knows,\" said he, reminding Glenarvan of the effect produced upon\nthe chief by the death of Kara-Tété,--\"who knows but that Kai-Koumou in\nreality feels obliged to you?\" But, in spite of these observations, Glenarvan would no longer hope. The next day also passed away without the preparations for torture\nbeing made. The reason of the delay was this. The Maoris believe that the soul, for three days after death, inhabits\nthe body of the deceased, and therefore during this time the corpse\nremains unburied. This custom was rigorously observed, and for two days\nthe pah was deserted. Captain Mangles frequently stood on Wilson's\nshoulders and surveyed the fortification.

The Maoris for some time had been moving to and fro at the\nfoot of the peak without wandering from their post of observation. Furious cries saluted the appearance of the Europeans as they issued\nfrom the desecrated tomb. Each cast a longing glance towards the surrounding mountains, the deep\nvalleys, still veiled in mist, and the surface of Lake Taupo, gently\nrippling beneath the morning wind. Then all, eager to know Paganel's\nnew project, gathered around him with questioning looks; while the\ngeographer at once satisfied the restless curiosity of his companions. \"My friends,\" said he, \"my project has this advantage, that if it does\nnot produce the result that I expect, or even fails, our situation will\nnot be impaired. But it ought to and will succeed.\" \"And this project?\" asked the major. \"This is it,\" replied Paganel. \"The superstition of the natives has\nmade this mountain a place of refuge, and this superstition must help\nus to escape. If I succeed in convincing Kai-Koumou that we have become\nthe victims of our sacrilege, that the wrath of Heaven has fallen upon\nus, in short, that we have met a terrible death, do you think that he\nwill abandon the mountain and return to his village?\" \"Probably,\" said Glenarvan. \"And with what horrible death do you threaten us?\" inquired Lady Helena. \"The death of the sacrilegious, my friends,\" continued Paganel. \"The\navenging flames are under our feet. Let us open a way for them.\" \"What! you would make a volcano?\" cried Captain Mangles. \"Yes, a factitious, an improvised one, whose fury we will control. There is quite a supply of vapors and subterranean fires that only\nask for an outlet. Let us arrange an artificial eruption for our own\nadvantage.\" \"The idea is good,\" said the major, \"and well conceived, Paganel.\" \"You understand,\" resumed the geographer, \"that we are to feign being\nconsumed by the flames of Pluto, and shall disappear spiritually in the\ntomb of Kara-Tété.\" [Sidenote: A VOLCANO IN MINIATURE.] \"Where we shall remain three, four, or five days, if necessary, till\nthe savages are convinced of our death, and abandon the siege.\" \"But if they think of making sure of our destruction,\" said Miss Grant,\n\"and climb the mountain?\" \"No, my dear Mary,\" replied Paganel, \"they will not do that. The\nmountain is tabooed, and if it shall itself devour its profaners the\ntaboo will be still more rigorous.\" \"This plan is really well conceived,\" remarked Glenarvan. \"There is\nonly one chance against it, and that is, that the savages may persist\nin remaining at the foot of the mountain till the provisions fail\nus. But this is scarcely probable, especially if we play our part\nskillfully.\" \"And when shall we make this last venture?\" asked Lady Helena. \"This very evening,\" answered Paganel, \"at the hour of the greatest\ndarkness.\" \"Agreed,\" said MacNabb. \"Paganel, you are a man of genius; and although\nfrom habit I am scarcely ever enthusiastic, I will answer for your\nsuccess. Ha! these rascals! we shall perform a little miracle for them\nthat will delay their conversion a good century. May the missionaries\npardon us!\" Paganel's plan was therefore adopted, and really, with the\nsuperstitious notions of the Maoris, it might and ought to succeed. It only remained to execute it.

This terrible catastrophe had come upon Glenarvan just as he was\nabout reaching the long-desired harbor of Auckland, whence he would\nhave returned to his native country. Yet, looking at his calm and\npassionless countenance, you could not have divined the depth of his\nanguish, for in his present critical situation he did not betray the\nextent of his misfortunes. He felt that he ought to set an example of\nfortitude to his wife and his companions, as being the husband and\nchief. Moreover, he was ready to die first for the common safety, if\ncircumstances should require it. [Sidenote: CHIEFS, CIVILIZED AND UNCIVILIZED.] His companions were worthy of him; they shared his noble thoughts, and\ntheir calm and haughty appearance would scarcely have intimated that\nthey were being carried away to captivity and suffering. By common\nconsent, at Glenarvan's suggestion, they had resolved to feign a proud\nindifference in the presence of the savages. It was the only way of\ninfluencing those fierce natures. [Illustration: A boat might have been seen ascending the Waikato. It\nwas a canoe seventy feet long and five broad.] Since leaving the encampment, the natives, taciturn like all savages,\nhad scarcely spoken to each other. However, from a few words exchanged,\nGlenarvan perceived that they were acquainted with the English\nlanguage. He therefore resolved to question the chief in regard to the\nfate that was in store for them. Addressing Kai-Koumou, he said, in a\nfearless tone:\n\n\"Where are you taking us, chief?\" Kai-Koumou gazed at him coldly without answering. \"Say, what do you expect to do with us?\" continued Glenarvan. The chief's eyes blazed with a sudden light, and in a stern voice he\nreplied:\n\n\"To exchange you, if your friends will ransom you; to kill you, if they\nrefuse.\" Glenarvan asked no more, but hope returned to his heart. Doubtless,\nsome chiefs of the Maori tribe had fallen into the hands of the\nEnglish, and the natives would attempt to recover them by way of\nexchange; their situation, therefore, was not one for despair. Meantime the canoe rapidly ascended the river. Paganel, whose\nchangeable disposition carried him from one extreme to another, had\nregained his hopefulness. He believed that the Maoris were sparing them\nthe fatigue of their journey to the English settlements, and that they\nwere certain to arrive at their destination. He was, therefore, quite\nresigned to his lot, and traced on his map the course of the Waikato\nacross the plains and valleys of the province. Lady Helena and Mary\nGrant, suppressing their terror, conversed in low tones with Glenarvan,\nand the most skillful physiognomist could not have detected on their\nfaces the anxiety of their hearts. The Waikato River is worshiped by the natives, as Paganel knew, and\nEnglish and German naturalists have never ascended beyond its junction\nwith the Waipa. Whither did Kai-Koumou intend to take his captives? The geographer could not have guessed if the word \"Taupo,\" frequently\nrepeated, had not attracted his attention. By consulting his map,\nhe saw that this name was applied to a celebrated lake in the most\nmountainous part of the island, and that from it the Waikato flows. Paganel, addressing Captain Mangles in French, so as not to be\nunderstood by the savages, asked him how fast the canoe was going.

They mourned the dead in plaintive and modulated cadences. His\nrelations struck their heads together; his kinswomen lacerated their\nfaces with their nails, and showed themselves more lavish of blood than\nof tears. These unfortunate females conscientiously fulfilled their\nbarbarous duty. But these demonstrations were not enough to appease the soul of the\ndeceased, whose wrath would doubtless have smitten the survivors of his\ntribe; and his warriors, as they could not recall him to life, wished\nthat he should have no cause to regret in the other world the happiness\nof this. Kara-Tété's wife was not to forsake her husband in the tomb. Moreover,\nthe unfortunate woman would not have been allowed to survive him;\nit was the custom, in accordance with duty, and examples of such\nsacrifices are not wanting in New Zealand history. The woman appeared. She was still young. Her hair floated in disorder over her shoulders. Vague words, lamentations, and broken phrases, in which she celebrated\nthe virtues of the dead, interrupted her groans; and, in a final\nparoxysm of grief, she stretched herself at the foot of the mound,\nbeating the ground with her head. At this moment Kai-Koumou approached her. Suddenly the unfortunate\nvictim rose; but a violent blow with the \"méré,\" a formidable club,\nwielded by the hand of the chief, struck her lifeless to the earth. [Sidenote: POOR HUMANITY!] Frightful cries at once broke forth. A hundred arms threatened the\ncaptives, who trembled at the horrible sight. But no one stirred, for\nthe funeral ceremonies were not ended. Kara-Tété's wife had joined her husband in the other world. Both bodies\nlay side by side. But for the eternal life his faithful spouse could\nnot alone suffice the deceased. Who would serve them in presence of\nNouï-Atoua, if their slaves did not follow them? Six unfortunates were brought before the corpse of their master and\nmistress. They were servants, whom the pitiless laws of war had reduced\nto slavery. During the life of the chief they had undergone the\nseverest privations, suffered a thousand abuses, had been scantily fed,\nand compelled constantly to labor like beasts; and now, according to\nthe Maori belief, they were to continue their existence of servitude\nfor eternity. They appeared to be resigned to their fate, and were not astonished\nat a sacrifice they had long anticipated. Their freedom from all\nbonds showed that they would meet death unresistingly. Moreover, this\ndeath was rapid, protracted sufferings were spared them. These were\nreserved for the captives who stood trembling not twenty paces distant. Six blows of the méré, given by six stalwart warriors, stretched the\nvictims on the ground in a pool of blood. It was the signal for a\nterrible scene of cannibalism, which followed in all its horrible\ndetails. Glenarvan and his companions, breathless with fright, strove to hide\nthis awful scene from the eyes of the two unhappy ladies. They now\nunderstood what awaited them at sunrise the next day, and what cruel\ntortures would doubtless precede such a death. They were dumb with\nhorror. The funeral dance now began.

His name was Kara-Tété, which means in the native language\n\"The Irascible.\" Kai-Koumou treated him with some respect, and from\nthe delicacy of his tattooing it was evident that he occupied a high\nrank in his tribe. An observer, however, would have detected a rivalry\nbetween the two chiefs. The major, indeed, perceived that Kara-Tété's\ninfluence surpassed that of Kai-Koumou. They both ruled the powerful\ntribes of the Waikato with equal rank; and, during this interview,\nalthough Kai-Koumou smiled, his eyes betrayed a deep hostility. He now questioned Glenarvan. \"You are English?\" said he. \"Yes,\" replied Glenarvan, without hesitation, for this nationality\nwould probably facilitate an exchange.

But here a serious\ndisappointment awaited them,--the lake was dry! CHAPTER XVIII. IN SEARCH OF WATER. Lake Salinas terminates the cluster of lagoons that adjoin the Ventana\nand Guamini mountains. Numerous expeditions are made to this place\nto obtain supplies of salt, with which these waters are strongly\nimpregnated. But now the water had evaporated under the heat of the\nsun, and the lake was only a vast glittering basin. When Thalcave announced the presence of a drinkable liquid at Lake\nSalinas, he meant the streams of fresh water that flow from it in\nmany places. But at this time its affluents were as dry as itself. The burning sun had absorbed everything. Hence, the consternation was\ngeneral when the thirsty party arrived at the parched shores of Lake\nSalinas. It was necessary to take counsel. The little water in the leathern\nbottles was half spoiled, and could not quench their thirst, which\nbegan to make itself acutely felt. Hunger and fatigue gave place to\nthis imperative want. A \"roukah,\" a kind of upright tent, of leather,\nwhich stood in a hollow, and had been abandoned by the natives, served\nas a refuge for the travelers, while their horses, stretched on the\nmuddy shores of the lake, ate the saline plants and dry reeds, although\nreluctantly. When each had sat down in the roukah, Paganel asked Thalcave's advice\nas to what was best to be done. A rapid conversation, of which\nGlenarvan caught a few words, ensued between the geographer and the\nIndian. Thalcave spoke calmly, while Paganel gesticulated for both.", "similarity": 0.49578940868377686}, {"chunk_id": 180, "text": "However, he was not deterred from rehearsing how one and\nanother not merely visited, but began to settle, on the island, so that\nin the treaty of 1814 it was formally recognized as belonging to Great\nBritain, and twenty years after was important enough to have a separate\nofficial and governmental establishment. Paganel also told, at great length, the tales of many of the sad\nincidents which from time to time have marked even the commercial\nintercourse between the European and the Maori; as, for instance, the\nsad tale of conflict and bloodshed connected with the death of Captain\nMarion, a French navigator, in 1772. He had landed near the spot where\nSurville had ill-treated some of the natives and traitorously seized\na son of the chief, Takouri, who yet appeared to welcome this next\nFrench visitant, though remembering none the less the terrible duty of\nvengeance which is felt by the Maori to be so binding. [Illustration: It was on the sixth of October, 1769, that this\nnavigator (Captain Cook) first landed on the shores.] For a long time the cloak of friendship was worn by the natives, the\nmore thoroughly to lull the suspicions of the whites, and to entice a\nlarger number on shore; in which endeavor they succeeded only too well. The French ships being greatly out of repair, Marion was induced to\nfell timber at some distance in the interior, and to establish in this\noccupation a great number of his men, going frequently to them, and\nremaining with them and the apparently friendly chiefs. On one of these\noccasions the Maoris fulfilled their revengeful project with a terrible\nsatisfaction to themselves. Only one man, of all those in the interior,\nmanaged to escape, the commander himself falling a prey to their\nvengeance. They then endeavored to kill the second in command, who,\nwith several others, was nearer to the shore. These, of course, at once\nstarted for their boats; breathless, they reached them, hotly pursued\nto the water's edge by the insatiate savages. Then, safe themselves,\nthe French marksmen picked off the chief, and the previous exultation\nof the aborigines was, even in the hour of their triumph, turned to\nlamentation, coupled with wonder at the terrible power of the white\nman's fire-barrel.

Paganel had foreseen these difficulties, but he expected to act\nprudently, and not to venture to extremes. An illusion was enough to\ndeceive the Maoris, without the awful reality of a large eruption. How long that day seemed! Each one counted the interminable hours. Everything was prepared for flight. The provisions of the tomb had\nbeen divided, and made into convenient bundles. Several mats, and the\nfire-arms, which had been found in the tomb of the chief, formed light\nbaggage.

Rapidity was necessary, and Glenarvan, Paganel, MacNabb, Robert,\nthe steward, and the two sailors at once set to work vigorously. The place for the crater was chosen thirty paces from Kara-Tété's tomb. It was important that this structure should be spared by the eruption,\nfor otherwise the taboo would become ineffective. Paganel had observed\nan enormous block of stone, around which the vapors seemed to pour\nforth with considerable force. This rocky mass covered a small natural\ncrater in the peak, and only by its weight prevented the escape of the\nsubterranean flames. If they could succeed in overturning it, the smoke\nand lava would immediately issue through the unobstructed opening. [Sidenote: VULCANS AT WORK.] The fugitives made themselves levers out of the stakes of the tomb, and\nwith these they vigorously attacked the ponderous mass. Under their\nunited efforts the rock was not long in moving. They dug a sort of\ngroove for it down the side of the mountain, that it might slide on an\ninclined plane. As their action increased, the trembling of the earth became more\nviolent. Hollow rumblings and hissings sounded under the thin\ncrust. But the bold experimenters, like real Vulcans, governing the\nunderground fires, worked on in silence. Several cracks and a few gusts\nof hot smoke warned them that their position was becoming dangerous. But a final effort detached the block, which glided down the slope of\nthe mountain and disappeared. The thin covering at once yielded. An incandescent column poured forth\ntowards the sky with loud explosions, while streams of boiling water\nand lava rolled towards the encampment of the natives and the valleys\nbelow. The whole peak trembled, and you might almost have thought that\nit was disappearing in a general conflagration.

They approached within a\nhundred paces, so that they could be easily distinguished. Their high\nforeheads, prominent rather than receding, their tall forms, and their\nolive color, showed them to be magnificent types of the Indian race. They were clad in the skins of guanacos, and carried various weapons of\nwar and the chase, while their dexterity in horsemanship was remarkable. [Illustration]\n\nHaving halted, they appeared to hold a conference, crying and\ngesticulating. Glenarvan advanced toward them; but he had not proceeded\ntwo yards, when the detachment wheeled about and disappeared with\nincredible swiftness. The tired horses of the travelers could never\nhave overtaken them. \"The cowards!\" cried Paganel. \"They fly too fast for honest men,\" said MacNabb. \"What are these Indians?\" inquired Paganel of Thalcave. \"Gauchos!\" replied the Patagonian. \"Gauchos!\" repeated Paganel, turning toward his companions, \"Gauchos! We had no need, then, to take such precautions. There was nothing to\nfear!\" \"Why?\" asked the major. \"Because the Gauchos are inoffensive peasants.\" \"Do you think so, Paganel?\" \"Certainly. They took us for robbers, and fled.\" Glenarvan was quite disappointed in not speaking with them, as he\nexpected to obtain additional tidings of the lost sailors; but it\nwas necessary to push on, if they would reach their destination that\nevening. At eight o'clock Thalcave, who had gone a little in advance, announced\nthat the lake so long desired was in sight. A quarter of an hour\nafterward the little party descended the high banks. But here a serious\ndisappointment awaited them,--the lake was dry! CHAPTER XVIII. IN SEARCH OF WATER. Lake Salinas terminates the cluster of lagoons that adjoin the Ventana\nand Guamini mountains. Numerous expeditions are made to this place\nto obtain supplies of salt, with which these waters are strongly\nimpregnated. But now the water had evaporated under the heat of the\nsun, and the lake was only a vast glittering basin. When Thalcave announced the presence of a drinkable liquid at Lake\nSalinas, he meant the streams of fresh water that flow from it in\nmany places. But at this time its affluents were as dry as itself. The burning sun had absorbed everything. Hence, the consternation was\ngeneral when the thirsty party arrived at the parched shores of Lake\nSalinas. It was necessary to take counsel. The little water in the leathern\nbottles was half spoiled, and could not quench their thirst, which\nbegan to make itself acutely felt. Hunger and fatigue gave place to\nthis imperative want. A \"roukah,\" a kind of upright tent, of leather,\nwhich stood in a hollow, and had been abandoned by the natives, served\nas a refuge for the travelers, while their horses, stretched on the\nmuddy shores of the lake, ate the saline plants and dry reeds, although\nreluctantly. When each had sat down in the roukah, Paganel asked Thalcave's advice\nas to what was best to be done. A rapid conversation, of which\nGlenarvan caught a few words, ensued between the geographer and the\nIndian. Thalcave spoke calmly, while Paganel gesticulated for both.", "similarity": 0.4379828870296478}, {"chunk_id": 217, "text": "\"And what passage of the Scriptures have these natives fired at us?\" asked Glenarvan. \"A mighty promise of God,\" replied Captain Mangles, who had also read\nthe paper. \"It bids us hope in Him,\" added the young captain, with the\nunshaken conviction of his Scottish faith. \"Read, John,\" said Glenarvan. He read this line, which had so strangely reached them:\n\n\"Because he hath set his love upon Me, therefore will I deliver him:\"\nPsalm xci. I. \"My friends,\" said Glenarvan, \"we must make known the words of hope to\nour brave and dear ladies. Here is something to reanimate their hearts.\" Glenarvan and his companions ascended the steep paths of the peak, and\nproceeded towards the tomb, which they wished to examine. On the way\nthey were astonished to feel, at short intervals, a certain trembling\nof the ground. It was not an irregular agitation, but that continued\nvibration which the sides of a boiler undergo when it is fully charged. Steam, in large quantities, generated by the action of subterranean\nfires, seemed to be working beneath the crust of the mountain. This peculiarity could not astonish people who had passed between the\nwarm springs of the Waikato. They knew that this region of Ika-Na-Maoui\nis volcanic. It is like a sieve, from the holes of which ever issue the\nvapors of subterranean laboratories. Paganel, who had already observed this, called the attention of his\nfriends to the circumstance. The Maunganamu is only one of those\nnumerous cones that cover the central portion of the island. The least\nmechanical action could provoke the formation of a crater in the clayey\nsoil. \"And yet,\" said Glenarvan, \"we seem to be in no more danger here than\nbeside the boiler of the Duncan. This crust is firm.\" \"Certainly,\" replied the major; \"but a boiler, however strong it may\nbe, will always burst at last after too long use.\" \"MacNabb,\" said Paganel, \"I do not desire to remain on this peak. Let\nHeaven show me a way of escape, and I will leave it instantly.\" Lady Helena, who perceived Lord Glenarvan, now approached. \"My dear Edward,\" said she, \"you have considered our position! Are we\nto hope or fear?\" \"Hope, my dear Helena,\" replied Glenarvan. \"The natives will never come\nto the top of the mountain, and we shall have abundant time to form a\nplan of escape.\" \"Moreover, madam,\" said Captain Mangles, \"God himself encourages us to\nhope.\" So saying, he gave her the text of the Bible which had been sent to\nthem. She and Mary Grant, whose confiding soul was always open to\nthe ministrations of Heaven, saw, in the words of the Holy Book, an\ninfallible pledge of safety. \"Now to the tomb!\" cried Paganel, gayly. \"This is our fortress, our\ncastle, our dining-room, and our workshop. No one is to disarrange it. Ladies, permit me to do the honors of this charming dwelling.\" All followed the good-natured Paganel. When the savages saw the\nfugitives desecrate anew this tabooed sepulchre, they fired numerous\nvolleys, and uttered yells no less terrible. But fortunately their\nbullets could not reach as far as their cries, for they only came\nhalf-way, while their vociferations were lost in empty air. [Sidenote: BOARD AND LODGING.] Lady Helena, Mary Grant, and their companions, quite reassured at\nseeing that the superstition of the Maoris was still stronger than\ntheir rage, entered the tomb.

The fire gradually subsided, for want\nof fuel; the flames sank; the plain, before illumined, now relapsed\ninto shadow, and in the shadow reappeared the terrible eyes of the red\nwolves. A few moments more, and the whole drove would rush into the\ninclosure. [Illustration]\n\nThalcave discharged his carbine for the last time, stretched out one\nmore of their enemies, and, as his ammunition was exhausted, folded\nhis arms. His head sank upon his breast; he appeared to be questioning\nhimself. Was he searching for some bold, novel, or rash scheme for\nrepelling this furious herd? Glenarvan did not venture to ask him. At this moment a change took place in the action of the wolves. They\nseemed to be retreating, and their howls, so deafening before, suddenly\nceased. An ominous silence reigned over the plain. \"They are going,\" said Robert. \"Perhaps,\" replied Glenarvan, who was listening with intentness. But Thalcave shook his head. He knew well that the animals would not\nabandon a certain prey until at daybreak they returned to their holes\nand dens. However, the tactics of their enemies had evidently changed, they no\nlonger endeavored to force the entrance of the ramada; but their new\nmanoeuvres were already causing a still more imminent danger. The wolves, abandoning their design of penetrating the inclosure by\nthis entrance, which was defended by weapon and fire, went to the\nback of the ramada and sought to assail it in the rear. Their claws\nwere soon heard rattling against the half-decayed wood. Already their\npowerful paws and bloody mouths had forced their way between the\nshattered stakes. The horses, bewildered and panic-stricken, broke\ntheir halters and dashed into the inclosure. Glenarvan seized Robert\nin his arms, to defend him to the last extremity; and he would have\nattempted a rash flight, and rushed out of the ramada, had not his eyes\nfallen upon the Indian. Thalcave, turning like a deer, had suddenly approached his horse,\nwhich was neighing with impatience, and was beginning to saddle him\ncarefully, forgetting neither strap nor buckle. He seemed no longer to\ncare for the howls, that were now redoubled. Glenarvan gazed at him\nwith a dark foreboding. \"He is leaving us!\" cried he, seeing Thalcave gather up his reins as\nthough he were about to mount. \"He? never!\" said Robert. In truth the Indian was about to make a venture, not to leave his\nfriends, but to save them by sacrificing himself. Thaouka was ready. He champed his bit; he pranced; his eyes, full of a fiery spirit, shot\nforth lightning flashes; he understood his master. Just as the Indian was seizing the mane of his horse, Glenarvan caught\nhim by the arm with a convulsive grasp. \"You are going?\" said he, pointing to the plain, which was now deserted. \"Yes,\" replied the Indian, who comprehended the gesture of his\ncompanion; and, with vehement gesticulations which were however\nperfectly intelligible, he added a few words in Spanish, which\nsignified: \"Thaouka--good horse--swift--will draw the wolves after him.\" [Illustration: Frightful howls resounded.

Several faces, carved at the ends of the rafters,\nadorned the hut, and the curtain was covered with various imitations\nof foliage, symbolical figures, monsters, and graceful sculpturing,\na curious piece of work, fashioned by the scissors of the native\ndecorators.

The smoke, when it became sufficiently thick, perforce escaped at this\noutlet, but it of course blackened the walls of the house. On one side of the hut were storehouses, containing the chief's\nprovisions, his harvest of flax, potatoes, and edible ferns, and\nthe ovens where the various articles of food were cooked by contact\nwith heated stones. Farther off, in small pens, pigs and goats were\nconfined, and dogs ran about seeking their scanty sustenance. They were\nrather poorly kept, for animals that formed the Maori daily food. Glenarvan and his companions had taken in the whole at a glance. They\nawaited beside an empty hut the good pleasure of the chief, exposed to\nthe insults of a crowd of old women, who surrounded them like harpies,\nand threatened them with their fists, crying and howling. Several\nEnglish words that passed their lips clearly indicated that they were\ndemanding immediate vengeance. In the midst of these cries and threats, Lady Helena affected a\ncalmness that she could not feel in her heart. This courageous woman,\nin order that her husband's coolness might not forsake him, heroically\ncontrolled her emotions. Poor Mary Grant felt herself growing weak, and\nCaptain Mangles supported her, ready to die in her defence.

It is a good idea of these savages to\ncarry their weapons to heaven with them.\" \"But these are English guns!\" said the major. \"Doubtless,\" replied Glenarvan; \"it is a very foolish custom to make\npresents of fire-arms to the savages, who then use them against the\ninvaders, and with reason.

The amount of food testified their esteem for the virtues\nof the chief. There were provisions enough to last ten persons fifteen\ndays, or rather the deceased for eternity. They consisted of ferns,\nsweet yams, and potatoes, which were introduced some time before by the\nEuropeans. Tall vases of fresh water stood near, and a dozen baskets,\nartistically woven, contained numerous tablets of green gum. The fugitives were, therefore, fortified for several days against\nhunger and thirst, and they needed no urging to take their first meal\nat the chief's expense. Glenarvan directed Mr. Olbinett's attention\nto the food necessary for his companions; but he, with his usual\nexactness, even in critical situations, thought the bill of fare rather\nscanty. Moreover, he did not know how to prepare the roots, and there\nwas no fire. But Paganel solved the difficulty, and advised him to simply bury his\nferns and potatoes in the ground itself, for the heat of the upper\nstrata was very great.

Three\nweeks after her departure, a terrible tempest disabled her. It became\nnecessary to cut away the masts. A leak was discovered in the hold,\nwhich they did not succeed in stopping. The crew were soon overtasked\nand exhausted. The pumps could not be worked. For eight days the\nvessel was at the mercy of the storm.

No. If any prisoner had fallen into the\nhands of the Indians on the Atlantic coast, Sergeant Manuel would\ncertainly have been informed.

As the city was on the thirty-seventh parallel,\nthe Macquarie had been carried a considerable distance out of her\ncourse. It was, therefore, necessary to sail northward to reach the\ncapital of New Zealand. \"A journey of not more than twenty-five miles,\" said Glenarvan. \"It is\nnothing.\" \"What is nothing at sea will be long and difficult on land,\" replied\nPaganel. \"Well, then,\" said Captain Mangles, \"let us do all in our power to\nfloat the Macquarie.\" This question being settled, their labors were resumed. It was high\nwater, but they could not take advantage of it, since the anchors were\nnot yet moored. Yet the captain watched the ship with some anxiety. Would she float with the tide? This point would soon be decided. They waited. Several cracks were heard, caused either by a rising or\nstarting of the keel. Great reliance had been placed upon the tide, but\nthe brig did not stir. The work was continued, and the raft was soon ready. The small anchor\nwas put on board, and the captain and Wilson embarked, after mooring\na small cable at the stern. The ebb-tide made them drift, and they\ntherefore anchored, half a cable's length distant, in ten fathoms of\nwater. The bottom afforded a firm hold. [Sidenote: A MIDNIGHT CONCLAVE.] The great anchor now remained. They lowered it with difficulty,\ntransported it on the raft, and soon it was moored behind the other;\nthe captain and his men returning to the vessel, and waiting for high\nwater, which would be early in the morning.

After dinner, Captain Mangles took a final precaution to insure the\nsuccess of his experiment. He threw overboard a great part of the\nmerchandise to lighten the brig; but the remainder of the ballast, the\nheavy spars, the spare yards, and a few tons of pig-iron, were carried\nto the stern, to aid by their weight in liberating the keel. Wilson and\nMulready likewise rolled to the same place a number of casks filled\nwith water. Midnight arrived before these labors were completed.

The\nspectacles and telescope gave him a high opinion of Paganel, whom he\nattached carefully to his person, not only by his benefits, but by\nstrong flaxen ropes, especially at night. This novel situation lasted three long days. Was he well or badly\ntreated? Both, as he stated without further explanation. In short, he\nwas a prisoner, and, except for the prospect of immediate torture,\nhis condition did not seem more enviable than that of his unfortunate\nfriends. Fortunately, last night he succeeded in biting asunder his ropes and\nescaping. He had witnessed at a distance the burial of the chief,\nknew that he had been interred on the summit of Maunganamu mountain,\nand that it was tabooed in consequence. He therefore resolved to take\nrefuge there, not wishing to leave the place where his companions were\nheld captives. He succeeded in his undertaking, arrived at Kara-Tété's\ntomb, and waited in hope that Providence would in some way deliver his\nfriends. Such was Paganel's story. Did he omit designedly any circumstance\nof his stay among the natives? More than once his embarrassment led\nthem to suspect so. However that might be, he received unanimous\ncongratulations; and as the past was now known, they returned to the\npresent. Their situation was still exceedingly critical. The natives, if they\ndid not venture to climb the mountain, expected that hunger and thirst\nwould force their prisoners to surrender. It was only a matter of time,\nand the savages had great patience. Glenarvan did not disregard the\ndifficulties of his position, but waited for the favorable issue which\nProvidence seemed to promise. And first he wished to examine this improvised fortress; not to defend\nit, for an attack was not to be feared, but that he might find a way of\nescaping. The major and the captain, Robert, Paganel, and himself, took\nthe exact bearings of the mountain. They observed the direction of the\npaths, their branches and declivities. A ridge a mile in length united\nthe Maunganamu to the Wahiti range, and then declined to the plain. Its\nnarrow and winding summit presented the only practicable route, in case\nescape should become possible.

The bullets of the natives on the lower\nramparts of the pah might intercept them, and form a barrier that no\none could safely cross.

But was Jacques Paganel to die a bachelor? Certainly not; for, after\nhis heroic exploits, the worthy geographer could not escape celebrity. His eccentricities (and his abilities) made him much talked of in\nScotland. People seemed as though they could not show him enough\nattention. Just at this time an amiable lady of thirty, none other than the\nmajor's cousin, a little eccentric herself, but still agreeable and\ncharming, fell in love with the geographer's peculiarities. Paganel was\nfar from being insensible to Miss Arabella's attractions, yet did not\ndare to declare his sentiments. The major accordingly undertook the\npart of Cupid's messenger between these two congenial hearts, and even\ntold Paganel that marriage was \"the last blunder\" that he could commit. But the geographer was very much embarrassed, and, strangely enough,\ncould not summon courage to speak for himself. [Illustration: Early in the afternoon the travelers reached Malcolm\nCastle, amidst the hurrahs of their tenantry and friends.] \"Does not Miss Arabella please you?\" MacNabb would say to him. \"Oh, major, she is charming!\" cried Paganel,--\"a thousand times too\ncharming for me; and, if I must tell you, would please me better if she\nwere less so. I should like to find a defect.\" \"Be easy,\" answered the major; \"she has more than one. The most perfect\nwoman always has her share. Well, then, Paganel, are you decided?\" \"I do not dare.\" \"But, my learned friend, why do you hesitate?\" \"I am unworthy of her!\" was the geographer's invariable reply. At last, one day, driven desperate by the irrepressible major, Paganel\nconfessed to him, under the pledge of secrecy, a peculiarity that would\nfacilitate his identification, if the police should ever be on his\ntrack! \"Bah!\" exclaimed the major. \"It is as I tell you,\" persisted Paganel. \"What matter, my worthy friend?\" \"Is that your opinion?\" \"On the contrary, you are only more remarkable. This adds to your\npersonal advantages. It makes you the inimitable individual of whom\nArabella has dreamed.\" And the major, preserving an imperturbable gravity, left Paganel a prey\nto the most acute anxiety. A short interview took place between MacNabb and the lady, and fifteen\nweeks after a marriage was celebrated with great pomp in the chapel of\nMalcolm Castle. [Illustration: Fifteen weeks after a marriage was celebrated with great\npomp in the chapel of Malcolm Castle.] The geographer's secret would doubtless have remained forever\nburied in the abysses of the unknown if the major had not told it to\nGlenarvan, who did not conceal it from Lady Helena, who communicated\nit to Mrs. Mangles.

The chief, whose name was \"Hihy\" (sunbeam), was not a bad man. The\nspectacles and telescope gave him a high opinion of Paganel, whom he\nattached carefully to his person, not only by his benefits, but by\nstrong flaxen ropes, especially at night. This novel situation lasted three long days. Was he well or badly\ntreated? Both, as he stated without further explanation. In short, he\nwas a prisoner, and, except for the prospect of immediate torture,\nhis condition did not seem more enviable than that of his unfortunate\nfriends. Fortunately, last night he succeeded in biting asunder his ropes and\nescaping. He had witnessed at a distance the burial of the chief,\nknew that he had been interred on the summit of Maunganamu mountain,\nand that it was tabooed in consequence. He therefore resolved to take\nrefuge there, not wishing to leave the place where his companions were\nheld captives. He succeeded in his undertaking, arrived at Kara-Tété's\ntomb, and waited in hope that Providence would in some way deliver his\nfriends. Such was Paganel's story. Did he omit designedly any circumstance\nof his stay among the natives? More than once his embarrassment led\nthem to suspect so. However that might be, he received unanimous\ncongratulations; and as the past was now known, they returned to the\npresent. Their situation was still exceedingly critical. The natives, if they\ndid not venture to climb the mountain, expected that hunger and thirst\nwould force their prisoners to surrender. It was only a matter of time,\nand the savages had great patience. Glenarvan did not disregard the\ndifficulties of his position, but waited for the favorable issue which\nProvidence seemed to promise. And first he wished to examine this improvised fortress; not to defend\nit, for an attack was not to be feared, but that he might find a way of\nescaping. The major and the captain, Robert, Paganel, and himself, took\nthe exact bearings of the mountain. They observed the direction of the\npaths, their branches and declivities. A ridge a mile in length united\nthe Maunganamu to the Wahiti range, and then declined to the plain. Its\nnarrow and winding summit presented the only practicable route, in case\nescape should become possible. If the fugitives could pass this point\nunperceived, under cover of the night, perhaps they might succeed in\nreaching the deep valleys and outwitting the Maoris. But this course offered more than one danger, as they would have to\npass below within gun-shot. The bullets of the natives on the lower\nramparts of the pah might intercept them, and form a barrier that no\none could safely cross. Glenarvan and his friends, as soon as they ventured on the dangerous\npart of the ridge, were saluted with a volley of shots; but only a\nfew wads, borne by the wind, reached them. They were made of printed\npaper. Paganel picked them up out of curiosity, but it was difficult to\ndecipher them. [Sidenote: A STRANGE COLPORTEUR.] \"Why!\" said he, \"do you know, my friends, what these creatures use for\nwads in their guns?\" \"No,\" replied Glenarvan. \"Leaves of the Bible!

They will have difficulty in\nfounding Maori libraries.\" \"And what passage of the Scriptures have these natives fired at us?\" asked Glenarvan.", "similarity": 0.4466981291770935}, {"chunk_id": 75, "text": "He was by parentage a\nBasque, and his name was Manuel Ipharaguerre. A year after his arrival\nin the country, Sergeant Manuel was naturalized, joined the Argentine\narmy, and married an honest Indian woman, who had twins,--boys, to be\nsure, for the sergeant's worthy consort would never present him with\ndaughters. Manuel did not think of any other calling than that of the\nsoldier, and hoped, in time, with the help of God, to offer to the\nrepublic a whole battalion of young soldiers. \"You have seen them?\" said he. \"Charming fellows! Good soldiers! José! Juan! Miguel! Pepe! Pepe is only seven years old, and is already biting\nhis cartridge!\" Pepe, hearing himself complimented, joined his two little feet, and\npresented arms with perfect precision. \"He will do!\" added the sergeant. \"He will be a major--or\nbrigadier-general one day!\" This story lasted a quarter of an hour, to Thalcave's great\nastonishment. The Indian could not understand how so many words could\ncome from a single throat. No one interrupted the commander; and even\na French sergeant had to conclude at last, though not without forcing\nhis guests to accompany him to his dwelling. Here they were introduced\nto Madame Ipharaguerre, who appeared to be \"a good-looking person,\" if\nthis expression may be employed in regard to an Indian. When he had exhausted himself, the sergeant asked his guests to what he\nowed the honor of their visit. And now it was their turn to explain. Paganel, opening the conversation in French, told him of their journey\nacross the Pampas, and ended by asking why the Indians had abandoned\nthe country. \"War!\" replied the sergeant. \"War?\" \"Yes, civil war.\" \"Civil war?\" rejoined Paganel. \"Yes, war between Paraguay and Buenos Ayres,\" answered the sergeant. \"Well?\" \"Why, all the Indians of the north are in the rear of General Flores,\nand those of the plains are plundering.\" \"But the caziques?\" \"The caziques with them.\" This answer was reported to Thalcave, who shook his head. Indeed,\nhe either did not know, or had forgotten, that a civil war, which\nwas afterwards to involve Brazil, was decimating two-thirds of the\nrepublic. The Indians had everything to gain in these internal\nstruggles, and could not neglect such fine opportunities for plunder. The sergeant, therefore, was not mistaken in attributing this desertion\nof the Pampas to the civil war that was being waged in the northern\npart of the Argentine Provinces. But this event disconcerted Glenarvan's hopes. If Captain Grant was\na prisoner of the caziques, he must have been carried by them to the\nnorthern frontiers. Yet how and where to find him? Must they attempt\na perilous and almost useless search to the northern limits of the\nPampas? It was a serious matter, which was to be earnestly considered. However, one important question was still to be asked of the sergeant,\nand the major thought of this, while his companions were looking at\neach other in silence. \"Have you heard of any Europeans being retained as prisoners by the\ncaziques of the Pampas?\" Manuel reflected for a few moments, like a man who recalls events to\nrecollection. \"Yes,\" said he, at length. \"Ah!\" cried Glenarvan, conceiving a new hope. [Sidenote: REVELATIONS.] Paganel, MacNabb, Robert, and he now surrounded the sergeant. \"Speak, speak!\" cried they, gazing at him with eagerness even in their\nlooks. \"Several years ago,\" replied Manuel, \"yes,--that is it,--European\nprisoners--but have never seen them.\" \"Several years ago?\" said Glenarvan. \"You are mistaken.

Paganel also told, at great length, the tales of many of the sad\nincidents which from time to time have marked even the commercial\nintercourse between the European and the Maori; as, for instance, the\nsad tale of conflict and bloodshed connected with the death of Captain\nMarion, a French navigator, in 1772. He had landed near the spot where\nSurville had ill-treated some of the natives and traitorously seized\na son of the chief, Takouri, who yet appeared to welcome this next\nFrench visitant, though remembering none the less the terrible duty of\nvengeance which is felt by the Maori to be so binding. [Illustration: It was on the sixth of October, 1769, that this\nnavigator (Captain Cook) first landed on the shores.] For a long time the cloak of friendship was worn by the natives, the\nmore thoroughly to lull the suspicions of the whites, and to entice a\nlarger number on shore; in which endeavor they succeeded only too well. The French ships being greatly out of repair, Marion was induced to\nfell timber at some distance in the interior, and to establish in this\noccupation a great number of his men, going frequently to them, and\nremaining with them and the apparently friendly chiefs. On one of these\noccasions the Maoris fulfilled their revengeful project with a terrible\nsatisfaction to themselves. Only one man, of all those in the interior,\nmanaged to escape, the commander himself falling a prey to their\nvengeance. They then endeavored to kill the second in command, who,\nwith several others, was nearer to the shore. These, of course, at once\nstarted for their boats; breathless, they reached them, hotly pursued\nto the water's edge by the insatiate savages. Then, safe themselves,\nthe French marksmen picked off the chief, and the previous exultation\nof the aborigines was, even in the hour of their triumph, turned to\nlamentation, coupled with wonder at the terrible power of the white\nman's fire-barrel. [Illustration: Safe themselves, the French marksmen picked off the\nchief.] All this and much more did the geographer narrate; but it must be\nconfessed that he neither spoke, nor did they listen, with the\ncomplacency evinced in his previous tales. Besides, their surroundings\nwere at the time uncomfortable, and the first prognostications of a\nspeedy passage were not likely to be verified. Unfortunately, this painful voyage was prolonged. Six days after her\ndeparture, the Macquarie had not descried the shores of Auckland. The wind was fair, however, and still blew from the southwest; but\nnevertheless the brig did not make much headway. The sea was rough, the\nrigging creaked, the ribs cracked, and the vessel rode the waves with\ndifficulty. Fortunately, Will Halley, like a man who was in no hurry, did not crowd\non sail, or his masts would inevitably have snapped. Captain Mangles\nhoped, therefore, that this clumsy craft would reach its destination\nin safety; still, he was pained to see his companions on board in such\nmiserable quarters.

As soon as this word was translated, Thalcave was surrounded by the\nseven travelers, who gazed at him with questioning looks. Paganel,\nexcited and scarcely finding his words, resumed these interesting\ninterrogatories, while his eyes, fixed upon the grave Indian, strove\nto anticipate his reply before it issued from his lips. Every word the\nPatagonian said he repeated in English, so that his companions heard\nthe Indian speak, as it were, in their own language. \"And this prisoner?\" inquired Paganel. \"He was a stranger,\" replied Thalcave slowly; \"a European.\" \"You have seen him?\" \"No, but he is mentioned in the accounts of the Indians. He was a brave\nman.\" \"You understand, my friends,\" said Paganel; \"a courageous man!\" \"My father!\" cried Robert Grant. Then, addressing Paganel:\n\n\"How do you say 'It is my father,' in Spanish?\" he asked. \"_Es mio padre_,\" answered the geographer. Immediately Robert, taking Thalcave's hands, said in a sweet voice,--\n\n\"_Es mio padre!_\"\n\n\"_Suo padre!_\" replied the Patagonian, whose look brightened. He took the boy in his arms, lifted him from his horse, and gazed at\nhim with the most curious sympathy. His intelligent countenance became\nsuffused with a peaceful emotion. But Paganel had not finished his inquiries. Where was this prisoner? What was he doing? When had Thalcave heard of him? All these questions\nthronged his mind at once. He did not have to wait long for answers,\nbut learnt that the European was a slave of one of the Indian tribes\nthat scour the plains. \"But where was he last?\" asked Paganel. \"With the cazique Calfoucoura,\" answered Thalcave. \"On the line we have been following?\" \"Yes.\" \"And who is this cazique?\" \"The chief of the Poyuches Indians; a man with two tongues and two\nhearts.\" [Sidenote: A SCIENTIFIC BATH.] \"That is to say, false in word and in deed,\" said Paganel, after\ntranslating to his companions this beautiful metaphor of the Indian\nlanguage. \"And can we rescue our friend?\" he added. \"Perhaps so, if your friend is still in the hands of the Indians.\" \"And when did you hear of him?\" \"A long time ago, and, since then, the sun has brought back two summers\nto the sky.\" Glenarvan's joy could not be described. This answer coincided exactly\nwith the date of the document. But one question remained to be asked. \"You speak of a prisoner,\" said Paganel; \"but were there not three?\" \"I do not know,\" replied Thalcave. \"And you know nothing of their actual situation?\" \"Nothing.\" This last word ended the conversation. It was possible that the three\nprisoners had been separated a long time. But the substance of the\nPatagonian's information was that the Indians spoke of a European who\nhad fallen into their power. The date of his captivity, the place where\nhe must have been, everything, even to the Patagonian phrase used to\nexpress his courage, related evidently to Captain Harry Grant. Their progress was now somewhat slow and difficult; their next object\nbeing to reach and cross the river Colorado, to which at length\ntheir horses brought them. Here Paganel's first care was to bathe\n\"geographically\" in its waters, which are colored by a reddish clay.

Each looked to the geographer, who beat his brow in despair. \"Ah! I understand,\" said he, at last. \"All is clear, all is explained.\" \"But what is to be done?\" asked Glenarvan, with as much anxiety as\nimpatience. \"My friends,\" answered Paganel, taking Robert's hands, \"we must submit\nto a severe misfortune.

While thinking that we were on the track of Captain\nGrant, we have fallen upon that of young Guinnard.\" A profound silence followed this declaration. The mistake was palpable. The sergeant's story, the nationality of the prisoner, the murder\nof his companion, and his escape from the hands of the Indians, all\naccorded with the evident facts. Glenarvan gazed at Thalcave with a\nbewildered air. The Indian then resumed the conversation. \"Have you never heard of three English captives?\" he asked the sergeant. \"Never,\" replied Manuel. \"It would have been known at Tandil. I should\nhave heard of it. No, it cannot be.\" Glenarvan, after this formal response, had nothing more to do at Fort\nIndependence. He and his friends, therefore, departed, not without\nthanking the sergeant and shaking hands with him. Glenarvan was in despair at this complete overthrow of his hopes. Robert walked beside him in silence, with tearful eyes, while his\nprotector could not find a single word to console him. Paganel\ngesticulated and talked to himself. The major did not open his lips. As for Thalcave, his Indian pride seemed humbled at having gone astray\non a false trail. No one, however, thought of reproaching him for so\nexcusable an error. They returned to the encampment, saddened indeed. Still, not one of\nthe courageous and devoted men regretted so many hardships uselessly\nendured, so many dangers vainly incurred. But each saw all hope of\nsuccess annihilated in an instant. Could they find Captain Grant\nbetween Tandil and the sea? No. If any prisoner had fallen into the\nhands of the Indians on the Atlantic coast, Sergeant Manuel would\ncertainly have been informed. An event of such a nature could not\nhave escaped the natives who trade from Tandil to Carmen. Among the\ntraders of the Argentine Plains everything is known and reported. There\nwas therefore but one course now to take,--to join, without delay, the\nDuncan at Cape Medano, the appointed rendezvous.

Five minutes later all the fugitives, after their fortunate escape\nfrom the hut, left this temporary retreat, and, avoiding the inhabited\nshores of the lake, made their way by narrow paths farther down the\nmountain. They advanced rapidly, seeking to avoid all points where they\nmight be seen. They did not speak, but glided like shadows through the\nbushes. Where were they going? At random, it is true, but they were\nfree. About five o'clock day began to break. Purple tints colored the lofty\nbanks of clouds. The mountain peaks emerged from the mists of the\nmorning. The orb of day would not be long in appearing, and instead of\nbeing the signal for torture, was to betray the flight of the condemned. Before this dreaded moment arrived it was important that the fugitives\nshould be beyond the reach of the savages. But they could not advance\nquickly, for the paths were steep. Lady Helena scaled the declivities,\nsupported and even carried by Glenarvan, while Mary Grant leaned upon\nthe arm of her betrothed. Robert, happy and triumphant, whose heart was\nfull of joy at his success, took the lead, followed by the two sailors. For half an hour the fugitives wandered at a venture.

Moreover, a thick curtain of\nmist stretched at their feet, and prevented them from distinguishing\nthe valleys below. But the fugitives could not doubt that their escape had been\ndiscovered. Could they elude the pursuit of the natives? Had they been\nperceived? Would their tracks betray them? At this moment the lower strata of vapor rose, enveloping them for an\ninstant in a moist cloud, and they discerned, three hundred feet below\nthem, the frantic crowd of savages. They saw, but were also seen. Renewed yells resounded, mingled with\nbarks; and the whole tribe, after vainly endeavoring to climb the rock,\nrushed out of the inclosure and hastened by the shortest paths in\npursuit of the prisoners, who fled in terror from their vengeance.

Villefort quietly opened a window, saying, “It is\nvery warm, and the heat affects M. Noirtier.” He then returned to his\nplace, but did not sit down. “This marriage,” added Madame de Villefort, “is quite agreeable to the\nwishes of M. d’Épinay and his family; besides, he had no relations\nnearer than an uncle and aunt, his mother having died at his birth, and\nhis father having been assassinated in 1815, that is to say, when he\nwas but two years old; it naturally followed that the child was\npermitted to choose his own pursuits, and he has, therefore, seldom\nacknowledged any other authority but that of his own will.”\n\n“That assassination was a mysterious affair,” said Villefort, “and the\nperpetrators have hitherto escaped detection, although suspicion has\nfallen on the head of more than one person.”\n\nNoirtier made such an effort that his lips expanded into a smile. “Now,” continued Villefort, “those to whom the guilt really belongs, by\nwhom the crime was committed, on whose heads the justice of man may\nprobably descend here, and the certain judgment of God hereafter, would\nrejoice in the opportunity thus afforded of bestowing such a\npeace-offering as Valentine on the son of him whose life they so\nruthlessly destroyed.” Noirtier had succeeded in mastering his emotion\nmore than could have been deemed possible with such an enfeebled and\nshattered frame. “Yes, I understand,” was the reply contained in his look; and this look\nexpressed a feeling of strong indignation, mixed with profound\ncontempt. Villefort fully understood his father’s meaning, and answered\nby a slight shrug of his shoulders.

BETWEEN FIRE AND WATER. Jacques Paganel's story had a very great success.

However, they were agreed on this point, that it was necessary to have\ncourage for every fortune, and be contented with a tree when one has\nneither palace nor cottage. During the course of this confabulation evening had come on. Only a\ngood sleep could thoroughly refresh, after this eventful day. The\ninmates of the tree felt themselves not only fatigued by the sudden\nchanges of the inundation, but especially overcome by the heat, which\nhad been excessive. Their feathered companions had already set the\nexample; the hilgueros, those nightingales of the Pampas, had ceased\ntheir melodious warblings, and all the birds had disappeared in the\nrecesses of the foliage. The best plan was to imitate them. But before \"retiring to their nest,\" as Paganel said, Glenarvan,\nRobert, and he climbed to the observatory, to examine for the last\ntime the watery expanse. It was about nine o'clock. The sun had just\nset in the sparkling mists of the horizon, and all the western part\nof the firmament was bathed in a warm vapor. The constellations,\nusually so dazzling, seemed veiled in a soft haze. Still they could\nbe distinguished, and Paganel pointed out to Robert, for Glenarvan's\nbenefit, that zone where the stars are most brilliant. [Sidenote: PHILOSOPHY AND PONCHOS.] While the geographer was discoursing thus, the whole eastern horizon\nassumed a stormy aspect. A dense and dark band, clearly defined,\ngradually rose, dimming the light of the stars. This cloud of\nthreatening appearance soon invaded almost the entire vault of the sky. Its motive power must have been inherent in itself, for there was not\na breath of wind. Not a leaf stirred on the tree, not a ripple curled\nthe surface of the waters. Even the air seemed to fail, as if some\nhuge pneumatic machine had rarefied it. A strong electric current was\nperceptible in the atmosphere, and every creature felt it course along\nthe nerves. Glenarvan, Paganel, and Robert were sensibly affected by\nthese electric currents. \"We shall have a storm,\" said Paganel. \"You are not afraid of thunder?\" asked Glenarvan of the boy. \"Oh, no, my lord,\" replied Robert. \"Well, so much the better; for the storm is now not far distant.\" \"And it will be violent,\" continued Paganel, \"so far as I can judge\nfrom the state of the sky.\" \"It is not the storm that troubles me,\" said Glenarvan, \"but the\ntorrents of rain with which it will be accompanied. We shall be\ndrenched to the skin again. Whatever you may say, Paganel, a nest\ncannot suffice a man, as you will soon learn to your cost.\" \"Oh, yes, it can, with philosophy,\" briskly replied the geographer. \"Philosophy does not prevent you from getting wet.\" \"No, but it warms you.\" \"Well, then,\" said Glenarvan, \"let us join our friends and persuade\nthem to envelop us with their philosophy and their ponchos as closely\nas possible, and especially to lay in a stock of patience, for we shall\nneed it.\" So saying, he gave another look at the threatening sky.

He passed his time in studying the maps with which\nhe covered the cabin-table; and then followed daily discussions with\nMr. Olbinett, so that he could scarcely set the table. But Paganel had all the passengers on his side except the major,\nwho was very indifferent to geographical questions, especially at\ndinner-time. Having discovered a whole cargo of odd books in the mate's\nchests, and among them a number of Cervantes' works, the Frenchman\nresolved to learn Spanish, which nobody on board knew, and which would\nfacilitate his search on the shores of Chili. Thanks to his love for\nphilology, he did not despair of speaking this new tongue fluently on\narriving at Concepcion. He therefore studied assiduously, and was heard\nincessantly muttering heterogeneous syllables. During his leisure hours\nhe did not fail to give young Robert practical instruction, and taught\nhim the history of the country they were rapidly approaching. In the meantime the Duncan was proceeding at a remarkable rate. She\ncut the Tropic of Capricorn, and her prow was headed toward the strait\nof the celebrated geographer. Now and then the low shores of Patagonia\nwere seen, but like an almost invisible line on the horizon. They\nsailed along the coast for more than ten miles, but Paganel's famous\ntelescope gave him only a vague idea of these American shores. The vessel soon found herself at the head of the strait, and entered\nwithout hesitation. This way is generally preferred by steam-vessels\nbound for the Pacific. Its exact length is three hundred and\nseventy-six miles. Ships of the greatest tonnage can always find deep\nwater, even near its shores, an excellent bottom, and many springs of\nwater. The rivers abound in fish, the forest in game, there are safe\nand easy landings at twenty places, and, in short, a thousand resources\nthat are wanting in the Strait of Lemaire, and off the terrible rocks\nof Cape Horn, which are continually visited by storms and tempests.

The entire passage lasted scarcely\nthirty-six hours, and this moving panorama of the two shores well\nrewarded the pains the geographer took to admire it under the radiant\nbeams of the southern sun. No inhabitant appeared on the shores of the\ncontinent; and only a few Fuegians wandered along the barren rocks of\nTerra del Fuego. At one moment the Duncan rounded the peninsula of Brunswick between\ntwo magnificent sights. Just here the strait cuts between stupendous\nmasses of granite.

The\nspectacles and telescope gave him a high opinion of Paganel, whom he\nattached carefully to his person, not only by his benefits, but by\nstrong flaxen ropes, especially at night. This novel situation lasted three long days. Was he well or badly\ntreated? Both, as he stated without further explanation. In short, he\nwas a prisoner, and, except for the prospect of immediate torture,\nhis condition did not seem more enviable than that of his unfortunate\nfriends. Fortunately, last night he succeeded in biting asunder his ropes and\nescaping. He had witnessed at a distance the burial of the chief,\nknew that he had been interred on the summit of Maunganamu mountain,\nand that it was tabooed in consequence. He therefore resolved to take\nrefuge there, not wishing to leave the place where his companions were\nheld captives. He succeeded in his undertaking, arrived at Kara-Tété's\ntomb, and waited in hope that Providence would in some way deliver his\nfriends. Such was Paganel's story. Did he omit designedly any circumstance\nof his stay among the natives? More than once his embarrassment led\nthem to suspect so.

This\nbeautiful creature was called Thaouka, which means \"bird\" in the\nPatagonian language, and he justly merited this appellation. [Sidenote: A FRESH START.] When Thalcave was in the saddle, the horse pranced with spirited grace,\nand the Patagonian, a skillful rider, was magnificent to behold. His\noutfit comprised two weapons of the chase, the \"bolas\" and the lasso. The bolas consists of three balls tied together by a leathern string,\nwhich are fastened to the front of the saddle. The Indians frequently\nthrow them the distance of a hundred paces at the animal or enemy that\nthey are pursuing, and with such precision that they twist about their\nlegs and bring them to the ground. It is, therefore, in their hands a\nformidable instrument, and they handle it with surprising dexterity. The lasso, on the contrary, does not leave the hand that wields it. It\nconsists simply of a leathern thong thirty feet in length, terminating\nin a slip-noose which works upon an iron ring. The right hand throws\nthe slip-noose, while the left hand holds the remainder of the lasso,\nthe end of which is firmly tied to the saddle. A long carbine in a\nsling completed the Patagonian's armament. Thalcave, without observing the admiration caused by his natural\ngrace, ease and courage, took the lead, and the party advanced, now\nat a gallop, and now at a walk, for their horses seemed entirely\nunaccustomed to trotting. Robert mounted with much boldness, and\nspeedily convinced Glenarvan of his ability to keep his seat. On issuing from the gorges of the Andes, they encountered a great\nnumber of sand-ridges, called \"medanos,\" real waves incessantly\nagitated by the wind, when the roots of the herbage did not confine\nthem to the earth. This sand is of an extreme fineness; and, at the\nleast breath, they saw it float away in light clouds, or form regular\nsand-columns which rose to a considerable height. This spectacle caused\npleasure as well as annoyance to the eyes. Pleasure, for nothing was\nmore curious than these columns, wandering over the plain, struggling,\nmingling, sinking and rising in inexpressible confusion; and annoyance,\nsince an impalpable dust emanated from these innumerable medanos and\npenetrated the eyelids, however tightly they were closed.

They encamped on the shores of a turbulent stream, enclosed by lofty\nred cliffs. Toward noon of the next day, the sun's rays became very\noppressive, and at evening a line of clouds on the horizon indicated\na change in the weather. The Patagonian could not be deceived, and\npointed out to the geographer the western portion of the sky. \"Good, I know,\" said Paganel, and addressing his companions: \"A change\nin the weather is about to take place.

What path take?\" At this very moment, as if in answer to the major, a cry of distress\nwas heard. \"Listen!\" said Glenarvan. The cry came from the very direction whence the report had sounded, but\nless than a quarter of a mile distant. Glenarvan, pushing back MacNabb,\nwas advancing along the path, when, not far from the cart, these words\nwere uttered:\n\n\"Help! help!\" It was a plaintive and despairing voice. Captain Mangles and the major\nrushed towards it. In a few moments they perceived, on the edge of\nthe coppice, a human form that was dragging itself along and groaning\npiteously. It was Mulready, wounded and half dead. When his companions\nraised him, they felt their hands dabbling in blood. The rain now\nincreased, and the wind howled through the branches of the dead trees. In the midst of these terrific gusts, Glenarvan, the major, and the\ncaptain bore the body of Mulready. On arriving at the cart, Paganel, Robert, Wilson, and Olbinett came\nout, and Lady Helena gave up her room to the poor sailor. The major\ntook off Mulready's vest, wet with blood and rain. He discovered the\nwound. It was a poniard stab, which the unfortunate had received in his\nright side. MacNabb dressed it skillfully. Whether the weapon had reached the vital\nparts, he could not say. A stream of bright-red blood spurted forth,\nwhile the paleness and the swoon of the wounded man proved that he had\nbeen seriously injured. The major accordingly placed upon the opening\nof the wound, after first washing it with fresh water, a thick wad of\ntinder, and then a few layers of lint, confined by a bandage, and thus\nsucceeded in stopping the hemorrhage. The patient was then laid on his\nside, his head and breast raised, and Lady Helena gave him a refreshing\ndraught. At the end of a quarter of an hour, the wounded man, who had been\nmotionless till then, made a movement. His eyes half opened, his lips\nmurmured disconnected words, and the major, putting down his ear, heard\nhim say:\n\n\"My lord--the letter--Ben Joyce----\"\n\n[Sidenote: A DAY OF DOUBT.] The major repeated these words, and glanced at his companions. What did\nMulready mean? Ben Joyce had attacked the sailor, but why? Was it not\nsimply for the purpose of preventing him from reaching the Duncan? This\nletter--Glenarvan examined the sailor's pockets. The letter addressed\nto Tom Austin was gone. The night passed in anxiety and anguish. They feared every moment that\nthe wounded man would die. A burning fever consumed him. Lady Helena\nand Mary Grant, as though his sisters, did not leave him; never was\npatient better nursed, or by more tender hands. Day appeared. The rain had ceased. Heavy clouds still rolled along\nthe vault of the sky, and the earth was strewn with the fragments of\nbranches. The clay, soaked by floods of water, had yielded; and the\nsides of the cart became unsteady, but sank no deeper. Captain Mangles, Paganel, and Glenarvan took a tour of exploration\naround the camp. They traversed the path still marked with blood, but\nfound no trace of Ben Joyce or his band. They went to the place where\nthe attack had been made. Here two corpses lay on the ground, shot\nby Mulready. One was the farrier of Black Point. His face, which had\nmortified, was a horrible sight. Glenarvan did not pursue his investigations farther, prudence\nforbidding. He therefore returned to the cart, much alarmed by the\nseriousness of the situation. \"We cannot think of sending another messenger to Melbourne,\" said he.", "similarity": 0.423917680978775}, {"chunk_id": 70, "text": "At four o'clock in the morning day began to break.

Glenarvan did not reply, but sprang upon Robert's horse, and the two\nwere soon galloping towards the west in the direction from which their\ncompanions were to come. For an hour they traveled thus with great speed, gazing around for\nRobert, and dreading at each step to behold his mangled body. Glenarvan\ntortured the flanks of his horse with his spurs. Suddenly shots were\nheard, and reports at regular intervals, like signals for recognition. [Illustration]\n\n\"It is they!\" cried Glenarvan. Thalcave and he urged their horses to a more rapid pace, and a few\nmoments afterwards they joined the party led by Paganel.

Then it was the Indian's turn to clasp to his breast the courageous son\nof Captain Grant. \"He lives! he lives!\" exclaimed Glenarvan. \"Yes,\" replied Robert, \"thanks to Thaouka.\" The Indian had not waited for these words of gratitude to embrace his\nhorse, but at that very moment he spoke to him and embraced him, as\nif human blood flowed in the veins of the noble animal. Then, turning\ntowards Paganel, he pointed to young Robert. \"A brave boy!\" said he. Glenarvan, however, asked, even while he admired the lad,--\n\n\"Why, my son, did you not let Thalcave or me try this last chance of\nsaving you?\" \"My lord,\" replied he, in accents of the liveliest gratitude, \"was it\nnot my duty to sacrifice myself, when Thalcave has saved my life, and\nyou are going to save my father?\" CHAPTER XX. STRANGE SIGNS. After their first outbursts of joy at meeting were over, Paganel,\nAustin, Wilson, and Mulready--all who had remained behind, except the\nmajor--were conscious of one thing, namely, that they were suffering\nfrom thirst. Fortunately, the Guamini flowed at no great distance. They accordingly continued their journey, and at seven o'clock in the\nmorning the little party arrived at the ramada. On seeing its entrance\nstrewn with the bodies of the wolves, it was easy to understand the\nviolence of the attack and the vigor of the defense. The travelers,\nafter fully quenching their thirst, devoted their attention to\nbreakfast in the inclosure. The ostrich-steaks were declared excellent,\nand the armadillo, roasted in its own covering, was a delicious dish. \"To eat reasonably of this,\" said Paganel, \"would be ingratitude\ntowards Providence. We really must eat immoderately.\" And he did so accordingly,--but was not sick, thanks to the clear water\nof the Guamini, which appeared to possess superior digestive properties. [Sidenote: AEROSTATIC EXPERIMENTS.] At ten o'clock Glenarvan gave the signal for departure. The\nwater-bottles were filled, and they set out. The horses, being greatly\nrevived, evinced much spirit, and maintained an easy and almost\ncontinuous canter. The next morning they crossed the boundary which\nseparates the Argentine Plains from the Pampas.

But was Jacques Paganel to die a bachelor? Certainly not; for, after\nhis heroic exploits, the worthy geographer could not escape celebrity. His eccentricities (and his abilities) made him much talked of in\nScotland. People seemed as though they could not show him enough\nattention. Just at this time an amiable lady of thirty, none other than the\nmajor's cousin, a little eccentric herself, but still agreeable and\ncharming, fell in love with the geographer's peculiarities. Paganel was\nfar from being insensible to Miss Arabella's attractions, yet did not\ndare to declare his sentiments. The major accordingly undertook the\npart of Cupid's messenger between these two congenial hearts, and even\ntold Paganel that marriage was \"the last blunder\" that he could commit. But the geographer was very much embarrassed, and, strangely enough,\ncould not summon courage to speak for himself. [Illustration: Early in the afternoon the travelers reached Malcolm\nCastle, amidst the hurrahs of their tenantry and friends.] \"Does not Miss Arabella please you?\" MacNabb would say to him. \"Oh, major, she is charming!\" cried Paganel,--\"a thousand times too\ncharming for me; and, if I must tell you, would please me better if she\nwere less so. I should like to find a defect.\" \"Be easy,\" answered the major; \"she has more than one. The most perfect\nwoman always has her share. Well, then, Paganel, are you decided?\" \"I do not dare.\" \"But, my learned friend, why do you hesitate?\" \"I am unworthy of her!\" was the geographer's invariable reply. At last, one day, driven desperate by the irrepressible major, Paganel\nconfessed to him, under the pledge of secrecy, a peculiarity that would\nfacilitate his identification, if the police should ever be on his\ntrack! \"Bah!\" exclaimed the major. \"It is as I tell you,\" persisted Paganel. \"What matter, my worthy friend?\" \"Is that your opinion?\" \"On the contrary, you are only more remarkable. This adds to your\npersonal advantages. It makes you the inimitable individual of whom\nArabella has dreamed.\" And the major, preserving an imperturbable gravity, left Paganel a prey\nto the most acute anxiety. A short interview took place between MacNabb and the lady, and fifteen\nweeks after a marriage was celebrated with great pomp in the chapel of\nMalcolm Castle. [Illustration: Fifteen weeks after a marriage was celebrated with great\npomp in the chapel of Malcolm Castle.] The geographer's secret would doubtless have remained forever\nburied in the abysses of the unknown if the major had not told it to\nGlenarvan, who did not conceal it from Lady Helena, who communicated\nit to Mrs. Mangles. In short, it reached the ear of Mrs. Olbinett, and\nspread. Jacques Paganel, during his three days' captivity among the Maoris, had\nbeen tattooed from head to foot, and bore on his breast the picture of\nan heraldic kiwi with outstretched wings, in the act of biting at his\nheart. This was the only adventure of his great voyage for which Paganel\ncould never be consoled or pardon the New Zealanders. In spite of the\nrepresentations of his friends, he dared not go back to France, for\nfear of exposing the whole Geographical Society in his person to the\njests and railleries of the caricaturists.", "similarity": 0.3778265118598938}, {"chunk_id": 216, "text": "Paganel wondered whether he should\nconsider himself a prisoner; but seeing that he could not take a step\nwithout being graciously accompanied by the chief, he soon knew how\nmatters stood on this point. The chief, whose name was \"Hihy\" (sunbeam), was not a bad man. The\nspectacles and telescope gave him a high opinion of Paganel, whom he\nattached carefully to his person, not only by his benefits, but by\nstrong flaxen ropes, especially at night. This novel situation lasted three long days. Was he well or badly\ntreated? Both, as he stated without further explanation. In short, he\nwas a prisoner, and, except for the prospect of immediate torture,\nhis condition did not seem more enviable than that of his unfortunate\nfriends. Fortunately, last night he succeeded in biting asunder his ropes and\nescaping. He had witnessed at a distance the burial of the chief,\nknew that he had been interred on the summit of Maunganamu mountain,\nand that it was tabooed in consequence. He therefore resolved to take\nrefuge there, not wishing to leave the place where his companions were\nheld captives. He succeeded in his undertaking, arrived at Kara-Tété's\ntomb, and waited in hope that Providence would in some way deliver his\nfriends. Such was Paganel's story. Did he omit designedly any circumstance\nof his stay among the natives? More than once his embarrassment led\nthem to suspect so. However that might be, he received unanimous\ncongratulations; and as the past was now known, they returned to the\npresent. Their situation was still exceedingly critical. The natives, if they\ndid not venture to climb the mountain, expected that hunger and thirst\nwould force their prisoners to surrender. It was only a matter of time,\nand the savages had great patience. Glenarvan did not disregard the\ndifficulties of his position, but waited for the favorable issue which\nProvidence seemed to promise. And first he wished to examine this improvised fortress; not to defend\nit, for an attack was not to be feared, but that he might find a way of\nescaping. The major and the captain, Robert, Paganel, and himself, took\nthe exact bearings of the mountain. They observed the direction of the\npaths, their branches and declivities. A ridge a mile in length united\nthe Maunganamu to the Wahiti range, and then declined to the plain. Its\nnarrow and winding summit presented the only practicable route, in case\nescape should become possible. If the fugitives could pass this point\nunperceived, under cover of the night, perhaps they might succeed in\nreaching the deep valleys and outwitting the Maoris. But this course offered more than one danger, as they would have to\npass below within gun-shot. The bullets of the natives on the lower\nramparts of the pah might intercept them, and form a barrier that no\none could safely cross. Glenarvan and his friends, as soon as they ventured on the dangerous\npart of the ridge, were saluted with a volley of shots; but only a\nfew wads, borne by the wind, reached them.

It was \"_Il mio tesoro tanto_\"\nfrom Don Juan. [Illustration: Paganel did not lie down, but, rifle on shoulder,\nguarded the encampment, walking to and fro that he might the better\nresist sleep.] \"Parbleu!\" thought the geographer, \"however strange the Australian\nbirds may be, or even though the parrots were the most musical in the\nworld, they could not sing Mozart.\" He listened to the end of this grand inspiration of the master. The\neffect of this sweet melody, in the stillness of the starlit night,\nwas indescribable. He remained a long time under the influences of its\nenchantment. At last the voice ceased, and all was silent. When Wilson came to relieve the geographer, he found him wrapt in a\nprofound reverie. Paganel said nothing to the sailor, but, reserving\nhis account of the incident for Glenarvan the next day, he crept into\nthe tent. In the morning the whole party were awakened by unexpected bayings. Glenarvan at once arose. Two magnificent pointers were gamboling along\nthe edge of a small wood; but at the approach of the travelers they\ndisappeared among the trees, barking loudly. \"There must be a station in this desert,\" said Glenarvan, \"and hunters,\nsince those are hunting-dogs.\" Paganel was just about to relate his experiences of the past night,\nwhen two men appeared, in hunting costume, mounted on fine horses. They\nnaturally stopped at sight of the little party, encamped in gypsy-like\nfashion, and seemed to be wondering what the presence of armed men in\nthis place meant, when they perceived the ladies, who were alighting\nfrom the cart. They immediately dismounted, and advanced towards them, hat in hand. Glenarvan went to meet them, and introduced himself and party, giving\nthe name and rank of each member. The young men bowed, and one of them,\nthe elder, said:\n\n\"My lord, will your ladies, your companions, and yourself do us the\nhonor to accompany us to our house?\" \"May I ask, gentlemen, whom I have the honor of addressing?\" inquired\nGlenarvan. \"Michael and Alexander Patterson, proprietors of Hottam Station.

Manuel did not think of any other calling than that of the\nsoldier, and hoped, in time, with the help of God, to offer to the\nrepublic a whole battalion of young soldiers. \"You have seen them?\" said he. \"Charming fellows! Good soldiers! José! Juan! Miguel! Pepe! Pepe is only seven years old, and is already biting\nhis cartridge!\" Pepe, hearing himself complimented, joined his two little feet, and\npresented arms with perfect precision. \"He will do!\" added the sergeant. \"He will be a major--or\nbrigadier-general one day!\" This story lasted a quarter of an hour, to Thalcave's great\nastonishment. The Indian could not understand how so many words could\ncome from a single throat. No one interrupted the commander; and even\na French sergeant had to conclude at last, though not without forcing\nhis guests to accompany him to his dwelling. Here they were introduced\nto Madame Ipharaguerre, who appeared to be \"a good-looking person,\" if\nthis expression may be employed in regard to an Indian. When he had exhausted himself, the sergeant asked his guests to what he\nowed the honor of their visit. And now it was their turn to explain. Paganel, opening the conversation in French, told him of their journey\nacross the Pampas, and ended by asking why the Indians had abandoned\nthe country. \"War!\" replied the sergeant. \"War?\" \"Yes, civil war.\" \"Civil war?\" rejoined Paganel. \"Yes, war between Paraguay and Buenos Ayres,\" answered the sergeant. \"Well?\" \"Why, all the Indians of the north are in the rear of General Flores,\nand those of the plains are plundering.\" \"But the caziques?\" \"The caziques with them.\" This answer was reported to Thalcave, who shook his head. Indeed,\nhe either did not know, or had forgotten, that a civil war, which\nwas afterwards to involve Brazil, was decimating two-thirds of the\nrepublic. The Indians had everything to gain in these internal\nstruggles, and could not neglect such fine opportunities for plunder. The sergeant, therefore, was not mistaken in attributing this desertion\nof the Pampas to the civil war that was being waged in the northern\npart of the Argentine Provinces. But this event disconcerted Glenarvan's hopes. If Captain Grant was\na prisoner of the caziques, he must have been carried by them to the\nnorthern frontiers. Yet how and where to find him? Must they attempt\na perilous and almost useless search to the northern limits of the\nPampas? It was a serious matter, which was to be earnestly considered. However, one important question was still to be asked of the sergeant,\nand the major thought of this, while his companions were looking at\neach other in silence. \"Have you heard of any Europeans being retained as prisoners by the\ncaziques of the Pampas?\" Manuel reflected for a few moments, like a man who recalls events to\nrecollection. \"Yes,\" said he, at length. \"Ah!\" cried Glenarvan, conceiving a new hope.

The mildness\nof the climate justified this light costume. Each of these young\nsoldiers carried a gun and a sword, which were too long and heavy for\nthe little fellows. All had a certain family resemblance, and the\ncorporal who commanded resembled them too: they were twelve brothers,\nwho were parading under the orders of the thirteenth.

But what surprised him exceedingly was to see these\nlittle soldiers practicing the French tactics, and to hear the orders\nof the corporal given in his own native language. \"This is singular,\" said he. But Glenarvan had not come to see boys drill, still less to occupy\nhimself with their nationality or relationship. He did not, therefore,\ngive Paganel time to express further astonishment, but besought him\nto ask for the commander of the fortress. Paganel did so, and one of\nthe soldiers proceeded towards a small building which served as the\nbarracks. A few moments after, the commander appeared in person.

Thalcave, addressing him, introduced Lord Glenarvan and his companions. While he spoke, the commander kept scrutinizing Paganel with quite\nembarrassing persistence.

Ayrton, on the contrary, gave\nonly a secondary attention to these costly luxuries. He first examined\nthe yacht from a sailor's point of view. He explored the hold; he\nwent down into the engine-room; he looked at the engine, inquired\nits effective power and consumption; he visited the coal-house, the\npantry, and the powder-magazine, and took particular interest in the\ngun-room and the mounted cannon in the forecastle. Glenarvan now had to\ndeal with a man who was a critical judge, as he could see by Ayrton's\nkeen inquiries. At last the quartermaster finished his exploration by\ninspecting the masts and rigging; and, after a few moments of general\nreview, said:\n\n\"You have a fine vessel, my lord.\" \"A good one, too,\" replied Glenarvan. \"How many tons' burden is she?\" \"Two hundred and ten.\" \"Shall I be greatly mistaken,\" added Ayrton, \"if I say that the Duncan\ncan easily make fifteen knots an hour at full speed?\" \"Say seventeen,\" interposed the captain, \"and you will be nearer\nright.\" \"Seventeen!\" cried the quartermaster: \"why, then, no man-of-war, not\neven the best, could overtake her.\" \"Not one,\" said the captain. \"The Duncan is a real racing yacht, and is\nnot to be beaten in any way.\" \"Not even in sailing?\" asked Ayrton. \"Not even in sailing.\" \"Well, my lord, and you, captain, accept the compliments of a sailor\nwho knows what a vessel is worth.\" \"Thanks, Ayrton,\" replied Glenarvan; \"and now remain on board, and it\nwill be your own fault if the ship is not all you can desire.\" \"I will think of it, my lord,\" said the quartermaster, modestly. Mr. Olbinett now approached, and informed Lord Glenarvan that dinner\nwas ready; and they all adjourned to the saloon. \"That Ayrton is an intelligent man,\" said Paganel to the major. \"Too intelligent!\" growled MacNabb, who, without any apparent reason,\ndisliked the looks and manners of the quartermaster.", "similarity": 0.48031285405158997}, {"chunk_id": 97, "text": "Glenarvan, the major, and the sailors, delighted to see their\nfaithful guide again, shook his hands with the most earnest cordiality. The Patagonian then conducted them to an abandoned estancia. Here\na good fire was burning, which revived them, and on the coals were\nroasting succulent slices of venison, to which they did ample justice. And when their refreshed minds began to reflect, they could scarcely\nbelieve that they had escaped so many perils,--the fire, the water, and\nthe formidable alligators. Thalcave, in a few words, told his story to Paganel, and ascribed to\nhis intrepid horse all the honor of having saved him. Paganel then\nendeavored to explain to him the new interpretation of the document,\nand the hopes it led them to entertain. Did the Indian understand the\ngeographer's ingenious suppositions? It was very doubtful; but he saw\nhis friends happy and very confident, and he desired nothing more. It may be easily believed that these courageous travelers, after their\nday of rest on the tree, needed no urging to resume their journey. At\neight o'clock in the morning they were ready to start. They were too\nfar south to procure means of transport, and were therefore obliged\nto travel on foot. The distance, however, was only forty miles, and\nThaouka would not refuse to carry from time to time a tired pedestrian. In thirty-six hours they would reach the shores of the Atlantic. [Sidenote: IN THE DARK.] As soon as refreshed the guide and his companions left behind them\nthe immense basin, still covered with the waters, and proceeded across\nelevated plains, on which, here and there, were seen groves planted by\nEuropeans, meadows, and occasionally native trees. Thus the day passed. The next morning, fifteen miles before reaching the ocean, its\nproximity was perceptible. They hastened on in order to reach Lake\nSalado, on the shores of the Atlantic, the same day. They were\nbeginning to feel fatigued, when they perceived sand-hills that hid the\nfoaming waves, and soon the prolonged murmur of the rising tide struck\nupon their ears. \"The ocean!\" cried Paganel. \"Yes, the ocean!\" replied Thalcave. And these wanderers, whose strength had seemed almost about to fail,\nclimbed the mounds with wonderful agility. But the darkness was\nprofound, and their eyes wandered in vain over the gloomy expanse. They\nlooked for the Duncan, but could not discern her. \"She is there, at all events,\" said Glenarvan, \"waiting for us.\" \"We shall see her to-morrow,\" replied MacNabb. Tom Austin shouted seaward, but received no answer. The wind was very\nstrong, and the sea tempestuous. The clouds were driving from the west,\nand the foaming crests of the waves broke over the beach in masses of\nspray. If the Duncan was at the appointed rendezvous, the lookout man\ncould neither hear nor be heard. The coast afforded no shelter. There\nwas no bay, no harbor, no cove; not even a creek. The beach consisted\nof long sand-banks that were lost in the sea, and the vicinity of\nwhich is more dangerous than that of the rocks in the face of wind and\ntide. These banks, in fact, increase the waves; the sea is peculiarly\nboisterous around them, and ships are sure to be lost if they strike on\nthese bars in heavy storms. It was therefore very natural that the Duncan, considering this coast\ndangerous, and knowing it to be without a port of shelter, kept at a\ndistance. Captain Mangles must have kept to the windward as far as\npossible. This was Tom Austin's opinion, and he declared that the\nDuncan was not less than five miles at sea.", "similarity": 0.4309898912906647}, {"chunk_id": 190, "text": "A DREADED COUNTRY. What Paganel had stated was indisputable. The cruelty of the New\nZealanders could not be doubted. There was, therefore, danger in\nlanding. But if the danger had been a hundred times greater, it must\nhave been faced. Captain Mangles felt the necessity of leaving this\nvessel, which would soon break up. Between two perils, one certain, the\nother only probable, there was no possible hesitation. [Sidenote: ANOTHER CHANGE OF RESIDENCE.] As for the chance of being picked up by some passing ship, they could\nnot reasonably rely upon it, for the Macquarie was out of the course\nusually taken in going to New Zealand. The shipwreck had happened on\nthe desert shores of Ika-Na-Maoui. \"When shall we start?\" asked Glenarvan. \"To-morrow morning at ten o'clock,\" replied Captain Mangles. \"The tide\nwill begin to rise then, and will carry us ashore.\" Early the next day the raft was finished. The captain had given\nhis entire attention to its construction. They needed a steady and\nmanageable craft, and one capable of resisting the waves for a voyage\nof nine miles. The masts of the brig could alone furnish the necessary\nmaterials. The raft was at length completed. It could doubtless sustain the shock\nof the surges; but could it be steered, and the coast be reached, if\nthe wind should veer? This was a question only to be decided by trial. At nine o'clock the loading began. The provisions were first put on\nboard in sufficient quantities to last until the arrival at Auckland,\nfor there could be no reliance upon the products of this dreaded\ncountry. Olbinett furnished some preserved meats, the remains of the\nMacquarie's supplies. There was very little, however; and they were\nforced to depend upon the coarse fare of the mess, which consisted of\nvery inferior ship-biscuits and two barrels of salt fish, greatly to\nthe steward's regret. These stores were inclosed in sealed cans and then secured to the foot\nof the mast. The arms and ammunition were put in a safe and dry place. Fortunately, the travelers were well supplied with rifles and revolvers. A small anchor was taken on board, in case they should reach the shore\nat low tide and be forced to anchor in the offing. Flood-tide soon\nbegan, the breeze blew gently from the northwest, and a slight swell\nagitated the surface of the sea. \"Are we ready?\" asked Captain Mangles. \"All is ready, captain,\" replied Wilson. \"Aboard, then!\" Lady Helena and Mary Grant descended the ship's side by a clumsy\nrope-ladder, and took their seats at the foot of the mast near the\ncases of provisions, their companions around them. Wilson took the\nhelm, the captain stationed himself at the sail-tackling, and Mulready\ncut the cable that confined the raft to the brig. The sail was spread,\nand they began to move towards the shore under the combined influence\nof wind and tide. The coast was only nine miles distant,--not a difficult voyage for a\nwell-manned boat; but with the raft it was necessary to advance slowly. If the wind held out, they might perhaps reach land with this tide; but\nif there should be a calm, the ebb would carry them back, or they would\nbe compelled to anchor and wait for the next tide. However, Captain Mangles hoped to succeed. The wind freshened. As it\nhad been flood now for some hours, they must either reach land soon, or\nanchor.

He considered them plunderers and robbers, and only sought to avoid\nthem. According to his orders, the little party collected together, and\nmade ready their fire-arms. It was necessary to be prepared for any\nemergency. The Indian detachment was soon perceived. It consisted of only ten\nmen, which fact reassured the Patagonian. They approached within a\nhundred paces, so that they could be easily distinguished. Their high\nforeheads, prominent rather than receding, their tall forms, and their\nolive color, showed them to be magnificent types of the Indian race. They were clad in the skins of guanacos, and carried various weapons of\nwar and the chase, while their dexterity in horsemanship was remarkable. [Illustration]\n\nHaving halted, they appeared to hold a conference, crying and\ngesticulating. Glenarvan advanced toward them; but he had not proceeded\ntwo yards, when the detachment wheeled about and disappeared with\nincredible swiftness. The tired horses of the travelers could never\nhave overtaken them. \"The cowards!\" cried Paganel. \"They fly too fast for honest men,\" said MacNabb. \"What are these Indians?\" inquired Paganel of Thalcave. \"Gauchos!\" replied the Patagonian. \"Gauchos!\" repeated Paganel, turning toward his companions, \"Gauchos! We had no need, then, to take such precautions. There was nothing to\nfear!\" \"Why?\" asked the major. \"Because the Gauchos are inoffensive peasants.\" \"Do you think so, Paganel?\" \"Certainly. They took us for robbers, and fled.\" Glenarvan was quite disappointed in not speaking with them, as he\nexpected to obtain additional tidings of the lost sailors; but it\nwas necessary to push on, if they would reach their destination that\nevening. At eight o'clock Thalcave, who had gone a little in advance, announced\nthat the lake so long desired was in sight. A quarter of an hour\nafterward the little party descended the high banks. But here a serious\ndisappointment awaited them,--the lake was dry! CHAPTER XVIII. IN SEARCH OF WATER. Lake Salinas terminates the cluster of lagoons that adjoin the Ventana\nand Guamini mountains. Numerous expeditions are made to this place\nto obtain supplies of salt, with which these waters are strongly\nimpregnated. But now the water had evaporated under the heat of the\nsun, and the lake was only a vast glittering basin. When Thalcave announced the presence of a drinkable liquid at Lake\nSalinas, he meant the streams of fresh water that flow from it in\nmany places. But at this time its affluents were as dry as itself. The burning sun had absorbed everything. Hence, the consternation was\ngeneral when the thirsty party arrived at the parched shores of Lake\nSalinas. It was necessary to take counsel. The little water in the leathern\nbottles was half spoiled, and could not quench their thirst, which\nbegan to make itself acutely felt. Hunger and fatigue gave place to\nthis imperative want. A \"roukah,\" a kind of upright tent, of leather,\nwhich stood in a hollow, and had been abandoned by the natives, served\nas a refuge for the travelers, while their horses, stretched on the\nmuddy shores of the lake, ate the saline plants and dry reeds, although\nreluctantly. When each had sat down in the roukah, Paganel asked Thalcave's advice\nas to what was best to be done. A rapid conversation, of which\nGlenarvan caught a few words, ensued between the geographer and the\nIndian. Thalcave spoke calmly, while Paganel gesticulated for both.", "similarity": 0.46663686633110046}, {"chunk_id": 188, "text": "Then, when this\nis accomplished, how can we sail among the dangerous breakers, and\nin such profound darkness? Moreover, another reason induces me to\nwait. The wind promises to aid us, and I desire to profit by it, and\nam in hopes that it will drift the old hull out when the tide raises\nher. To-morrow, if I am not mistaken, the breeze will blow from the\nnorthwest. We will set the main-sails, and they will help to raise\nthe brig.\" [Illustration: They therefore anchored, half a cable's length distant,\nin ten fathoms of water.] These reasons were decisive. Glenarvan and Paganel, the most impatient\non board, yielded, and the work was suspended. The night passed favorably, and day appeared. Their captain's\npredictions were realized. The wind blew from the northwest, and\ncontinued to freshen. The crew were summoned. It was nine o'clock. Four\nhours were still to elapse before it would be high water, and that time\nwas not lost. The laborers renewed their efforts with very good success. Meantime the tide rose. The surface of the sea was agitated into\nripples, and the points of the rocks gradually disappeared, like\nmarine animals returning to their native element. The time for the\nfinal attempt approached. A feverish impatience thrilled all minds. No one spoke. Each gazed at the captain, and awaited his orders. He\nwas leaning over the stern-railing, watching the water, and casting an\nuneasy glance towards the cables. At last the tide reached its height. The experiment must now be made\nwithout delay. The main-sails were set, and the mast was bent with the\nforce of the wind. \"To the windlass!\" cried the captain. Glenarvan, Mulready, and Robert on one side, and Paganel, the major,\nand Olbinett on the other, bore down upon the handles that moved the\nmachine. At the same time the captain and Wilson added their efforts to\nthose of their companions. \"Down! down!\" cried the young captain; \"all together!\" The cables were stretched taut under the powerful action of the\nwindlass. The anchors held fast, and did not drag. But they must be\nquick, for high tide lasts only a few moments, and the water would not\nbe long in lowering. They redoubled their efforts. The wind blew violently, and forced the\nsails against the mast. A few tremors were felt in the hull, and the\nbrig seemed on the point of rising. Perhaps a little more power would\nsuffice to draw her from the sand. \"Helena! Mary!\" cried Glenarvan. The two ladies came and joined their efforts to those of their\ncompanions. A final crack was heard, but that was all! The experiment\nhad failed. The tide was already beginning to ebb, and it was evident\nthat, even with the aid of wind and tide, this insufficient crew could\nnot float their ship. As their first plan had failed, it was necessary to have recourse to\nthe second without delay. It was plain that they could not raise the\nMacquarie, and that the only way was to abandon her. To wait on board\nfor the uncertain arrival of assistance would have been folly and\nmadness. The captain therefore proposed to construct a raft strong enough to\nconvey the passengers and a sufficient quantity of provisions to the\nNew Zealand coast. It was not a time for discussion, but for action. The work was accordingly begun, and considerably advanced when night\ninterrupted them. In the evening, after supper, while Lady Helena and Mary Grant were\nreposing in their berths, Paganel and his friends conversed seriously\nas they paced the deck.", "similarity": 0.4768024981021881}, {"chunk_id": 22, "text": "What is\nhe doing?

Then you can quit your house, leaving your jewels and\ngiving up your jointure, and everyone’s mouth will be filled with\npraises of your disinterestedness. They will know you are deserted, and\nthink you also poor, for I alone know your real financial position, and\nam quite ready to give up my accounts as an honest partner.”\n\nThe dread with which the pale and motionless baroness listened to this,\nwas equalled by the calm indifference with which Debray had spoken. “Deserted?” she repeated; “ah, yes, I am, indeed, deserted! You are\nright, sir, and no one can doubt my position.”\n\nThese were the only words that this proud and violently enamoured woman\ncould utter in response to Debray. 50137m\n\n\n\n“But then you are rich,—very rich, indeed,” continued Debray, taking\nout some papers from his pocket-book, which he spread upon the table. Madame Danglars did not see them; she was engaged in stilling the\nbeatings of her heart, and restraining the tears which were ready to\ngush forth. At length a sense of dignity prevailed, and if she did not\nentirely master her agitation, she at least succeeded in preventing the\nfall of a single tear. “Madame,” said Debray, “it is nearly six months since we have been\nassociated. You furnished a principal of 100,000 francs. Our\npartnership began in the month of April. In May we commenced\noperations, and in the course of the month gained 450,000 francs. In\nJune the profit amounted to 900,000. In July we added 1,700,000\nfrancs,—it was, you know, the month of the Spanish bonds. In August we\nlost 300,000 francs at the beginning of the month, but on the 13th we\nmade up for it, and we now find that our accounts, reckoning from the\nfirst day of partnership up to yesterday, when I closed them, showed a\ncapital of 2,400,000 francs, that is, 1,200,000 for each of us. Now,\nmadame,” said Debray, delivering up his accounts in the methodical\nmanner of a stockbroker, “there are still 80,000 francs, the interest\nof this money, in my hands.”\n\n“But,” said the baroness, “I thought you never put the money out to\ninterest.”\n\n“Excuse me, madame,” said Debray coldly, “I had your permission to do\nso, and I have made use of it. There are, then, 40,000 francs for your\nshare, besides the 100,000 you furnished me to begin with, making in\nall 1,340,000 francs for your portion. Now, madame, I took the\nprecaution of drawing out your money the day before yesterday; it is\nnot long ago, you see, and I was in continual expectation of being\ncalled on to deliver up my accounts.

The guests were still at table, and the heated and energetic\nconversation that prevailed betrayed the violent and vindictive\npassions that then agitated each dweller of the South, where unhappily,\nfor five centuries religious strife had long given increased bitterness\nto the violence of party feeling. The emperor, now king of the petty Island of Elba, after having held\nsovereign sway over one-half of the world, counting as his subjects a\nsmall population of five or six thousand souls,—after having been\naccustomed to hear the “_Vive Napoléons_” of a hundred and twenty\nmillions of human beings, uttered in ten different languages,—was\nlooked upon here as a ruined man, separated forever from any fresh\nconnection with France or claim to her throne.

Villefort fully understood his father’s meaning, and answered\nby a slight shrug of his shoulders.

During these\nhours of profound meditation, which to him had seemed only minutes, he\nhad formed a fearful resolution, and bound himself to its fulfilment by\na solemn oath. Dantès was at length roused from his reverie by the voice of Faria,\nwho, having also been visited by his jailer, had come to invite his\nfellow-sufferer to share his supper. The reputation of being out of his\nmind, though harmlessly and even amusingly so, had procured for the\nabbé unusual privileges. He was supplied with bread of a finer, whiter\nquality than the usual prison fare, and even regaled each Sunday with a\nsmall quantity of wine. Now this was a Sunday, and the abbé had come to\nask his young companion to share the luxuries with him. Dantès followed him; his features were no longer contracted, and now\nwore their usual expression, but there was that in his whole appearance\nthat bespoke one who had come to a fixed and desperate resolve.

Barrois asked, “Mademoiselle Valentine?”\n\nNoirtier nodded his head. “She is at the ball, as you know, since she came to say good-bye to you\nin full dress.” Noirtier again closed his left eye. “Do you wish to see her?” Noirtier again made an affirmative sign. “Well, they have gone to fetch her, no doubt, from Madame de Morcerf’s;\nI will await her return, and beg her to come up here. Is that what you\nwish for?”\n\n“Yes,” replied the invalid. Barrois, therefore, as we have seen, watched for Valentine, and\ninformed her of her grandfather’s wish.

The old gentleman continued to dwell upon her with the same\nexpression. “Yes, yes,” said Valentine, “you mean that I have yet a kind\ngrandfather left, do you not.” The old man intimated that such was his\nmeaning. “Ah, yes, happily I have,” replied Valentine. “Without that,\nwhat would become of me?”\n\nIt was one o’clock in the morning. Barrois, who wished to go to bed\nhimself, observed that after such sad events everyone stood in need of\nrest.

You are crazy. Why, three days ago the emperor had not\nlanded.”\n\n“No matter, I was aware of his intention.”\n\n“How did you know about it?”\n\n“By a letter addressed to you from the Island of Elba.”\n\n“To me?”\n\n“To you; and which I discovered in the pocket-book of the messenger.

Shot, my dear boy? What an idea! Where is the letter you\nspeak of? I know you too well to suppose you would allow such a thing\nto pass you.”\n\n“I burnt it, for fear that even a fragment should remain; for that\nletter must have led to your condemnation.”\n\n“And the destruction of your future prospects,” replied Noirtier; “yes,\nI can easily comprehend that.", "similarity": 0.5460283756256104}, {"chunk_id": 37, "text": "He was—nay, probably may still be—a Bonapartist,\nand is called Noirtier; I, on the contrary, am a staunch royalist, and\nstyle myself de Villefort.

Thus Glenarvan extended his\nhand very cordially to his unexpected guest. \"And now that our introduction is over,\" added he, \"will you permit me,\nMonsieur Paganel, to ask you a question?\" \"Twenty, my lord,\" replied Jacques Paganel; \"it will always be a\npleasure to converse with you.\" \"You arrived on board this vessel the day before yesterday?\" \"Yes, my lord, day before yesterday, at eight o'clock in the evening. I took a cab from the Caledonian Railway to the Scotia, in which I had\nengaged cabin number six at Paris. The night was dark. I saw no one on\nboard.

The Frenchman, mistaking the vessel, had embarked while the crew of\nthe Duncan were engaged in the ceremony at Saint Mungo. Everything was\nexplained. But what would the geographer say, when he learned the name\nand destination of the vessel on which he had taken passage? \"So, Monsieur Paganel,\" said Glenarvan, \"you have chosen Calcutta as\nyour centre of action?\" \"Yes, my lord.

He spoke with a lofty animation, and was\ncarried away in the rapid flight of imagination. It would have been\nas impossible to check him as to stay the Rhine at the Falls of\nSchaffhausen. \"Monsieur Jacques Paganel,\" said Lord Glenarvan, after a moment\nof silence, \"that is certainly a fine voyage, and one for which\nscience would be very grateful; but I will not further prolong your\nignorance.

Besides, he set the example himself. \"Laugh, my friends,\" said he, \"laugh with a will! you cannot laugh as\nmuch as I do at myself.\" And he uttered the most formidable peal of laughter that ever issued\nfrom the mouth of a geographer. \"But we are none the less without an interpreter,\" said the major. \"Oh, do not be troubled,\" replied Paganel. \"The Portuguese and Spanish\nresemble each other so much that I made a mistake. However, this very\nresemblance will soon enable me to rectify my error, and in a short\ntime I will thank this worthy Patagonian in the language he speaks so\nwell.\" Paganel was right, for he could soon exchange a few words with the\nnative. He even learned that his name was Thalcave, a word which\nsignifies in Araucanian \"the thunderer.\" This surname was doubtless\ngiven to him for his skill in the use of fire-arms. [Sidenote: BETTER PROSPECTS.] But Glenarvan was particularly rejoiced to discover that the Patagonian\nwas a guide, and, moreover, a guide of the Pampas. There was,\ntherefore, something so providential in this meeting that the success\nof the enterprise seemed already an accomplished fact, and no one any\nlonger doubted the rescue of Captain Grant. In the meantime the travelers and the Patagonian had returned to\nRobert. The latter stretched his arms towards the native, who, without\na word, placed his hand upon his head. He examined the child and felt\nhis wounded limbs. Then, smiling, he went and gathered on the banks\nof the stream a few handfuls of wild celery, with which he rubbed the\nboy's body. Under this treatment, performed with an extreme gentleness,\nthe child felt his strength revive, and it was plain that a few hours\nwould suffice to restore him. It was therefore decided that that day and the following night should\nbe passed at the encampment. Besides, two important questions remained\nto be settled--food, and means of conveyance. Provisions and mules were\nboth wanting. Fortunately Thalcave solved the difficulty. This guide, who was\naccustomed to conduct travelers along the Patagonian frontiers, and\nwas one of the most intelligent baqueanos of the country, engaged to\nfurnish Glenarvan all that his little party needed. He offered to take\nhim to a \"tolderia\" (encampment) of Indians, about four miles distant,\nwhere they would find everything necessary for the expedition. This\nproposal was made partly by gestures, partly by Spanish words which\nPaganel succeeded in understanding. It was accepted, and Glenarvan and\nhis learned friend, taking leave of their companions, reascended the\nstream under the guidance of the Patagonian. They proceeded at a good pace for an hour and a half, taking long\nstrides to keep up to the giant Thalcave. All the region was charming,\nand of a rich fertility. The grassy pastures succeeded each other,\nand could easily have fed thousands of cattle. Large ponds, united by\na winding chain of streams, gave these plains a verdant moisture. Black-headed swans sported on the mirror-like surface, and disputed the\nempire of the waters with numberless ostriches that gamboled over the\nplains, while the brilliant feathered tribes were in wonderful variety.

The Patagonian then conducted them to an abandoned estancia. Here\na good fire was burning, which revived them, and on the coals were\nroasting succulent slices of venison, to which they did ample justice. And when their refreshed minds began to reflect, they could scarcely\nbelieve that they had escaped so many perils,--the fire, the water, and\nthe formidable alligators. Thalcave, in a few words, told his story to Paganel, and ascribed to\nhis intrepid horse all the honor of having saved him. Paganel then\nendeavored to explain to him the new interpretation of the document,\nand the hopes it led them to entertain. Did the Indian understand the\ngeographer's ingenious suppositions? It was very doubtful; but he saw\nhis friends happy and very confident, and he desired nothing more. It may be easily believed that these courageous travelers, after their\nday of rest on the tree, needed no urging to resume their journey. At\neight o'clock in the morning they were ready to start. They were too\nfar south to procure means of transport, and were therefore obliged\nto travel on foot. The distance, however, was only forty miles, and\nThaouka would not refuse to carry from time to time a tired pedestrian. In thirty-six hours they would reach the shores of the Atlantic. [Sidenote: IN THE DARK.] As soon as refreshed the guide and his companions left behind them\nthe immense basin, still covered with the waters, and proceeded across\nelevated plains, on which, here and there, were seen groves planted by\nEuropeans, meadows, and occasionally native trees. Thus the day passed. The next morning, fifteen miles before reaching the ocean, its\nproximity was perceptible. They hastened on in order to reach Lake\nSalado, on the shores of the Atlantic, the same day. They were\nbeginning to feel fatigued, when they perceived sand-hills that hid the\nfoaming waves, and soon the prolonged murmur of the rising tide struck\nupon their ears. \"The ocean!\" cried Paganel. \"Yes, the ocean!\" replied Thalcave. And these wanderers, whose strength had seemed almost about to fail,\nclimbed the mounds with wonderful agility. But the darkness was\nprofound, and their eyes wandered in vain over the gloomy expanse. They\nlooked for the Duncan, but could not discern her. \"She is there, at all events,\" said Glenarvan, \"waiting for us.\" \"We shall see her to-morrow,\" replied MacNabb. Tom Austin shouted seaward, but received no answer. The wind was very\nstrong, and the sea tempestuous. The clouds were driving from the west,\nand the foaming crests of the waves broke over the beach in masses of\nspray. If the Duncan was at the appointed rendezvous, the lookout man\ncould neither hear nor be heard. The coast afforded no shelter. There\nwas no bay, no harbor, no cove; not even a creek. The beach consisted\nof long sand-banks that were lost in the sea, and the vicinity of\nwhich is more dangerous than that of the rocks in the face of wind and\ntide. These banks, in fact, increase the waves; the sea is peculiarly\nboisterous around them, and ships are sure to be lost if they strike on\nthese bars in heavy storms. It was therefore very natural that the Duncan, considering this coast\ndangerous, and knowing it to be without a port of shelter, kept at a\ndistance. Captain Mangles must have kept to the windward as far as\npossible. This was Tom Austin's opinion, and he declared that the\nDuncan was not less than five miles at sea.", "similarity": 0.5135045051574707}, {"chunk_id": 9, "text": "Lord Edward Glenarvan was thirty-two years old.

He had been married scarcely three months, having espoused Miss Helena\nTuffnel, daughter of the great traveler, William Tuffnel, one of the\nnumerous victims to the great passion for geographical discoveries. Miss Helena did not belong to a noble family, but she was Scotch, which\nequaled all nobilities in the eyes of Lord Glenarvan. This charming\nyoung creature, high-minded and devoted, the lord of Luss had made the\ncompanion of his life. He found her one day living alone, an orphan,\nalmost without fortune, in the house of her father at Kilpatrick. He\nsaw that the poor girl would make a noble wife, and he married her.

She loved him as if\nshe had been the rich heiress, and he the friendless orphan. As to\ntheir tenants and servants, they were ready to lay down their lives for\nher whom they called \"our good lady of Luss.\" [Sidenote: LIFE IN THE SCOTTISH HOME.] Lord and Lady Glenarvan lived happily at Malcolm Castle, in the midst\nof the grand and wild scenery of the Highlands, rambling in the\nshady alleys of horse-chestnuts and sycamores, along the shores of\nthe lake, where still resounded the war cries of ancient times, or\nin the depths of those uncultivated gorges in which the history of\nScotland lies written in ruins from age to age. One day they would\nwander in the forests of beeches and larches, and in the midst of the\nmasses of heather; another, they would scale the precipitous summits\nof Ben Lomond, or traverse on horseback the solitary glens, studying,\ncomprehending, and admiring this poetic country, still called \"the land\nof Rob Roy,\" and all those celebrated sites so grandly sung by Walter\nScott. In the sweet, still evening, when the \"lantern of Mac Farlane\"\nillumined the horizon, they would stroll along the \"bartizans,\" an old\ncircular balcony that formed a chain of battlements to Malcolm Castle,\nand there, pensive, oblivious, and as if alone in the world, seated\non some detached rock, under the pale rays of the moon, while night\ngradually enveloped the rugged summits of the mountains, they would\ncontinue wrapt in that pure ecstasy and inward delight known only to\nloving hearts.

Besides, he set the example himself. \"Laugh, my friends,\" said he, \"laugh with a will! you cannot laugh as\nmuch as I do at myself.\" And he uttered the most formidable peal of laughter that ever issued\nfrom the mouth of a geographer. \"But we are none the less without an interpreter,\" said the major. \"Oh, do not be troubled,\" replied Paganel. \"The Portuguese and Spanish\nresemble each other so much that I made a mistake. However, this very\nresemblance will soon enable me to rectify my error, and in a short\ntime I will thank this worthy Patagonian in the language he speaks so\nwell.\" Paganel was right, for he could soon exchange a few words with the\nnative. He even learned that his name was Thalcave, a word which\nsignifies in Araucanian \"the thunderer.\" This surname was doubtless\ngiven to him for his skill in the use of fire-arms. [Sidenote: BETTER PROSPECTS.] But Glenarvan was particularly rejoiced to discover that the Patagonian\nwas a guide, and, moreover, a guide of the Pampas. There was,\ntherefore, something so providential in this meeting that the success\nof the enterprise seemed already an accomplished fact, and no one any\nlonger doubted the rescue of Captain Grant. In the meantime the travelers and the Patagonian had returned to\nRobert. The latter stretched his arms towards the native, who, without\na word, placed his hand upon his head. He examined the child and felt\nhis wounded limbs. Then, smiling, he went and gathered on the banks\nof the stream a few handfuls of wild celery, with which he rubbed the\nboy's body. Under this treatment, performed with an extreme gentleness,\nthe child felt his strength revive, and it was plain that a few hours\nwould suffice to restore him. It was therefore decided that that day and the following night should\nbe passed at the encampment. Besides, two important questions remained\nto be settled--food, and means of conveyance. Provisions and mules were\nboth wanting. Fortunately Thalcave solved the difficulty. This guide, who was\naccustomed to conduct travelers along the Patagonian frontiers, and\nwas one of the most intelligent baqueanos of the country, engaged to\nfurnish Glenarvan all that his little party needed. He offered to take\nhim to a \"tolderia\" (encampment) of Indians, about four miles distant,\nwhere they would find everything necessary for the expedition. This\nproposal was made partly by gestures, partly by Spanish words which\nPaganel succeeded in understanding. It was accepted, and Glenarvan and\nhis learned friend, taking leave of their companions, reascended the\nstream under the guidance of the Patagonian. They proceeded at a good pace for an hour and a half, taking long\nstrides to keep up to the giant Thalcave. All the region was charming,\nand of a rich fertility. The grassy pastures succeeded each other,\nand could easily have fed thousands of cattle. Large ponds, united by\na winding chain of streams, gave these plains a verdant moisture. Black-headed swans sported on the mirror-like surface, and disputed the\nempire of the waters with numberless ostriches that gamboled over the\nplains, while the brilliant feathered tribes were in wonderful variety.

The Patagonian then conducted them to an abandoned estancia. Here\na good fire was burning, which revived them, and on the coals were\nroasting succulent slices of venison, to which they did ample justice. And when their refreshed minds began to reflect, they could scarcely\nbelieve that they had escaped so many perils,--the fire, the water, and\nthe formidable alligators. Thalcave, in a few words, told his story to Paganel, and ascribed to\nhis intrepid horse all the honor of having saved him. Paganel then\nendeavored to explain to him the new interpretation of the document,\nand the hopes it led them to entertain. Did the Indian understand the\ngeographer's ingenious suppositions? It was very doubtful; but he saw\nhis friends happy and very confident, and he desired nothing more. It may be easily believed that these courageous travelers, after their\nday of rest on the tree, needed no urging to resume their journey. At\neight o'clock in the morning they were ready to start. They were too\nfar south to procure means of transport, and were therefore obliged\nto travel on foot. The distance, however, was only forty miles, and\nThaouka would not refuse to carry from time to time a tired pedestrian. In thirty-six hours they would reach the shores of the Atlantic. [Sidenote: IN THE DARK.] As soon as refreshed the guide and his companions left behind them\nthe immense basin, still covered with the waters, and proceeded across\nelevated plains, on which, here and there, were seen groves planted by\nEuropeans, meadows, and occasionally native trees. Thus the day passed. The next morning, fifteen miles before reaching the ocean, its\nproximity was perceptible. They hastened on in order to reach Lake\nSalado, on the shores of the Atlantic, the same day. They were\nbeginning to feel fatigued, when they perceived sand-hills that hid the\nfoaming waves, and soon the prolonged murmur of the rising tide struck\nupon their ears. \"The ocean!\" cried Paganel. \"Yes, the ocean!\" replied Thalcave. And these wanderers, whose strength had seemed almost about to fail,\nclimbed the mounds with wonderful agility. But the darkness was\nprofound, and their eyes wandered in vain over the gloomy expanse. They\nlooked for the Duncan, but could not discern her. \"She is there, at all events,\" said Glenarvan, \"waiting for us.\" \"We shall see her to-morrow,\" replied MacNabb. Tom Austin shouted seaward, but received no answer. The wind was very\nstrong, and the sea tempestuous. The clouds were driving from the west,\nand the foaming crests of the waves broke over the beach in masses of\nspray. If the Duncan was at the appointed rendezvous, the lookout man\ncould neither hear nor be heard. The coast afforded no shelter. There\nwas no bay, no harbor, no cove; not even a creek. The beach consisted\nof long sand-banks that were lost in the sea, and the vicinity of\nwhich is more dangerous than that of the rocks in the face of wind and\ntide. These banks, in fact, increase the waves; the sea is peculiarly\nboisterous around them, and ships are sure to be lost if they strike on\nthese bars in heavy storms. It was therefore very natural that the Duncan, considering this coast\ndangerous, and knowing it to be without a port of shelter, kept at a\ndistance. Captain Mangles must have kept to the windward as far as\npossible. This was Tom Austin's opinion, and he declared that the\nDuncan was not less than five miles at sea.", "similarity": 0.5677677392959595}, {"chunk_id": 34, "text": "What course shall we take?\" \"An easy and agreeable one,\" replied Paganel. \"A few mountains to begin\nwith; then a gentle descent on the eastern slope of the Andes; and at\nlast a level, grassy, sandy plain, a real garden.\" \"Let us see the map,\" said the major. \"Here it is, my dear MacNabb. We shall begin at the end of the\nthirty-seventh parallel on the coast of Chili. After passing through\nthe capital of Araucania, we shall strike the Cordilleras, and\ndescending their steep declivities across the Rio Colorado, we shall\nreach the Pampas. Passing the frontiers of Buenos Ayres, we shall\ncontinue our search until we reach the shores of the Atlantic.\" [Sidenote: A STROLL ACROSS THE COUNTRY.] Thus speaking and developing the programme of the expedition, Paganel\ndid not even take the trouble to look at the map spread before him. And he had no need to; educated in the schools of Frézier, Molina,\nHumboldt, and Miers, his unerring memory could neither be deceived nor\nbaffled. After finishing his plan, he added:\n\n\"Therefore, my dear friends, the course is straight. In thirty days we\nshall accomplish it, and arrive before the Duncan on the eastern shore,\nsince the westerly winds will delay her progress.\" \"The Duncan then,\" said Captain Mangles, \"will cross the thirty-seventh\nparallel between Cape Corrientes and Cape St. Antonio?\" \"Exactly.\" \"And whom would you constitute the members of such an expedition?\" asked Glenarvan. \"The fewer the better. The only point is to ascertain the situation of\nCaptain Grant, and not to engage in combat with the Indians. I think\nthat Lord Glenarvan, as our chief, the major, who would yield his place\nto no one, your servant Jacques Paganel----\"\n\n\"And I!\" cried Robert Grant. \"Robert?\" said Mary. \"And why not?\" answered Paganel. \"Travels develop youth. We four, then,\nand three sailors of the Duncan----\"\n\n\"What,\" exclaimed Captain Mangles, \"your lordship does not intercede\nfor me?\" \"My dear fellow,\" replied Glenarvan, \"we shall leave the ladies on\nboard, the dearest objects we have in the world. Who would watch over\nthem, if not the devoted captain of the Duncan?\" \"We cannot accompany you, then,\" said Lady Helena, whose eyes were\ndimmed by a mist of sadness. \"My dear wife,\" replied Glenarvan, \"our journey will be performed with\nunusual rapidity, our separation will be short, and----\"\n\n[Illustration: The mate, Tom Austin, Wilson, a powerful fellow, and\nMulready, were the fortunate ones.] [Sidenote: GOOD AFTERNOON!] \"Yes, yes; I understand you,\" answered Lady Helena. \"Go, then, and may\nyou succeed in your enterprise.\" \"Besides, this is not a journey,\" added Paganel. \"What is it, then?\" asked Lady Helena. \"A passage, nothing more. We shall pass, that is all, like honest\nmen, over the country and do all the good possible. '_Transire\nbenefaciendo_' is our motto.\" With these words the discussion ended. The preparations were begun that\nvery day, and it was resolved to keep the expedition secret, in order\nnot to alarm the Indians. The 14th of October was fixed for the day of\ndeparture. When they came to choose the sailors who were to go, they all offered\ntheir services, and Glenarvan was forced to make a choice. He preferred\nto have them draw lots, that he might not mortify such brave men.

There is something so awe-inspiring in great afflictions\nthat even in the worst times the first emotion of a crowd has generally\nbeen to sympathize with the sufferer in a great catastrophe. Many\npeople have been assassinated in a tumult, but even criminals have\nrarely been insulted during trial. Thus Villefort passed through the\nmass of spectators and officers of the Palais, and withdrew. Though he\nhad acknowledged his guilt, he was protected by his grief.

In the clover-fields beyond the chestnut-trees, a lark\nwas mounting up to heaven, while pouring out her clear morning song.

The next day, Monday, was the first sitting of the assizes. The morning\ndawned dull and gloomy, and Villefort saw the dim gray light shine upon\nthe lines he had traced in red ink. The magistrate had slept for a\nshort time while the lamp sent forth its final struggles; its\nflickerings awoke him, and he found his fingers as damp and purple as\nthough they had been dipped in blood. He opened the window; a bright yellow streak crossed the sky, and\nseemed to divide in half the poplars, which stood out in black relief\non the horizon. In the clover-fields beyond the chestnut-trees, a lark\nwas mounting up to heaven, while pouring out her clear morning song. The damps of the dew bathed the head of Villefort, and refreshed his\nmemory. “Today,” he said with an effort,—“today the man who holds the blade of\njustice must strike wherever there is guilt.”\n\nInvoluntarily his eyes wandered towards the window of Noirtier’s room,\nwhere he had seen him the preceding night. The curtain was drawn, and\nyet the image of his father was so vivid to his mind that he addressed\nthe closed window as though it had been open, and as if through the\nopening he had beheld the menacing old man. “Yes,” he murmured,—“yes, be satisfied.”\n\nHis head dropped upon his chest, and in this position he paced his\nstudy; then he threw himself, dressed as he was, upon a sofa, less to\nsleep than to rest his limbs, cramped with cold and study. By degrees\neveryone awoke. Villefort, from his study, heard the successive noises\nwhich accompany the life of a house,—the opening and shutting of doors,\nthe ringing of Madame de Villefort’s bell, to summon the waiting-maid,\nmingled with the first shouts of the child, who rose full of the\nenjoyment of his age. Villefort also rang; his new valet brought him\nthe papers, and with them a cup of chocolate. “What are you bringing me?” said he. “A cup of chocolate.”\n\n“I did not ask for it.

The only\ndifference consists in the opposite character of the equality advocated\nby these two men; one is the equality that elevates, the other is the\nequality that degrades; one brings a king within reach of the\nguillotine, the other elevates the people to a level with the throne. Observe,” said Villefort, smiling, “I do not mean to deny that both\nthese men were revolutionary scoundrels, and that the 9th Thermidor and\nthe 4th of April, in the year 1814, were lucky days for France, worthy\nof being gratefully remembered by every friend to monarchy and civil\norder; and that explains how it comes to pass that, fallen, as I trust\nhe is forever, Napoleon has still retained a train of parasitical\nsatellites. Still, marquise, it has been so with other\nusurpers—Cromwell, for instance, who was not half so bad as Napoleon,\nhad his partisans and advocates.”\n\n“Do you know, Villefort, that you are talking in a most dreadfully\nrevolutionary strain? But I excuse it, it is impossible to expect the\nson of a Girondin to be free from a small spice of the old leaven.” A\ndeep crimson suffused the countenance of Villefort. “’Tis true, madame,” answered he, “that my father was a Girondin, but\nhe was not among the number of those who voted for the king’s death; he\nwas an equal sufferer with yourself during the Reign of Terror, and had\nwell-nigh lost his head on the same scaffold on which your father\nperished.”\n\n“True,” replied the marquise, without wincing in the slightest degree\nat the tragic remembrance thus called up; “but bear in mind, if you\nplease, that our respective parents underwent persecution and\nproscription from diametrically opposite principles; in proof of which\nI may remark, that while my family remained among the staunchest\nadherents of the exiled princes, your father lost no time in joining\nthe new government; and that while the Citizen Noirtier was a Girondin,\nthe Count Noirtier became a senator.”\n\n“Dear mother,” interposed Renée, “you know very well it was agreed that\nall these disagreeable reminiscences should forever be laid aside.”\n\n“Suffer me, also, madame,” replied Villefort, “to add my earnest\nrequest to Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran’s, that you will kindly allow\nthe veil of oblivion to cover and conceal the past. What avails\nrecrimination over matters wholly past recall? For my own part, I have\nlaid aside even the name of my father, and altogether disown his\npolitical principles.

And in my past life they might find something far more grave\nthan the selling of smuggled cigars, or barrels of brandy without a\npermit.

Two days after this conversation, Captain Mangles took an observation,\nand the passengers saw, to their great satisfaction, upon consulting\nthe map, that they were in the vicinity of Cape Bernouilli, which\nthey might expect to reach in four days. The west wind had hitherto\nfavored the progress of the yacht, but for several days it had shown a\ntendency to fail, and now there was a perfect calm. The sails flapped\nidly against the masts, and had it not been for her powerful screw, the\nDuncan would have been becalmed on the ocean. [Sidenote: FOREBODINGS OF DISASTER.] This state of things might be prolonged indefinitely. At evening\nGlenarvan consulted the captain on the subject. The latter, whose\nsupply of coal was rapidly diminishing, appeared much disturbed at the\nsubsidence of the wind. He had covered his ship with canvas, and set\nhis studding- and main-sails, that he might take advantage of the least\nbreeze; but, in nautical language, there was not enough wind \"to fill a\nhat.\" \"At all events,\" said Glenarvan, \"we need not complain. It is better to\nbe without wind than to have a contrary one.\" \"Your lordship is right,\" replied Captain Mangles; \"but I dread some\nsudden change in the weather. We are now in the neighborhood of the\ntrade-winds, which, from October to April, blow from the northeast, and\nour progress will, therefore, be very much retarded.\" \"But what can we do, captain? If this misfortune occurs, we must submit\nto it. It will only be a delay, after all.\" \"Probably, if a storm does not come upon us too.\" \"Do you fear bad weather?\" asked Glenarvan, looking at the sky, which,\nhowever, was cloudless. \"Yes,\" replied the captain. \"I tell your lordship, but would conceal my\napprehensions from Lady Helena and Miss Grant.\" \"You act wisely. What do you apprehend?\" \"There are signs of a great storm. Do not trust the appearance of the\nsky, my lord; nothing is more deceptive. For two days the barometer\nhas fallen to an alarming degree. This is a warning that I cannot\ndisregard.

Let the storm come; we will take care of\nourselves.\" Captain Mangles, while giving expression to his fears, was by no means\nforgetful of his duty as a sailor.", "similarity": 0.45106834173202515}, {"chunk_id": 177, "text": "\"What a stupid fellow!\" was their first remark. \"Well, I like him,\" replied Paganel. \"He is a real sea-wolf.\" \"A real bear!\" remarked the major. \"And I imagine,\" added Captain Mangles, \"that this bear has at some\ntime traded in human flesh.\" \"What matter,\" replied Glenarvan, \"so long as he commands the\nMacquarie, which goes to New Zealand? We shall see very little of him\non the voyage.\" Lady Helena and Mary Grant were very much pleased to know that they\nwere to start the next day. Glenarvan observed, however, that the\nMacquarie could not equal the Duncan for comfort; but, after so many\nhardships, they were not likely to be overcome by trifles. Mr. Olbinett\nwas requested to take charge of the provisions. The poor man, since the\nloss of the Duncan, had often lamented the unhappy fate of his wife,\nwho had remained on board, and would be, consequently, the victim of\nthe convicts' brutality. However, he fulfilled his duties as steward\nwith his accustomed zeal, and their food might yet consist of dishes\nthat were never seen on the ship's table. In the mean time the major discounted at a money-changer's some drafts\nthat Glenarvan had on the Union Bank of Melbourne. As for Paganel, he\nprocured an excellent map of New Zealand. Mulready was now quite well. He scarcely felt his wound, which had so\nnearly proved fatal. A few hours at sea would complete his recovery. [Illustration: The landlord of Victoria Hotel furnished them with two\nhorses, and they set out.] Wilson went on board first, charged with arranging the passengers'\nquarters. Under his vigorous use of the brush and broom the aspect\nof things was greatly changed. Will Halley shrugged his shoulders,\nbut allowed the sailor to do as he pleased. As for Glenarvan and his\nfriends, he scarcely noticed them; he did not even know their names,\nnor did he care to. This increase of cargo was worth fifty pounds to\nhim, but he valued it less than the two hundred tons of tanned leather\nwith which his hold was crowded,--the skins first, and the passengers\nnext. He was a real trader; and by his nautical ability he passed for a\ngood navigator of these seas, rendered so very dangerous by the coral\nreefs. During the afternoon, Glenarvan wished to visit once more the supposed\nplace of the shipwreck. Ayrton had certainly been the quartermaster of\nthe Britannia, and the vessel might really have been lost on that part\nof the coast. And there, at all events, the Duncan had fallen into the\nhands of the convicts. Had there been a fight? Perhaps they would find\non the beach traces of a struggle. If the crew had perished in the\nwaves, would not the bodies have been cast ashore? Glenarvan, accompanied by his faithful captain, undertook this\nexamination. The landlord of Victoria Hotel furnished them with two\nhorses, and they set out. But it was a sad journey. They rode in\nsilence. The same thoughts, the same anxieties, tortured the mind of\neach. They gazed at the rocks worn by the sea. They had no need to\nquestion or answer; no sign of the Duncan could be found,--the whole\ncoast was bare. Captain Mangles, however, found on the margin of the shore evident\nsigns of an encampment, the remains of fires recently kindled beneath\nthe few trees. Had a wandering tribe of natives passed there within\na few days? No, for an object struck Glenarvan's eye, which proved\nincontestably that the convicts had visited that part of the coast.

The major was the first to resume the examination, in order to\ndetermine the dates relative to the Britannia. \"It was the 8th of April, 1862, then, that you were landed on the west\ncoast of Australia?\" he asked of the quartermaster. \"Exactly,\" replied Ayrton. \"And do you know what Captain Grant's plans were then?\" \"Vaguely.\" \"Continue, Ayrton,\" said Glenarvan. \"The least sign may set us on the\ntrack.\" \"What I can say is this, my lord. Captain Grant intended to visit New\nZealand. But this part of his programme was not carried out while I was\non board. The Britannia might, therefore, after leaving Callao, have\ngained the shores of New Zealand. This would agree with the date, June\n27, 1862, given in the document as the time of the shipwreck.\" \"Evidently,\" remarked Paganel. \"But,\" added Glenarvan, \"there is nothing in these half-obliterated\nportions of the document which can apply to New Zealand.\" \"That I cannot answer,\" said the quartermaster. \"Well, Ayrton,\" continued Glenarvan, \"you have kept your word, and I\nwill keep mine. We will decide on what island of the Pacific you shall\nbe abandoned.\" \"Oh, it matters little to me,\" answered Ayrton. \"Return to your cabin now, and await our decision.\" The quartermaster retired, under guard of the two sailors. \"This villain might have been a great man,\" observed the major. \"Yes,\" replied Glenarvan. \"He has a strong and self-reliant character. Why must his abilities be devoted to crime?\" \"But Harry Grant?\" \"I fear that he is forever lost! Poor children! who could tell them\nwhere their father is?\" \"I!\" cried Paganel. As we have remarked, the geographer, although so loquacious and\nexcitable usually, had scarcely spoken during Ayrton's examination. He\nhad listened in total silence. But this last word that he had uttered\nwas worth more than all the others, and startled Glenarvan at once. \"You, Paganel!\" he exclaimed; \"do you know where Captain Grant is?\" \"As well as can be known,\" answered the geographer. \"And how do you know?\" \"By that everlasting document.\" [Sidenote: A GEOGRAPHER'S REMINISCENCES.] \"Ah!\" said the major, in a tone of the most thorough incredulity. \"Listen first, MacNabb, and shrug your shoulders afterwards. I did\nnot speak before, because you would not have believed me. Besides, it\nwas useless. But if I speak to-day, it is because Ayrton's opinion\ncorroborates mine.\" \"Then New Zealand----?\" asked Glenarvan. \"Hear and judge,\" replied Paganel. \"I did not commit the blunder\nthat saved us, without reason. Just as I was writing that letter\nat Glenarvan's dictation, the word Zealand was troubling my brain. You remember that we were in the cart.

However, he did not breathe a word of his personal suspicions,\nbut contented himself with exploring the surroundings of the river,\nwhose tranquillity was undisturbed. As for Glenarvan, his only fear was\nto see Ayrton return alone. In the absence of skilled labor, the cart\ncould not resume its journey, which would be interrupted for several\ndays perhaps; and his longings for success and eagerness to attain his\nend admitted of no delay. Fortunately, Ayrton had lost neither his time nor his trouble. The\nnext morning he reappeared at break of day. A man accompanied him, by\nprofession a farrier. He was a tall, stout fellow, but of a low and\nbrutish appearance, which did not prepossess one in his favor. However,\nthis was of little importance, if he knew his business. At all events\nhis breath was not wasted in idle words. \"Is he an efficient workman?\" inquired Captain Mangles of the\nquartermaster. \"I know no more than you, captain,\" replied Ayrton. \"We shall see.\" The farrier began his work. He was a man who understood his trade, as\none could see by the way in which he repaired the wheels of the cart. He labored skillfully and with uncommon energy. During the operation, the major noticed that the farrier's wrists were\nconsiderably eroded, and that they were each encircled by a blackish\nring of extravasated blood. These were the marks of recent wounds,\nwhich the sleeves of a miserable woolen shirt but partially concealed. MacNabb questioned the man about these erosions, which must have been\nvery painful. He, however, made no reply, but stolidly kept on at his\nwork. Two hours after, the injuries of the cart were repaired. As for\nGlenarvan's horse, he was quickly shod. The farrier had taken care to\nbring shoes all prepared. There was a peculiarity about them, however,\nwhich did not escape the major. It was a trefoil rudely carved on the\nouter rim. He pointed it out to Ayrton. \"It is the Black Point mark,\" replied the quartermaster, \"which enables\nthem to follow the tracks of the horses that stray from the station,\nand not confound them with others.\" The farrier, having done all that was required of him, now claimed his\nwages, and departed without having spoken four words. Half an hour later, the travelers were on the move. Beyond the curtain\nof mimosas extended a broad, uncovered space, which justly deserved its\nname of \"open plain.\" Fragments of quartz and ferruginous rocks lay\namong the bushes, tall grass, and hedgerows that protected numerous\nflocks.", "similarity": 0.4669497013092041}]}

Of what use can\nhe be?\" \"To give us the information we need for our journey,\" replied\nGlenarvan. \"Let us go in.\" Glenarvan, followed by Ayrton, entered the tavern. The landlord of\n\"Bush Inn\" was a coarse man, of forbidding appearance, who had to\nconsider himself as the principal customer for the gin, brandy, and\nwhisky of his tavern, and scarcely ever saw any one but squatters or\nherdsmen. He replied in an ill-humored way to the questions that were addressed\nhim; but his answers sufficed to determine Ayrton upon his course. Glenarvan, however, remunerated the tavern-keeper for the little\ntrouble they had given him, and was about to leave the inn, when a\nplacard, affixed to the wall, attracted his attention. It was a notice\nof the colonial police, detailing the escape of the convicts from\nPerth, and setting a price upon the head of Ben Joyce--a hundred pounds\nsterling to any one who should deliver him up. \"Indeed,\" said Glenarvan, \"that is a rascal worth hanging.\" \"And especially worth taking,\" replied Ayrton. \"A hundred pounds! What\na sum! He is not worth it.\" \"As for the inn-keeper,\" added Glenarvan, as he left the room, \"I\nscarcely put faith in him, despite his placard.\" \"Nor I either,\" said Ayrton. Glenarvan and the quartermaster rejoined the party, and they all\nproceeded to where a narrow pass wound across the chain. Here they\nbegan the ascent. [Sidenote: ANOTHER DEATH.] But it was an arduous task. More than once the ladies and their\ncompanions had to dismount, and it was often necessary to push the\nwheels of the heavy vehicle at some steep ascent, or to hold it\nback along the edge of some dangerous precipice. The oxen, as they\ncould not work to advantage at sudden turns, had frequently to be\nunyoked, and the cart blocked to prevent it from sliding back. Ayrton\nwas repeatedly forced to bring the already exhausted horses to his\nassistance. Whether this exertion was too prolonged, or whether from some other\ncause, one of the horses gave out during the ascent. He fell suddenly,\nwithout an instant's warning. It was Mulready's horse; and when the\nsailor attempted to help him up, he found that he was dead. Ayrton\nexamined the animal carefully, but did not seem to understand the cause\nof this sudden death. \"The beast must have burst a blood-vessel,\" said Glenarvan. \"Evidently,\" replied Ayrton. \"Take my horse, Mulready,\" added Glenarvan; \"I will join Lady Helena in\nthe cart.\" Mulready obeyed, and the little party continued their fatiguing ascent,\nabandoning the body to the crows. The next day they began the descent, which was much more rapid. During\nits course a violent hail-storm burst on them, and they were forced to\nseek a shelter beneath the rocks. Not hailstones, but pieces of ice as\nlarge as one's hand, were precipitated from the angry clouds. A sling\ncould not have hurled them with greater force, and several sharp blows\nwarned Paganel and Robert to be on their guard.

The major was the first to resume the examination, in order to\ndetermine the dates relative to the Britannia. \"It was the 8th of April, 1862, then, that you were landed on the west\ncoast of Australia?\" he asked of the quartermaster. \"Exactly,\" replied Ayrton. \"And do you know what Captain Grant's plans were then?\" \"Vaguely.\" \"Continue, Ayrton,\" said Glenarvan. \"The least sign may set us on the\ntrack.\" \"What I can say is this, my lord. Captain Grant intended to visit New\nZealand. But this part of his programme was not carried out while I was\non board.

The change that\nhad come over Villefort during the examination, the destruction of the\nletter, the exacted promise, the almost supplicating tones of the\nmagistrate, who seemed rather to implore mercy than to pronounce\npunishment,—all returned with a stunning force to his memory.

Napoleon would, doubtless, have deprived Villefort of his office had it\nnot been for Noirtier, who was all powerful at court, and thus the\nGirondin of ’93 and the Senator of 1806 protected him who so lately had\nbeen his protector. All Villefort’s influence barely enabled him to\nstifle the secret Dantès had so nearly divulged. The king’s procureur\nalone was deprived of his office, being suspected of royalism. However, scarcely was the imperial power established—that is, scarcely\nhad the emperor re-entered the Tuileries and begun to issue orders from\nthe closet into which we have introduced our readers,—he found on the\ntable there Louis XVIII.’s half-filled snuff-box,—scarcely had this\noccurred when Marseilles began, in spite of the authorities, to\nrekindle the flames of civil war, always smouldering in the south, and\nit required but little to excite the populace to acts of far greater\nviolence than the shouts and insults with which they assailed the\nroyalists whenever they ventured abroad. 0159m\n\n\n\nOwing to this change, the worthy shipowner became at that moment—we\nwill not say all powerful, because Morrel was a prudent and rather a\ntimid man, so much so, that many of the most zealous partisans of\nBonaparte accused him of “moderation”—but sufficiently influential to\nmake a demand in favor of Dantès. Villefort retained his place, but his marriage was put off until a more\nfavorable opportunity. If the emperor remained on the throne, Gérard\nrequired a different alliance to aid his career; if Louis XVIII. returned, the influence of M. de Saint-Méran, like his own, could be\nvastly increased, and the marriage be still more suitable. The deputy\nprocureur was, therefore, the first magistrate of Marseilles, when one\nmorning his door opened, and M. Morrel was announced. Anyone else would have hastened to receive him; but Villefort was a man\nof ability, and he knew this would be a sign of weakness. He made\nMorrel wait in the antechamber, although he had no one with him, for\nthe simple reason that the king’s procureur always makes everyone wait,\nand after passing a quarter of an hour in reading the papers, he\nordered M.

The Palais\nde Justice communicated with the prison,—a sombre edifice, that from\nits grated windows looks on the clock-tower of the Accoules.

The door opened, the two\ngendarmes gently pushed him forward, and the door closed with a loud\nsound behind him. The air he inhaled was no longer pure, but thick and\nmephitic,—he was in prison.

Those who had kept\ntheir shares, or bought those of Danglars, looked upon themselves as\nruined, and passed a very bad night. Next morning _Le Moniteur_\ncontained the following:\n\n“It was without any foundation that _Le Messager_ yesterday announced\nthe flight of Don Carlos and the revolt of Barcelona. The king (Don\nCarlos) has not left Bourges, and the peninsula is in the enjoyment of\nprofound peace.

Ha, ha, ha!” and a frightful, demoniac laugh\nfinished the sentence, which was lost in a hoarse rattle. Madame de Villefort fell at her husband’s feet. He approached her. “Think of it, madame,” he said; “if, on my return, justice has not been\nsatisfied, I will denounce you with my own mouth, and arrest you with\nmy own hands!”\n\nShe listened, panting, overwhelmed, crushed; her eye alone lived, and\nglared horribly. “Do you understand me?” he said. “I am going down there to pronounce\nthe sentence of death against a murderer. If I find you alive on my\nreturn, you shall sleep tonight in the conciergerie.”\n\nMadame de Villefort sighed; her nerves gave way, and she sunk on the\ncarpet. The king’s attorney seemed to experience a sensation of pity;\nhe looked upon her less severely, and, bowing to her, said slowly:\n\n“Farewell, madame, farewell!”\n\nThat farewell struck Madame de Villefort like the executioner’s knife. She fainted. The procureur went out, after having double-locked the\ndoor. Chapter 109.

Frequenting the Café de\nParis, the Boulevard de Gand, and the Bois de Boulogne, during his\nbrief career of splendor, the false Cavalcanti had formed a host of\nacquaintances. The papers had related his various adventures, both as\nthe man of fashion and the galley-slave; and as everyone who had been\npersonally acquainted with Prince Andrea Cavalcanti experienced a\nlively curiosity in his fate, they all determined to spare no trouble\nin endeavoring to witness the trial of M. Benedetto for the murder of\nhis comrade in chains. In the eyes of many, Benedetto appeared, if not a victim to, at least\nan instance of, the fallibility of the law. M.

Midnight struck slowly and sadly; every hour seemed to\nstrike with leaden weight upon the heart of the poor girl. “Valentine,” said the count, “summon up all your courage; still the\nbeatings of your heart; do not let a sound escape you, and feign to be\nasleep; then you will see.”\n\nValentine seized the count’s hand. “I think I hear a noise,” she said;\n“leave me.”\n\n“Good-bye, for the present,” replied the count, walking upon tiptoe\ntowards the library door, and smiling with an expression so sad and\npaternal that the young girl’s heart was filled with gratitude.

Then Valentine’s attention was engrossed by the clock in her\nroom, which marked the seconds. She began counting them, remarking that\nthey were much slower than the beatings of her heart; and still she\ndoubted,—the inoffensive Valentine could not imagine that anyone should\ndesire her death.

While Madame de Villefort remained rooted to the spot like a statue of\nterror, and Villefort, with his head hidden in the bedclothes, saw\nnothing around him, d’Avrigny approached the window, that he might the\nbetter examine the contents of the glass, and dipping the tip of his\nfinger in, tasted it. “Ah,” he exclaimed, “it is no longer brucine that is used; let me see\nwhat it is!”\n\nThen he ran to one of the cupboards in Valentine’s room, which had been\ntransformed into a medicine closet, and taking from its silver case a\nsmall bottle of nitric acid, dropped a little of it into the liquor,\nwhich immediately changed to a blood-red color. “Ah,” exclaimed d’Avrigny, in a voice in which the horror of a judge\nunveiling the truth was mingled with the delight of a student making a\ndiscovery.

Morrel had no particular reason\nfor uneasiness; Monte Cristo had promised him that Valentine should\nlive, and so far he had always fulfilled his word. Every night the\ncount had given him news, which was the next morning confirmed by\nNoirtier. Still this extraordinary silence appeared strange to him, and\nhe called a second and third time; still no answer. Then he determined\nto go up. Noirtier’s room was opened, like all the rest.

He\nunderstood what was passing in her mind. \"Miss Mary!\" cried he, \"you are weeping!\" \"What is the matter, my child?\" asked Lady Helena. \"My father, madam, my father!\" replied the young girl.

Ayrton soon made his appearance. He crossed the deck with a confident\nstep, and ascended the poop-stairs. His eyes had a sullen look, his\nteeth were set, and his fists clinched convulsively. His bearing\ndisplayed neither exultation nor humility. As soon as he was in Lord\nGlenarvan's presence, he folded his arms, and calmly and silently\nwaited to be questioned:\n\n\"Ayrton,\" said Glenarvan, \"here we all are, as you see, on board the\nDuncan, that you would have surrendered to Ben Joyce's accomplices.\" At these words the lips of the quartermaster slightly trembled.", "similarity": 0.5865719318389893}, {"chunk_id": 170, "text": "By the flash of\nthe report, he recognized Ben Joyce, but that was all.

I will find means to bring you on board. With the\ncrew once at sea, and a vessel like the Duncan, we shall be masters\nof the Indian Ocean.' 'Hurrah for Ben Joyce!' cried the convicts. Mulready's horse was then led up, and Ben Joyce disappeared at a gallop\non the Lucknow road, while the band proceeded southeastward to the\nSnowy River.

These two courageous\nmen accordingly, well furnished with arms and provisions, set out, and\nsoon disappeared among the tall rushes of the river. [Illustration: The animal reared.

I remember that his poncho flapped in my face.\" \"And where were you situated in reference to us?\" \"On the left also.\" \"Then Robert could have disappeared only on this side,\" said the major,\nturning towards the mountain, and pointing to the right. \"And also\nconsidering the time that has elapsed since his disappearance, the\nchild must have fallen at a high part of the mountain.

[Sidenote: A SLEEPLESS NIGHT.] All this portion of the Andes, except a few inaccessible plateaus,\nwas carefully explored for many hours without one of these brave men\nthinking of rest. But it was a vain search. The child had not only\nfound death in the mountains, but also a tomb, the stone of which,\nmade of some enormous rock, was forever closed over him. Towards noon Glenarvan and his companions, bruised and exhausted, found\nthemselves again in the valley. The former was a prey to the most\nviolent grief. He scarcely spoke, and from his lips issued only these\nwords, broken by sighs,--\"I will not go; I will not go!\" Each understood this determination, and respected it. \"We will wait,\" said Paganel to the major and Tom Austin. \"Let us take\nsome rest, and recruit our strength. We shall need it, whether to begin\nour search or continue our journey.\" \"Yes,\" replied MacNabb, \"let us remain, since Edward wishes it.

At length, however, there were various signs that they were approaching\nthe sea; by-and-by they reached the bank of a river which flows into\nthe Gulf of Carpentaria; and finally Burke and Wills, after terrible\nhardships, arrived at the point where the sea-water flowed up to and\ninundated the marshes, though the sea-shore itself they did not reach. With naught but barrenness in sight on either hand, their great desire\nwas to get back and rejoin their companions; but peril after peril\nawaited them, many of which their note-book has preserved an account\nof, but many more will be forever unrecorded. The three survivors\n(for one of the party had succumbed to the hardships) now strained\nevery effort to reach the encampment, where they hoped to find their\ncompanions and a store of provisions. On the 21st of April they\ngained the goal, but the prize was missing; only seven hours before,\nafter five months of waiting in vain, their companions had taken\ntheir departure. Of course nothing remained but to follow them with\ntheir feeble strength and scanty means of subsistence; but calamities\nstill dogged their footsteps, and at last the leader, Burke, lay down\nexhausted, saying to his companion, King, \"I have not many hours to\nlive; here are my watch and my notes; when I am dead, place a pistol\nin my right hand, and leave me without burial.\" His forebodings were\nrealized, and the next morning he died.

A CRY IN THE NIGHT. The crew soon learned that Ayrton's disclosures had not thrown light\nupon the situation of Captain Grant. The despair on board was profound,\nfor they had relied on the quartermaster, who, however, knew nothing\nthat could put the Duncan on the track of the Britannia. The yacht\ntherefore continued on the same course, and the only question now was\nto choose the island on which to leave Ayrton. Paganel and Captain Mangles consulted the maps on board. Exactly on\nthe thirty-seventh parallel was an island, generally known by the\nname of Maria Theresa, a lone rock in the midst of the Pacific, three\nthousand five hundred miles from the American coast, and one thousand\nfive hundred miles from New Zealand. No ship ever came within hail of\nthis solitary isle; no tidings from the world ever reached it. Only the\nstorm-birds rested here during their long flights, and many maps do not\neven indicate its position. If anywhere absolute isolation was to be found on earth, it was here,\nafar from the ocean's traveled highways. Its situation was made known\nto Ayrton, who consented to live there; and the vessel was accordingly\nheaded towards the island. Two days later the lookout hailed land on\nthe horizon. It was Maria Theresa, low, long, and scarcely emerging\nfrom the waves, appearing like some enormous sea-monster. Thirty miles\nstill lay between it and the yacht, whose prow cut the waves with\nsuch speed that soon the island grew distinct. The sun, now sinking\ntowards the west, defined its outlines in glowing light. Several slight\nelevations were tinged with the last rays of the day. At five o'clock Captain Mangles thought he distinguished a faint smoke\nrising towards the sky. \"Is that a volcano?\" he inquired of Paganel, who, with his telescope,\nwas examining the land. \"I do not know what to think,\" replied the geographer. \"Maria Theresa\nis a point little known. However, I should not be surprised if its\norigin was due to some volcanic upheaval.\" \"But then,\" said Glenarvan, \"if an eruption created it, may we not fear\nthat the same agency will destroy it?\" \"That is scarcely probable,\" answered Paganel. \"Its existence has\nbeen known for several centuries; and this seems a guarantee for its\ncontinuance.\" \"Well,\" continued Glenarvan, \"do you think, captain, that we can land\nbefore night?\" [Sidenote: ANOTHER ARTIFICIAL VOLCANO.] \"No, certainly not. I ought not to endanger the Duncan in the darkness,\non a coast that is not familiar to me. I will keep a short distance\nfrom land, and to-morrow at daybreak we will send a boat ashore.\" At eight o'clock Maria Theresa, although only five miles to windward,\nappeared like a lengthened shadow, scarcely visible. An hour later,\nquite a bright light, like a fire, blazed in the darkness. It was\nmotionless and stationary. \"That would seem to indicate a volcano,\" said Paganel, watching it\nattentively. \"However,\" replied Captain Mangles, \"at this distance we ought to hear\nthe commotion that always accompanies an eruption, and yet the wind\nbrings no sound to our ears.\" \"Indeed,\" observed Paganel, \"this volcano glows, but does not\nspeak.

However, before thinking of fatigue, or the imperative calls of hunger\nand thirst, Glenarvan questioned Tom Austin concerning his presence in\nthese waters. Why was the Duncan on the eastern coast of New Zealand? Why was she not in the hands of Ben Joyce? By what providential working\nhad God restored her to the fugitives? These were the questions that\nwere hurriedly addressed to Tom Austin. The old sailor did not know\nwhich to answer first. He therefore concluded to listen only to Lord\nGlenarvan, and reply to him. \"But the convicts?\" inquired Glenarvan. \"What have you done with the\nconvicts?\" \"The convicts!\" replied Tom Austin, like a man who is at a loss to\nunderstand a question. \"Yes; the wretches who attacked the yacht.\" \"What yacht, my lord?

A quick\nblush colored his hard features,--not the sign of remorse, but the\nshame of defeat. He was prisoner on this yacht that he had meant to\ncommand as master, and his fate was soon to be decided. However, he made no reply. Glenarvan waited patiently, but Ayrton still\npersisted in maintaining an obstinate silence. \"Speak, Ayrton; what have you to say?\" continued Glenarvan. The convict hesitated, and the lines of his forehead were strongly\ncontracted. At last he said, in a calm voice:\n\n\"I have nothing to say, my lord. I was foolish enough to let myself be\ntaken. Do what you please.\" [Sidenote: A DUMB PRISONER.] Having given his answer, the quartermaster turned his eyes toward\nthe coast that extended along the west, and affected a profound\nindifference for all that was passing around him. You would have\nthought, to look at him, that he was a stranger to this serious affair. But Glenarvan had resolved to be patient. A powerful motive urged\nhim to ascertain certain circumstances of Ayrton's mysterious life,\nespecially as regarded Harry Grant and the Britannia. He therefore\nresumed his inquiries, speaking with extreme mildness, and imposing the\nmost perfect calmness upon the violent agitation of his heart. \"I hope, Ayrton,\" continued he, \"that you will not refuse to answer\ncertain questions that I desire to ask you. And, first, am I to call\nyou Ayrton or Ben Joyce? Are you the quartermaster of the Britannia?\" Ayrton remained unmoved, watching the coast, deaf to every question. Glenarvan, whose eye flashed with some inward emotion, continued to\nquestion him. \"Will you tell me how you left the Britannia, and why you were in\nAustralia?\" There was the same silence, the same obstinacy. \"Listen to me, Ayrton,\" resumed Glenarvan. \"It is for your interest to\nspeak. We may reward a frank confession, which is your only resort. For\nthe last time, will you answer my questions?\" Ayrton turned his head towards Glenarvan, and looked him full in the\nface. \"My lord,\" said he, \"I have nothing to answer.

He crossed the deck\nwith a confident step, and ascended the poop-stairs.] Ayrton had grown animated while speaking, but soon relapsed into his\nformer indifference. He doubtless imagined that this declaration would\nend the examination: but Glenarvan resumed, and said:\n\n\"Ayrton, I am not a judge charged with trying you. This is not my\nbusiness.

Of what use can\nhe be?\" \"To give us the information we need for our journey,\" replied\nGlenarvan. \"Let us go in.\" Glenarvan, followed by Ayrton, entered the tavern. The landlord of\n\"Bush Inn\" was a coarse man, of forbidding appearance, who had to\nconsider himself as the principal customer for the gin, brandy, and\nwhisky of his tavern, and scarcely ever saw any one but squatters or\nherdsmen. He replied in an ill-humored way to the questions that were addressed\nhim; but his answers sufficed to determine Ayrton upon his course. Glenarvan, however, remunerated the tavern-keeper for the little\ntrouble they had given him, and was about to leave the inn, when a\nplacard, affixed to the wall, attracted his attention. It was a notice\nof the colonial police, detailing the escape of the convicts from\nPerth, and setting a price upon the head of Ben Joyce--a hundred pounds\nsterling to any one who should deliver him up. \"Indeed,\" said Glenarvan, \"that is a rascal worth hanging.\" \"And especially worth taking,\" replied Ayrton. \"A hundred pounds! What\na sum! He is not worth it.\" \"As for the inn-keeper,\" added Glenarvan, as he left the room, \"I\nscarcely put faith in him, despite his placard.\" \"Nor I either,\" said Ayrton. Glenarvan and the quartermaster rejoined the party, and they all\nproceeded to where a narrow pass wound across the chain. Here they\nbegan the ascent. [Sidenote: ANOTHER DEATH.] But it was an arduous task. More than once the ladies and their\ncompanions had to dismount, and it was often necessary to push the\nwheels of the heavy vehicle at some steep ascent, or to hold it\nback along the edge of some dangerous precipice. The oxen, as they\ncould not work to advantage at sudden turns, had frequently to be\nunyoked, and the cart blocked to prevent it from sliding back. Ayrton\nwas repeatedly forced to bring the already exhausted horses to his\nassistance. Whether this exertion was too prolonged, or whether from some other\ncause, one of the horses gave out during the ascent. He fell suddenly,\nwithout an instant's warning. It was Mulready's horse; and when the\nsailor attempted to help him up, he found that he was dead. Ayrton\nexamined the animal carefully, but did not seem to understand the cause\nof this sudden death. \"The beast must have burst a blood-vessel,\" said Glenarvan. \"Evidently,\" replied Ayrton. \"Take my horse, Mulready,\" added Glenarvan; \"I will join Lady Helena in\nthe cart.\" Mulready obeyed, and the little party continued their fatiguing ascent,\nabandoning the body to the crows. The next day they began the descent, which was much more rapid. During\nits course a violent hail-storm burst on them, and they were forced to\nseek a shelter beneath the rocks. Not hailstones, but pieces of ice as\nlarge as one's hand, were precipitated from the angry clouds. A sling\ncould not have hurled them with greater force, and several sharp blows\nwarned Paganel and Robert to be on their guard.

Then, controlling\nher emotion, this courageous woman had assisted Glenarvan to the cart. Here the shoulder of the wounded man was laid bare, and the major\nperceived that the ball had lacerated the flesh, causing no other\ninjury. Neither bones nor large muscles seemed affected. The wound bled\nconsiderably, but Glenarvan, by moving the fingers of his hand and\nfore-arm, encouraged his friends to expect a favorable result. When his\nwound was dressed, he no longer desired any attention, and explanations\nfollowed. The travelers, except Wilson and Mulready, who were keeping\nguard outside, had taken seats as well as possible in the cart, and the\nmajor was requested to speak. Before beginning his story, he informed Lady Helena of the escape of\na band of convicts from Perth, their appearance in the province of\nVictoria, and their complicity in the railway disaster. He gave her\nthe number of the _Australian and New Zealand Gazette_ purchased at\nSeymour, and added that the police had set a price on the head of Ben\nJoyce, a formidable bandit, whom eighteen months of crime had given a\nwide-spread notoriety. But how had MacNabb recognized this Ben Joyce in the quartermaster\nAyrton? Here was the mystery that all wished to solve; and the major\nexplained. Since the day of his meeting with Ayrton he had suspected him. Two or\nthree almost insignificant circumstances, a glance exchanged between\nthe quartermaster and the farrier at Wimerra River, Ayrton's hesitation\nto pass through the towns and villages, his strong wish to order the\nDuncan to the coast, the strange death of the animals confided to his\ncare, and, finally, a want of frankness in his actions,--all these\nfacts, gradually noticed, had roused the major's suspicions. However, he could form no direct accusation until the events that had\ntranspired the preceding night. Gliding between the tall clumps of\nshrubbery, as was related in the previous chapter, he approached near\nthe suspicious shadows that had attracted his attention half a mile\nfrom the encampment. The phosphorescent plants cast their pale rays\nthrough the darkness. Three men were examining some tracks on the\nground, and among them he recognized the farrier of Black Point Station. \"Here they are,\" said one. \"Yes,\" replied another, \"here is the trefoil of the hoofs again.\" \"It has been like this since leaving the Wimerra.\" \"All the horses are dead.\" \"The poison is not far away.\" \"There is enough here to settle an entire troop of cavalry. This\ngastrolobium is a useful plant.\" \"Then they were silent,\" added MacNabb, \"and departed. I wanted to know\nmore: I followed them. The conversation soon began again. 'A cunning\nman, this Ben Joyce,' said the farrier; 'a famous quartermaster, with\nhis invented shipwreck. If his plan succeeds, it will be a stroke of\nfortune. Devilish Ayrton! Call him Ben Joyce, for he has well earned\nhis name.' These rascals then left the wood of gum-trees.

I promise you it affords _me_ as little pleasure to revive\nit as it does you. All I ask is, that Villefort will be firm and\ninflexible for the future in his political principles. Remember, also,\nVillefort, that we have pledged ourselves to his majesty for your\nfealty and strict loyalty, and that at our recommendation the king\nconsented to forget the past, as I do” (and here she extended to him\nher hand)—“as I now do at your entreaty. But bear in mind, that should\nthere fall in your way anyone guilty of conspiring against the\ngovernment, you will be so much the more bound to visit the offence\nwith rigorous punishment, as it is known you belong to a suspected\nfamily.”\n\n“Alas, madame,” returned Villefort, “my profession, as well as the\ntimes in which we live, compels me to be severe. I have already\nsuccessfully conducted several public prosecutions, and brought the\noffenders to merited punishment. But we have not done with the thing\nyet.”\n\n0087m\n\n\n\n“Do you, indeed, think so?” inquired the marquise. “I am, at least, fearful of it. Napoleon, in the Island of Elba, is too\nnear France, and his proximity keeps up the hopes of his partisans. Marseilles is filled with half-pay officers, who are daily, under one\nfrivolous pretext or other, getting up quarrels with the royalists;\nfrom hence arise continual and fatal duels among the higher classes of\npersons, and assassinations in the lower.”\n\n“You have heard, perhaps,” said the Comte de Salvieux, one of M. de\nSaint-Méran’s oldest friends, and chamberlain to the Comte d’Artois,\n“that the Holy Alliance purpose removing him from thence?”\n\n“Yes; they were talking about it when we left Paris,” said M. de\nSaint-Méran; “and where is it decided to transfer him?”\n\n“To Saint Helena.”\n\n“For heaven’s sake, where is that?” asked the marquise. “An island situated on the other side of the equator, at least two\nthousand leagues from here,” replied the count. “So much the better. As Villefort observes, it is a great act of folly\nto have left such a man between Corsica, where he was born, and Naples,\nof which his brother-in-law is king, and face to face with Italy, the\nsovereignty of which he coveted for his son.”\n\n“Unfortunately,” said Villefort, “there are the treaties of 1814, and\nwe cannot molest Napoleon without breaking those compacts.”\n\n“Oh, well, we shall find some way out of it,” responded M. de Salvieux. “There wasn’t any trouble over treaties when it was a question of\nshooting the poor Duc d’Enghien.”\n\n“Well,” said the marquise, “it seems probable that, by the aid of the\nHoly Alliance, we shall be rid of Napoleon; and we must trust to the\nvigilance of M. de Villefort to purify Marseilles of his partisans.", "similarity": 0.5946348905563354}, {"chunk_id": 74, "text": "You think he is tracked, pursued, captured; he is advancing\nas rapidly as his own eagles.

Everyone knows the history of the famous return from\nElba, a return which was unprecedented in the past, and will probably\nremain without a counterpart in the future. Louis XVIII. made but a faint attempt to parry this unexpected blow;\nthe monarchy he had scarcely reconstructed tottered on its precarious\nfoundation, and at a sign from the emperor the incongruous structure of\nancient prejudices and new ideas fell to the ground.

Villefort quietly opened a window, saying, “It is\nvery warm, and the heat affects M. Noirtier.” He then returned to his\nplace, but did not sit down. “This marriage,” added Madame de Villefort, “is quite agreeable to the\nwishes of M. d’Épinay and his family; besides, he had no relations\nnearer than an uncle and aunt, his mother having died at his birth, and\nhis father having been assassinated in 1815, that is to say, when he\nwas but two years old; it naturally followed that the child was\npermitted to choose his own pursuits, and he has, therefore, seldom\nacknowledged any other authority but that of his own will.”\n\n“That assassination was a mysterious affair,” said Villefort, “and the\nperpetrators have hitherto escaped detection, although suspicion has\nfallen on the head of more than one person.”\n\nNoirtier made such an effort that his lips expanded into a smile. “Now,” continued Villefort, “those to whom the guilt really belongs, by\nwhom the crime was committed, on whose heads the justice of man may\nprobably descend here, and the certain judgment of God hereafter, would\nrejoice in the opportunity thus afforded of bestowing such a\npeace-offering as Valentine on the son of him whose life they so\nruthlessly destroyed.” Noirtier had succeeded in mastering his emotion\nmore than could have been deemed possible with such an enfeebled and\nshattered frame. “Yes, I understand,” was the reply contained in his look; and this look\nexpressed a feeling of strong indignation, mixed with profound\ncontempt.

In the meanwhile, as the thing is difficult to find in\nFrance, and your abbé is not probably disposed to make a journey to\nParis on my account, I must continue to use Monsieur Planche’s\nanti-spasmodics; and mint and Hoffman’s drops are among my favorite\nremedies. Here are some lozenges which I have made up on purpose; they\nare compounded doubly strong.”\n\nMonte Cristo opened the tortoise-shell box, which the lady presented to\nhim, and inhaled the odor of the lozenges with the air of an amateur\nwho thoroughly appreciated their composition. “They are indeed exquisite,” he said; “but as they are necessarily\nsubmitted to the process of deglutition—a function which it is\nfrequently impossible for a fainting person to accomplish—I prefer my\nown specific.”\n\n“Undoubtedly, and so should I prefer it, after the effects I have seen\nproduced; but of course it is a secret, and I am not so indiscreet as\nto ask it of you.”\n\n“But I,” said Monte Cristo, rising as he spoke—“I am gallant enough to\noffer it you.”\n\n30079m\n\n\n\n“How kind you are.”\n\n“Only remember one thing—a small dose is a remedy, a large one is\npoison. One drop will restore life, as you have seen; five or six will\ninevitably kill, and in a way the more terrible inasmuch as, poured\ninto a glass of wine, it would not in the slightest degree affect its\nflavor. But I say no more, madame; it is really as if I were\nprescribing for you.”\n\nThe clock struck half-past six, and a lady was announced, a friend of\nMadame de Villefort, who came to dine with her.", "similarity": 0.3031007647514343}, {"chunk_id": 104, "text": "“Night!—why, for Heaven’s sake, are your eyes like cats’, that you can\nsee to work in the dark?”\n\n“Indeed they are not; but God has supplied man with the intelligence\nthat enables him to overcome the limitations of natural conditions. I\nfurnished myself with a light.”\n\n“You did? Pray tell me how.”\n\n“I separated the fat from the meat served to me, melted it, and so made\noil—here is my lamp.” So saying, the abbé exhibited a sort of torch\nvery similar to those used in public illuminations. “But how do you procure a light?”\n\n“Oh, here are two flints and a piece of burnt linen.”\n\n“And matches?”\n\n“I pretended that I had a disorder of the skin, and asked for a little\nsulphur, which was readily supplied.”\n\nDantès laid the different things he had been looking at on the table,\nand stood with his head drooping on his breast, as though overwhelmed\nby the perseverance and strength of Faria’s mind. 0215m\n\n\n\n“You have not seen all yet,” continued Faria, “for I did not think it\nwise to trust all my treasures in the same hiding-place. Let us shut\nthis one up.” They put the stone back in its place; the abbé sprinkled\na little dust over it to conceal the traces of its having been removed,\nrubbed his foot well on it to make it assume the same appearance as the\nother, and then, going towards his bed, he removed it from the spot it\nstood in. Behind the head of the bed, and concealed by a stone fitting\nin so closely as to defy all suspicion, was a hollow space, and in this\nspace a ladder of cords between twenty-five and thirty feet in length. Dantès closely and eagerly examined it; he found it firm, solid, and\ncompact enough to bear any weight. “Who supplied you with the materials for making this wonderful work?”\n\n“I tore up several of my shirts, and ripped out the seams in the sheets\nof my bed, during my three years’ imprisonment at Fenestrelle; and when\nI was removed to the Château d’If, I managed to bring the ravellings\nwith me, so that I have been able to finish my work here.”\n\n“And was it not discovered that your sheets were unhemmed?”\n\n“Oh, no, for when I had taken out the thread I required, I hemmed the\nedges over again.”\n\n“With what?”\n\n“With this needle,” said the abbé, as, opening his ragged vestments, he\nshowed Dantès a long, sharp fish-bone, with a small perforated eye for\nthe thread, a small portion of which still remained in it. “I once thought,” continued Faria, “of removing these iron bars, and\nletting myself down from the window, which, as you see, is somewhat\nwider than yours, although I should have enlarged it still more\npreparatory to my flight; however, I discovered that I should merely\nhave dropped into a sort of inner court, and I therefore renounced the\nproject altogether as too full of risk and danger. Nevertheless, I\ncarefully preserved my ladder against one of those unforeseen\nopportunities of which I spoke just now, and which sudden chance\nfrequently brings about.”\n\nWhile affecting to be deeply engaged in examining the ladder, the mind\nof Dantès was, in fact, busily occupied by the idea that a person so\nintelligent, ingenious, and clear-sighted as the abbé might probably be\nable to solve the dark mystery of his own misfortunes, where he himself\ncould see nothing. “What are you thinking of?” asked the abbé smilingly, imputing the deep\nabstraction in which his visitor was plunged to the excess of his awe\nand wonder.", "similarity": 0.39742180705070496}]}

Chapter 19. The Third Attack\n\nNow that this treasure, which had so long been the object of the abbé’s\nmeditations, could insure the future happiness of him whom Faria really\nloved as a son, it had doubled its value in his eyes, and every day he\nexpatiated on the amount, explaining to Dantès all the good which, with\nthirteen or fourteen millions of francs, a man could do in these days\nto his friends; and then Dantès’ countenance became gloomy, for the\noath of vengeance he had taken recurred to his memory, and he reflected\nhow much ill, in these times, a man with thirteen or fourteen millions\ncould do to his enemies. The abbé did not know the Island of Monte Cristo; but Dantès knew it,\nand had often passed it, situated twenty-five miles from Pianosa,\nbetween Corsica and the Island of Elba, and had once touched there. This island was, always had been, and still is, completely deserted. It\nis a rock of almost conical form, which looks as though it had been\nthrust up by volcanic force from the depth to the surface of the ocean. Dantès drew a plan of the island for Faria, and Faria gave Dantès\nadvice as to the means he should employ to recover the treasure. But\nDantès was far from being as enthusiastic and confident as the old man. It was past a question now that Faria was not a lunatic, and the way in\nwhich he had achieved the discovery, which had given rise to the\nsuspicion of his madness, increased Edmond’s admiration of him; but at\nthe same time Dantès could not believe that the deposit, supposing it\nhad ever existed, still existed; and though he considered the treasure\nas by no means chimerical, he yet believed it was no longer there. However, as if fate resolved on depriving the prisoners of their last\nchance, and making them understand that they were condemned to\nperpetual imprisonment, a new misfortune befell them; the gallery on\nthe sea side, which had long been in ruins, was rebuilt. They had\nrepaired it completely, and stopped up with vast masses of stone the\nhole Dantès had partly filled in. But for this precaution, which, it\nwill be remembered, the abbé had made to Edmond, the misfortune would\nhave been still greater, for their attempt to escape would have been\ndetected, and they would undoubtedly have been separated. Thus a new, a\nstronger, and more inexorable barrier was interposed to cut off the\nrealization of their hopes. “You see,” said the young man, with an air of sorrowful resignation, to\nFaria, “that God deems it right to take from me any claim to merit for\nwhat you call my devotion to you. I have promised to remain forever\nwith you, and now I could not break my promise if I would. The treasure\nwill be no more mine than yours, and neither of us will quit this\nprison. But my real treasure is not that, my dear friend, which awaits\nme beneath the sombre rocks of Monte Cristo, it is your presence, our\nliving together five or six hours a day, in spite of our jailers; it is\nthe rays of intelligence you have elicited from my brain, the languages\nyou have implanted in my memory, and which have taken root there with\nall their philological ramifications.", "similarity": 0.43863552808761597}, {"chunk_id": 128, "text": "Faria, as we have said, without having recovered the use of his hand\nand foot, had regained all the clearness of his understanding, and had\ngradually, besides the moral instructions we have detailed, taught his\nyouthful companion the patient and sublime duty of a prisoner, who\nlearns to make something from nothing. They were thus perpetually\nemployed,—Faria, that he might not see himself grow old; Dantès, for\nfear of recalling the almost extinct past which now only floated in his\nmemory like a distant light wandering in the night. So life went on for\nthem as it does for those who are not victims of misfortune and whose\nactivities glide along mechanically and tranquilly beneath the eye of\nProvidence. But beneath this superficial calm there were in the heart of the young\nman, and perhaps in that of the old man, many repressed desires, many\nstifled sighs, which found vent when Faria was left alone, and when\nEdmond returned to his cell. One night Edmond awoke suddenly, believing that he heard someone\ncalling him. He opened his eyes upon utter darkness. His name, or\nrather a plaintive voice which essayed to pronounce his name, reached\nhim. He sat up in bed and a cold sweat broke out upon his brow. Undoubtedly the call came from Faria’s dungeon. “Alas,” murmured Edmond; “can it be?”\n\nHe moved his bed, drew up the stone, rushed into the passage, and\nreached the opposite extremity; the secret entrance was open. By the\nlight of the wretched and wavering lamp, of which we have spoken,\nDantès saw the old man, pale, but yet erect, clinging to the bedstead. His features were writhing with those horrible symptoms which he\nalready knew, and which had so seriously alarmed him when he saw them\nfor the first time. “Alas, my dear friend,” said Faria in a resigned tone, “you understand,\ndo you not, and I need not attempt to explain to you?”\n\nEdmond uttered a cry of agony, and, quite out of his senses, rushed\ntowards the door, exclaiming, “Help, help!”\n\nFaria had just sufficient strength to restrain him. “Silence,” he said, “or you are lost. We must now only think of you, my\ndear friend, and so act as to render your captivity supportable or your\nflight possible. It would require years to do again what I have done\nhere, and the results would be instantly destroyed if our jailers knew\nwe had communicated with each other. Besides, be assured, my dear\nEdmond, the dungeon I am about to leave will not long remain empty;\nsome other unfortunate being will soon take my place, and to him you\nwill appear like an angel of salvation. Perhaps he will be young,\nstrong, and enduring, like yourself, and will aid you in your escape,\nwhile I have been but a hindrance. You will no longer have half a dead\nbody tied to you as a drag to all your movements. At length Providence\nhas done something for you; he restores to you more than he takes away,\nand it was time I should die.”\n\nEdmond could only clasp his hands and exclaim, “Oh, my friend, my\nfriend, speak not thus!” and then resuming all his presence of mind,\nwhich had for a moment staggered under this blow, and his strength,\nwhich had failed at the words of the old man, he said, “Oh, I have\nsaved you once, and I will save you a second time!” And raising the\nfoot of the bed, he drew out the phial, still a third filled with the\nred liquor. “See,” he exclaimed, “there remains still some of the magic draught.

It was the governor, who, hearing of Faria’s illness from the jailer,\nhad come in person to see him. Faria sat up to receive him, avoiding all gestures in order that he\nmight conceal from the governor the paralysis that had already half\nstricken him with death. His fear was lest the governor, touched with\npity, might order him to be removed to better quarters, and thus\nseparate him from his young companion. But fortunately this was not the\ncase, and the governor left him, convinced that the poor madman, for\nwhom in his heart he felt a kind of affection, was only troubled with a\nslight indisposition. During this time, Edmond, seated on his bed with his head in his hands,\ntried to collect his scattered thoughts. Faria, since their first\nacquaintance, had been on all points so rational and logical, so\nwonderfully sagacious, in fact, that he could not understand how so\nmuch wisdom on all points could be allied with madness. Was Faria\ndeceived as to his treasure, or was all the world deceived as to Faria? Dantès remained in his cell all day, not daring to return to his\nfriend, thinking thus to defer the moment when he should be convinced,\nonce for all, that the abbé was mad—such a conviction would be so\nterrible! But, towards the evening after the hour for the customary visit had\ngone by, Faria, not seeing the young man appear, tried to move and get\nover the distance which separated them. Edmond shuddered when he heard\nthe painful efforts which the old man made to drag himself along; his\nleg was inert, and he could no longer make use of one arm. Edmond was\nobliged to assist him, for otherwise he would not have been able to\nenter by the small aperture which led to Dantès’ chamber. “Here I am, pursuing you remorselessly,” he said with a benignant\nsmile. “You thought to escape my munificence, but it is in vain. Listen\nto me.”\n\nEdmond saw there was no escape, and placing the old man on his bed, he\nseated himself on the stool beside him.", "similarity": 0.437463641166687}, {"chunk_id": 153, "text": "A day or two of rest will set me up,\nand I hope I shall find among the rocks certain herbs most excellent\nfor bruises.”\n\nA peculiar smile passed over Dantès’ lips; he squeezed Jacopo’s hand\nwarmly, but nothing could shake his determination to remain—and remain\nalone. The smugglers left with Edmond what he had requested and set sail, but\nnot without turning about several times, and each time making signs of\na cordial farewell, to which Edmond replied with his hand only, as if\nhe could not move the rest of his body. Then, when they had disappeared, he said with a smile,—“’Tis strange\nthat it should be among such men that we find proofs of friendship and\ndevotion.” Then he dragged himself cautiously to the top of a rock,\nfrom which he had a full view of the sea, and thence he saw the tartan\ncomplete her preparations for sailing, weigh anchor, and, balancing\nherself as gracefully as a water-fowl ere it takes to the wing, set\nsail. At the end of an hour she was completely out of sight; at least, it was\nimpossible for the wounded man to see her any longer from the spot\nwhere he was. Then Dantès rose more agile and light than the kid among\nthe myrtles and shrubs of these wild rocks, took his gun in one hand,\nhis pickaxe in the other, and hastened towards the rock on which the\nmarks he had noted terminated. “And now,” he exclaimed, remembering the tale of the Arabian fisherman,\nwhich Faria had related to him, “now, Open Sesame!”\n\n\n\n Chapter 24. The Secret Cave\n\nThe sun had nearly reached the meridian, and his scorching rays fell\nfull on the rocks, which seemed themselves sensible of the heat. Thousands of grasshoppers, hidden in the bushes, chirped with a\nmonotonous and dull note; the leaves of the myrtle and olive trees\nwaved and rustled in the wind. At every step that Edmond took he\ndisturbed the lizards glittering with the hues of the emerald; afar off\nhe saw the wild goats bounding from crag to crag. In a word, the island\nwas inhabited, yet Edmond felt himself alone, guided by the hand of\nGod. He felt an indescribable sensation somewhat akin to dread—that dread of\nthe daylight which even in the desert makes us fear we are watched and\nobserved. This feeling was so strong that at the moment when Edmond was\nabout to begin his labor, he stopped, laid down his pickaxe, seized his\ngun, mounted to the summit of the highest rock, and from thence gazed\nround in every direction. But it was not upon Corsica, the very houses of which he could\ndistinguish; or on Sardinia; or on the Island of Elba, with its\nhistorical associations; or upon the almost imperceptible line that to\nthe experienced eye of a sailor alone revealed the coast of Genoa the\nproud, and Leghorn the commercial, that he gazed. It was at the\nbrigantine that had left in the morning, and the tartan that had just\nset sail, that Edmond fixed his eyes. The first was just disappearing in the straits of Bonifacio; the other,\nfollowing an opposite direction, was about to round the Island of\nCorsica. This sight reassured him. He then looked at the objects near him. He\nsaw that he was on the highest point of the island,—a statue on this\nvast pedestal of granite, nothing human appearing in sight, while the\nblue ocean beat against the base of the island, and covered it with a\nfringe of foam. Then he descended with cautious and slow step, for he\ndreaded lest an accident similar to that he had so adroitly feigned\nshould happen in reality.", "similarity": 0.40000998973846436}, {"chunk_id": 507, "text": "At the end of two hundred years the documents\nwere found, and they thought of bringing up the jars.

When he had finished with the orange-tree, he began at\nthe cactus; but this, not being so easily plucked as the orange-tree,\npricked him dreadfully. He shuddered, and rubbed his eyes as though\nawaking from a dream. “Sir,” said Monte Cristo to him, “I do not recommend my pictures to\nyou, who possess such splendid paintings; but, nevertheless, here are\ntwo by Hobbema, a Paul Potter, a Mieris, two by Gerard Douw, a Raphael,\na Van Dyck, a Zurbaran, and two or three by Murillo, worth looking at.”\n\n“Stay,” said Debray; “I recognize this Hobbema.”\n\n“Ah, indeed!”\n\n“Yes; it was proposed for the Museum.”\n\n“Which, I believe, does not contain one?” said Monte Cristo. “No; and yet they refused to buy it.”\n\n“Why?” said Château-Renaud. “You pretend not to know,—because government was not rich enough.”\n\n“Ah, pardon me,” said Château-Renaud; “I have heard of these things\nevery day during the last eight years, and I cannot understand them\nyet.”\n\n“You will, by and by,” said Debray. “I think not,” replied Château-Renaud. “Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti and Count Andrea Cavalcanti,” announced\nBaptistin.

Close to him, dressed in entirely new\nclothes, advanced smilingly Count Andrea Cavalcanti, the dutiful son,\nwhom we also know. The three young people were talking together. On the\nentrance of the new-comers, their eyes glanced from father to son, and\nthen, naturally enough, rested on the latter, whom they began\ncriticising. “Cavalcanti!” said Debray. “A fine name,” said Morrel. “Yes,” said Château-Renaud, “these Italians are well named and badly\ndressed.”\n\n“You are fastidious, Château-Renaud,” replied Debray; “those clothes\nare well cut and quite new.”\n\n“That is just what I find fault with.

STRANGE SIGNS. After their first outbursts of joy at meeting were over, Paganel,\nAustin, Wilson, and Mulready--all who had remained behind, except the\nmajor--were conscious of one thing, namely, that they were suffering\nfrom thirst. Fortunately, the Guamini flowed at no great distance. They accordingly continued their journey, and at seven o'clock in the\nmorning the little party arrived at the ramada. On seeing its entrance\nstrewn with the bodies of the wolves, it was easy to understand the\nviolence of the attack and the vigor of the defense. The travelers,\nafter fully quenching their thirst, devoted their attention to\nbreakfast in the inclosure. The ostrich-steaks were declared excellent,\nand the armadillo, roasted in its own covering, was a delicious dish. \"To eat reasonably of this,\" said Paganel, \"would be ingratitude\ntowards Providence.

Of what use can\nhe be?\" \"To give us the information we need for our journey,\" replied\nGlenarvan. \"Let us go in.\" Glenarvan, followed by Ayrton, entered the tavern. The landlord of\n\"Bush Inn\" was a coarse man, of forbidding appearance, who had to\nconsider himself as the principal customer for the gin, brandy, and\nwhisky of his tavern, and scarcely ever saw any one but squatters or\nherdsmen. He replied in an ill-humored way to the questions that were addressed\nhim; but his answers sufficed to determine Ayrton upon his course. Glenarvan, however, remunerated the tavern-keeper for the little\ntrouble they had given him, and was about to leave the inn, when a\nplacard, affixed to the wall, attracted his attention. It was a notice\nof the colonial police, detailing the escape of the convicts from\nPerth, and setting a price upon the head of Ben Joyce--a hundred pounds\nsterling to any one who should deliver him up. \"Indeed,\" said Glenarvan, \"that is a rascal worth hanging.\" \"And especially worth taking,\" replied Ayrton. \"A hundred pounds! What\na sum! He is not worth it.\" \"As for the inn-keeper,\" added Glenarvan, as he left the room, \"I\nscarcely put faith in him, despite his placard.\" \"Nor I either,\" said Ayrton. Glenarvan and the quartermaster rejoined the party, and they all\nproceeded to where a narrow pass wound across the chain. Here they\nbegan the ascent. [Sidenote: ANOTHER DEATH.] But it was an arduous task. More than once the ladies and their\ncompanions had to dismount, and it was often necessary to push the\nwheels of the heavy vehicle at some steep ascent, or to hold it\nback along the edge of some dangerous precipice. The oxen, as they\ncould not work to advantage at sudden turns, had frequently to be\nunyoked, and the cart blocked to prevent it from sliding back. Ayrton\nwas repeatedly forced to bring the already exhausted horses to his\nassistance. Whether this exertion was too prolonged, or whether from some other\ncause, one of the horses gave out during the ascent. He fell suddenly,\nwithout an instant's warning. It was Mulready's horse; and when the\nsailor attempted to help him up, he found that he was dead. Ayrton\nexamined the animal carefully, but did not seem to understand the cause\nof this sudden death. \"The beast must have burst a blood-vessel,\" said Glenarvan. \"Evidently,\" replied Ayrton. \"Take my horse, Mulready,\" added Glenarvan; \"I will join Lady Helena in\nthe cart.\" Mulready obeyed, and the little party continued their fatiguing ascent,\nabandoning the body to the crows. The next day they began the descent, which was much more rapid. During\nits course a violent hail-storm burst on them, and they were forced to\nseek a shelter beneath the rocks. Not hailstones, but pieces of ice as\nlarge as one's hand, were precipitated from the angry clouds. A sling\ncould not have hurled them with greater force, and several sharp blows\nwarned Paganel and Robert to be on their guard.

As soon as he arrived at the bay, he was to\nsend a detachment of sailors under the command of Ayrton. He had just reached this part of his letter, when the major, who had\nbeen looking over his shoulder, asked him, in a singular tone, how he\nwrote the word Ayrton. \"As it is pronounced,\" replied Glenarvan. \"That is a mistake,\" said the major coolly. \"It is pronounced Ayrton,\nbut it is written 'Ben Joyce'!\" CHAPTER XLI. THE PLOT UNVEILED. The sound of the name of Ben Joyce fell upon the party like a\nthunderbolt. Ayrton suddenly sprang to his feet. In his hand was a\nrevolver. A report was heard; and Glenarvan fell, struck by a bullet. Before Captain Mangles and the sailors recovered from the surprise into\nwhich this unexpected turn of affairs had thrown them, the audacious\nconvict had escaped, and joined his band, scattered along the edge of\nthe wood of gum-trees. [Illustration: A report was heard; and Glenarvan fell, struck by a\nbullet.] The tent did not offer a sufficient shelter against the bullets, and\nit was clearly necessary to beat a retreat.

The captain, the major, Paganel, and the sailors then seized their\nrifles, and stood ready to repel the convicts. Glenarvan and Robert had\njoined the ladies, while Olbinett hastened to the common defence. These events had transpired with the rapidity of lightning. Captain\nMangles attentively watched the edge of the wood; but the reports\nsuddenly ceased on the arrival of Ben Joyce, and a profound silence\nsucceeded the noisy fusillade. A few wreaths of white smoke were still\ncurling up between the branches of the gum-trees, but the tall tufts of\ngastrolobium were motionless and all signs of attack had disappeared. The major and Captain Mangles extended their examinations as far as the\ngreat trees. The place was abandoned. Numerous footprints were seen,\nand a few half-burnt cartridges smoked on the ground. The major, like\na prudent man, extinguished them, for a spark was enough to kindle a\nformidable conflagration in this forest of dry trees. \"The convicts have disappeared,\" said Captain Mangles. \"Yes,\" replied the major; \"and this disappearance alarms me. I should\nprefer to meet them face to face. It is better to encounter a tiger in\nthe open plain than a serpent in the grass. Let us search these bushes\naround the cart.\" [Sidenote: UNRAVELINGS.] The major and captain scoured the surrounding country. But from the\nedge of the wood to the banks of the Snowy they did not meet with a\nsingle convict. Ben Joyce's band seemed to have flown away, like a\nflock of mischievous birds. This disappearance was too strange to\ninspire a perfect security. They therefore resolved to keep on the\nwatch.

The taboo, which is common to the tribes of Polynesia, has the power\nto prohibit at once all connection with the object or person tabooed. According to the Maori religion, whoever should lay his sacrilegious\nhand on what is declared taboo would be punished with death by the\noffended god; and in case the divinity should delay to avenge his own\ninsult, the priests would not fail to excite his anger. As for the prisoners confined in the temple, the taboo had rescued\nthem from the fury of the tribe. Some of the natives, the friends and\npartisans of Kai-Koumou, had stopped suddenly at the command of their\nchief, and had protected the captives. [Sidenote: THE TORTURES OF SUSPENSE.] Glenarvan, however, was not blind to the fate that was reserved for\nhim. Only his death could atone for the murder of a chief. Among savage\nraces death is always preceded by a protracted torture. He therefore\nexpected to cruelly expiate the righteous indignation that had nerved\nhis arm, but hoped that Kai-Koumou's rage would fall only on himself. What a night he and his companions passed! Who could depict their\nanguish, or measure their sufferings? Neither poor Robert nor brave\nPaganel had reappeared. But how could they doubt their fate? Were they\nnot the first victims of the natives' vengeance? All hope had vanished\neven from the heart of the major, who did not easily despair. John\nMangles felt himself growing mad at sight of the sad dejection of Mary\nGrant, thus separated from her brother. Glenarvan thought of that\nterrible request of Lady Helena, who, rather than yield to torture or\nslavery, preferred to die by his hand. Could he summon this fearful\ncourage? As for an escape, that was plainly impossible. Ten warriors,\narmed to the teeth, guarded the entrance of the temple. Morning came at last. There had been no communication between the\nnatives and the prisoners. The hut contained a considerable quantity\nof food, which the unfortunates scarcely touched. Hunger gave place to\ngrief. The day passed without bringing a change or a hope. Doubtless\nthe hour for the dead chief's funeral and their torture would be the\nsame. However, although Glenarvan concluded that Kai-Koumou must have\nabandoned all idea of exchange, the major on this point retained a\ngleam of hope. \"Who knows,\" said he, reminding Glenarvan of the effect produced upon\nthe chief by the death of Kara-Tété,--\"who knows but that Kai-Koumou in\nreality feels obliged to you?\" But, in spite of these observations, Glenarvan would no longer hope. The next day also passed away without the preparations for torture\nbeing made. The reason of the delay was this. The Maoris believe that the soul, for three days after death, inhabits\nthe body of the deceased, and therefore during this time the corpse\nremains unburied. This custom was rigorously observed, and for two days\nthe pah was deserted. Captain Mangles frequently stood on Wilson's\nshoulders and surveyed the fortification. No native was seen; only the\nsentinels guarded in turn at the door of their prison. But on the third day the huts were opened.

Eight oars at\nthe bow propelled it up the river, while a man at the stern guided it\nby means of a movable paddle. This man was a native, of tall form, about forty-five years old, with\nbroad breast and powerful limbs. His protruding and deeply furrowed\nbrow, his fierce look and his sinister countenance, showed him to be a\nformidable individual. He was a Maori chief of high rank, as could be seen by the delicate\nand compact tattooing that striped his face and body. Two black\nspirals, starting from the nostrils of his aquiline nose, circled his\ntawny eyes, met on his forehead, and were lost in his abundant hair. His mouth, with its shining teeth, and his chin, were hidden beneath\na net-work of varied colors, while graceful lines wound down to his\nsinewy breast. There was no doubt as to his rank. The sharp albatross bone, used\nby Maori tattooers, had furrowed his face five times, in close and\ndeep lines. That he had reached his fifth promotion was evident from\nhis haughty bearing. A large flaxen mat, ornamented with dog-skins,\nenveloped his person; while a girdle, bloody with his recent conflicts,\nencircled his waist. From his ears dangled ear-rings of green jade, and\naround his neck hung necklaces of \"pounamous,\" sacred stones to which\nthe New Zealanders attribute miraculous properties. At his side lay a\ngun of English manufacture, and a \"patou-patou,\" a kind of double-edged\nhatchet. Near him nine warriors, of lower rank, armed and of ferocious aspect,\nsome still suffering from recent wounds, stood in perfect immobility,\nenveloped in their flaxen mantles. Three dogs of wild appearance were\nstretched at their feet. The eight rowers seemed to be servants or\nslaves of the chief. They worked vigorously, and the boat ascended the\ncurrent of the Waikato with remarkable swiftness. In the centre of this long canoe, with feet tied, but hands free, were\nten European prisoners clinging closely to each other. They were Lord\nGlenarvan and his companions. [Sidenote: A TESTING TIME.] The evening before, the little party, led astray by the dense fog, had\nencamped in the midst of a numerous tribe of natives. About midnight,\nthe travelers, surprised in their sleep, were made prisoners and\ncarried on board the canoe. They had not yet been maltreated, but had\ntried in vain to resist. Their arms and ammunition were in the hands of\nthe savages, and their own bullets would have quickly stretched them on\nthe earth had they attempted to escape. They were not long in learning, by the aid of a few English words which\nthe natives used, that, being driven back by the British troops, they\nwere returning, vanquished and weakened, to the regions of the upper\nWaikato. Their chief, after an obstinate resistance, in which he lost\nhis principal warriors, was now on his way to rouse again the river\ntribes. He was called Kai-Koumou, a terrible name, which signified\nin the native language \"he who eats the limbs of his enemy.\" He was\nbrave and bold, but his cruelty equaled his bravery. No pity could be\nexpected from him. His name was well known to the English soldiers, and\na price had been set upon his head by the governor of New Zealand. This terrible catastrophe had come upon Glenarvan just as he was\nabout reaching the long-desired harbor of Auckland, whence he would\nhave returned to his native country.", "similarity": 0.31312263011932373}, {"chunk_id": 96, "text": "In a few moments the gigantic water-spout struck the ombu and enveloped\nit in its watery folds. The tree was shaken to its very base, so that\nGlenarvan might have thought that the alligators had attacked it\nwith their powerful jaws and were uprooting it from the ground. His\ncompanions and he, clinging to one another, felt the mighty tree give\nway and fall, and saw its flaming branches plunge into the tumultuous\nwaters with a frightful hiss. It was the work of a second. The\nwater-spout had passed, to exert elsewhere its destructive violence,\nand pumping the waters of the plain as if it would exhaust them. The tree now, loosened from its moorings, floated onward under the\ncombined impulses of wind and current. The alligators had fled, except\none which crawled along the upturned roots and advanced with open jaws;\nbut Mulready, seizing a large brand, struck the creature so powerful\na blow that he broke its back. The vanquished animal sank in the\neddies of the torrent, still lashing his formidable tail with terrible\nviolence. Glenarvan and his companions, delivered from these voracious creatures,\ntook refuge on the branches to leeward of the fire, while the tree,\nwrapped by the blast of the hurricane in glowing sheets of flame,\nfloated on like a burning ship in the darkness of the night. CHAPTER XXVI. THE RETURN ON BOARD. For two hours the tree floated on the immense lake without reaching\n_terra firma_. The flames had gradually died out, and thus the\nprincipal danger of this terrible voyage had vanished. The current,\nstill keeping its original direction, flowed from southwest to\nnortheast; the darkness, though illumined now and then by flashes, had\nbecome profound, and Paganel sought in vain for his bearings. But the\nstorm was abating, the large drops of rain gave place to light spray\nthat was scattered by the wind, while the huge distended clouds were\ncrossed by light bands. The tree advanced rapidly on the impetuous torrent, gliding with\nsurprising swiftness, as if some powerful propelling means were\ninclosed within its trunk. There was as yet no certainty that they\nwould not float on thus for many days. About three o'clock in the\nmorning, however, the major observed that the roots now and then struck\nthe bottom. Tom Austin, by means of a long branch, carefully sounded,\nand declared that the water was growing shallow. Twenty minutes later,\na shock was felt, and the progress of the tree was checked. \"Land! land!\" cried Paganel, in ringing tones. The ends of the charred branches had struck against a hillock on the\nground, and never were navigators more delighted to land. Already\nRobert and Wilson, having reached a firm plateau, were uttering shouts\nof joy, when a well-known whistle was heard. The sound of a horse's\nhoofs was heard upon the plain, and the tall form of the Indian emerged\nfrom the darkness. [Illustration: The sound of a horse's hoofs was heard upon the plain,\nand the tall form of the Indian emerged from the darkness.] \"Thalcave!\" cried Robert. \"Thalcave!\" repeated his companions, as with one voice. \"Friends!\" said the Patagonian, who had waited for them there, knowing\nthat the current would carry them as it had carried him. At the same moment he raised Robert in his arms and clasped him to his\nbreast. Glenarvan, the major, and the sailors, delighted to see their\nfaithful guide again, shook his hands with the most earnest cordiality. The Patagonian then conducted them to an abandoned estancia.", "similarity": 0.20044821500778198}, {"chunk_id": 222, "text": "The whole peak trembled, and you might almost have thought that\nit was disappearing in a general conflagration. Glenarvan and his companions had scarcely time to escape the shock of\nthe eruption. They fled to the inclosure of the tomb, but not without\nreceiving a few scalding drops of the water, which bubbled and exhaled\na strong sulphureous odor. Then mud, lava, and volcanic fragments mingled in the scene of\ndevastation. Torrents of flame furrowed the sides of the Maunganamu. The adjoining mountains glowed in the light of the eruption, and the\ndeep valleys were illumined with a vivid brightness. The savages were soon aroused, both by the noise and the heat\nof the lava that flowed in a scalding tide through the midst of\ntheir encampment. Those whom the fiery flood had not reached fled,\nand ascended the surrounding hills, turning and gazing back at\nthis terrific phenomenon, with which their god, in his wrath, had\noverwhelmed the desecrators of the sacred mountain; while at certain\nmoments they were heard howling their consecratory cry:\n\n\"Taboo! taboo! taboo!\" [Illustration: The fugitives made themselves levers out of the stakes\nof the tomb.] [Illustration: An incandescent column poured forth towards the sky with\nloud explosions, while streams of boiling water and lava rolled towards\nthe encampment of the natives.] Meantime an enormous quantity of vapor, melted stones, and lava had\nescaped from the crater. It was no longer a simple geyser. All this\nvolcanic effervescence had hitherto been confined beneath the crust of\nthe peak, since the outlets of Tangariro sufficed for its expansion;\nbut as a new opening had been made, it had rushed forth with extreme\nviolence. All night long, during the storm that raged above and below, the peak\nwas shaken with a commotion that could not but alarm Glenarvan. The\nprisoners, concealed behind the palisade of the tomb, watched the\nfearful progress of the outbreak. Morning came. The fury of the volcano had not moderated. Thick,\nyellowish vapors mingled with the flames, and torrents of lava poured\nin every direction. Glenarvan, with eye alert and beating heart,\nglanced between the interstices of the inclosure, and surveyed the camp\nof the Maoris. The natives had fled to the neighboring plateaus, beyond the reach of\nthe volcano. Several corpses, lying at the foot of the peak, had been\ncharred by the fire. Farther on, towards the pah, the lava had consumed\na number of huts, that were still smoking. The savages, in scattered\ngroups, were gazing at the vapory summit of Maunganamu with religious\nawe. Kai-Koumou came into the midst of his warriors, and Glenarvan\nrecognized him. The chief advanced to the base of the peak, on the side\nspared by the eruption, but did not cross the first slopes. Here, with\noutstretched arms, like a sorcerer exorcising, he made a few grimaces,\nthe meaning of which did not escape the prisoners. As Paganel had\nforeseen, Kai-Koumou was invoking upon the mountain a more rigorous\ntaboo. Soon after, the natives descended, in single file, the winding paths\nthat led towards the pah. [Sidenote: A WEARY WAITING.] \"They are going!\" cried Glenarvan. \"They are abandoning their post! God be thanked! Our scheme has succeeded! My dear Helena, my brave\ncompanions, we are now dead and buried; but this evening we will\nrevive, we will leave our tomb, and flee from these barbarous tribes!\" It would be difficult to describe the joy that reigned within the\npalisade. Hope had reanimated all hearts.", "similarity": 0.2516923248767853}, {"chunk_id": 206, "text": "But on the third day the huts were opened.

The crowd of natives\nformed a semicircle around him, and the whole assembly preserved\nabsolute silence. At a sign from the chief, a warrior advanced towards the temple. \"Remember!\" said Lady Helena to her husband. Glenarvan clasped his wife to his heart. At this moment Mary Grant\napproached John Mangles. \"Lord and Lady Glenarvan,\" said she, \"I think that, if a wife can die\nby the hand of her husband to escape a degrading existence, a maiden\ncan likewise die by the hand of her lover. John (for I may tell you\nat this critical moment), have I not long been your betrothed in the\ndepths of your heart? May I rely upon you, dear John, as Lady Helena\ndoes upon Lord Glenarvan?\" \"Mary!\" cried the young captain, in terror. \"Ah! dear Mary----\"\n\nHe could not finish: the mat was raised, and the captives were dragged\ntowards Kai-Koumou. The two women were resigned to their fate, while\nthe men concealed their anguish beneath a calmness that showed\nsuperhuman self-control. They came before the chief, who did not delay\nsentence. \"You killed Kara-Tété!\" said he to Glenarvan. \"I did.\" [Sidenote: THE BEGINNING OF THE END.] \"You shall die to-morrow at sunrise.\" \"Alone?\" inquired Glenarvan, whose heart beat quickly. \"What! as if our Tohonga's life were not more precious than yours!\" cried Kai-Koumou, whose eyes expressed a fierce regret. At this moment a commotion took place among the natives. Glenarvan cast\na rapid glance around him. The crowd opened, and a warrior, dripping\nwith sweat and overcome with fatigue, appeared. As soon as Kai-Koumou perceived him, he said in English, evidently that\nhe might be understood by the captives:\n\n\"You come from the camp of the pale-faces?\" \"Yes,\" replied the Maori. \"You saw the prisoner, our Tohonga?\" \"I did.\" \"Is he living?\" \"He is dead! The English have shot him.\" The fate of Glenarvan and his companions was settled. \"You shall all die to-morrow at daybreak!\" cried Kai-Koumou. The unfortunates were therefore to suffer a common death. Lady Helena\nand Mary Grant raised towards heaven a look of thankfulness. The captives were not taken back to the temple. They were to attend\nthat day the funeral of the dead chief, and the bloody ceremonies\nconnected therewith. A party of natives conducted them to the foot of\nan enormous koudi, where these guardians remained without losing sight\nof their prisoners. The rest of the tribe, absorbed in their official\nmourning, seemed to have forgotten them. The customary three days had elapsed since the death of Kara-Tété. The\nsoul of the deceased had therefore forever abandoned its mortal abode. The sacred rites began. The body was carried to a small mound in the centre of the\nfortification, clothed in splendid costume, and enveloped in a\nmagnificent flaxen mat. The head was adorned with plumes, and wore a\ncrown of green leaves. The face, arms, and breast had been rubbed with\noil, and therefore showed no mortification.

BETWEEN FIRE AND WATER. Jacques Paganel's story had a very great success. He was greatly\napplauded, but each retained his own opinion, and the geographer\nobtained the result common to most discussions,--of convincing nobody. However, they were agreed on this point, that it was necessary to have\ncourage for every fortune, and be contented with a tree when one has\nneither palace nor cottage. During the course of this confabulation evening had come on. Only a\ngood sleep could thoroughly refresh, after this eventful day. The\ninmates of the tree felt themselves not only fatigued by the sudden\nchanges of the inundation, but especially overcome by the heat, which\nhad been excessive. Their feathered companions had already set the\nexample; the hilgueros, those nightingales of the Pampas, had ceased\ntheir melodious warblings, and all the birds had disappeared in the\nrecesses of the foliage. The best plan was to imitate them. But before \"retiring to their nest,\" as Paganel said, Glenarvan,\nRobert, and he climbed to the observatory, to examine for the last\ntime the watery expanse. It was about nine o'clock. The sun had just\nset in the sparkling mists of the horizon, and all the western part\nof the firmament was bathed in a warm vapor. The constellations,\nusually so dazzling, seemed veiled in a soft haze. Still they could\nbe distinguished, and Paganel pointed out to Robert, for Glenarvan's\nbenefit, that zone where the stars are most brilliant. [Sidenote: PHILOSOPHY AND PONCHOS.] While the geographer was discoursing thus, the whole eastern horizon\nassumed a stormy aspect. A dense and dark band, clearly defined,\ngradually rose, dimming the light of the stars. This cloud of\nthreatening appearance soon invaded almost the entire vault of the sky. Its motive power must have been inherent in itself, for there was not\na breath of wind. Not a leaf stirred on the tree, not a ripple curled\nthe surface of the waters. Even the air seemed to fail, as if some\nhuge pneumatic machine had rarefied it. A strong electric current was\nperceptible in the atmosphere, and every creature felt it course along\nthe nerves. Glenarvan, Paganel, and Robert were sensibly affected by\nthese electric currents. \"We shall have a storm,\" said Paganel. \"You are not afraid of thunder?\" asked Glenarvan of the boy. \"Oh, no, my lord,\" replied Robert. \"Well, so much the better; for the storm is now not far distant.\" \"And it will be violent,\" continued Paganel, \"so far as I can judge\nfrom the state of the sky.\" \"It is not the storm that troubles me,\" said Glenarvan, \"but the\ntorrents of rain with which it will be accompanied. We shall be\ndrenched to the skin again. Whatever you may say, Paganel, a nest\ncannot suffice a man, as you will soon learn to your cost.\" \"Oh, yes, it can, with philosophy,\" briskly replied the geographer. \"Philosophy does not prevent you from getting wet.\" \"No, but it warms you.\" \"Well, then,\" said Glenarvan, \"let us join our friends and persuade\nthem to envelop us with their philosophy and their ponchos as closely\nas possible, and especially to lay in a stock of patience, for we shall\nneed it.\" So saying, he gave another look at the threatening sky. The mass of\nclouds now covered it entirely. A faint line of light towards the\nhorizon was scarcely discernible in the dimness.

The rising sun awakened with his first rays the sleepers on the\nMaunganamu. The Maoris for some time had been moving to and fro at the\nfoot of the peak without wandering from their post of observation. Furious cries saluted the appearance of the Europeans as they issued\nfrom the desecrated tomb. Each cast a longing glance towards the surrounding mountains, the deep\nvalleys, still veiled in mist, and the surface of Lake Taupo, gently\nrippling beneath the morning wind. Then all, eager to know Paganel's\nnew project, gathered around him with questioning looks; while the\ngeographer at once satisfied the restless curiosity of his companions. \"My friends,\" said he, \"my project has this advantage, that if it does\nnot produce the result that I expect, or even fails, our situation will\nnot be impaired. But it ought to and will succeed.\" \"And this project?\" asked the major. \"This is it,\" replied Paganel. \"The superstition of the natives has\nmade this mountain a place of refuge, and this superstition must help\nus to escape. If I succeed in convincing Kai-Koumou that we have become\nthe victims of our sacrilege, that the wrath of Heaven has fallen upon\nus, in short, that we have met a terrible death, do you think that he\nwill abandon the mountain and return to his village?\" \"Probably,\" said Glenarvan. \"And with what horrible death do you threaten us?\" inquired Lady Helena. \"The death of the sacrilegious, my friends,\" continued Paganel. \"The\navenging flames are under our feet. Let us open a way for them.\" \"What! you would make a volcano?\" cried Captain Mangles. \"Yes, a factitious, an improvised one, whose fury we will control. There is quite a supply of vapors and subterranean fires that only\nask for an outlet. Let us arrange an artificial eruption for our own\nadvantage.\" \"The idea is good,\" said the major, \"and well conceived, Paganel.\" \"You understand,\" resumed the geographer, \"that we are to feign being\nconsumed by the flames of Pluto, and shall disappear spiritually in the\ntomb of Kara-Tété.\" [Sidenote: A VOLCANO IN MINIATURE.] \"Where we shall remain three, four, or five days, if necessary, till\nthe savages are convinced of our death, and abandon the siege.\" \"But if they think of making sure of our destruction,\" said Miss Grant,\n\"and climb the mountain?\" \"No, my dear Mary,\" replied Paganel, \"they will not do that.

But this is scarcely probable, especially if we play our part\nskillfully.\" \"And when shall we make this last venture?\" asked Lady Helena. \"This very evening,\" answered Paganel, \"at the hour of the greatest\ndarkness.\" \"Agreed,\" said MacNabb. \"Paganel, you are a man of genius; and although\nfrom habit I am scarcely ever enthusiastic, I will answer for your\nsuccess. Ha! these rascals! we shall perform a little miracle for them\nthat will delay their conversion a good century.

But for the eternal life his faithful spouse could\nnot alone suffice the deceased. Who would serve them in presence of\nNouï-Atoua, if their slaves did not follow them?

During the life of the chief they had undergone the\nseverest privations, suffered a thousand abuses, had been scantily fed,\nand compelled constantly to labor like beasts; and now, according to\nthe Maori belief, they were to continue their existence of servitude\nfor eternity.

Moreover, this\ndeath was rapid, protracted sufferings were spared them. These were\nreserved for the captives who stood trembling not twenty paces distant. Six blows of the méré, given by six stalwart warriors, stretched the\nvictims on the ground in a pool of blood.

The French ships being greatly out of repair, Marion was induced to\nfell timber at some distance in the interior, and to establish in this\noccupation a great number of his men, going frequently to them, and\nremaining with them and the apparently friendly chiefs.

Each cast a longing glance towards the surrounding mountains, the deep\nvalleys, still veiled in mist, and the surface of Lake Taupo, gently\nrippling beneath the morning wind. Then all, eager to know Paganel's\nnew project, gathered around him with questioning looks; while the\ngeographer at once satisfied the restless curiosity of his companions. \"My friends,\" said he, \"my project has this advantage, that if it does\nnot produce the result that I expect, or even fails, our situation will\nnot be impaired. But it ought to and will succeed.\" \"And this project?\" asked the major. \"This is it,\" replied Paganel. \"The superstition of the natives has\nmade this mountain a place of refuge, and this superstition must help\nus to escape. If I succeed in convincing Kai-Koumou that we have become\nthe victims of our sacrilege, that the wrath of Heaven has fallen upon\nus, in short, that we have met a terrible death, do you think that he\nwill abandon the mountain and return to his village?\" \"Probably,\" said Glenarvan. \"And with what horrible death do you threaten us?\" inquired Lady Helena. \"The death of the sacrilegious, my friends,\" continued Paganel. \"The\navenging flames are under our feet. Let us open a way for them.\" \"What! you would make a volcano?\" cried Captain Mangles. \"Yes, a factitious, an improvised one, whose fury we will control. There is quite a supply of vapors and subterranean fires that only\nask for an outlet. Let us arrange an artificial eruption for our own\nadvantage.\" \"The idea is good,\" said the major, \"and well conceived, Paganel.\" \"You understand,\" resumed the geographer, \"that we are to feign being\nconsumed by the flames of Pluto, and shall disappear spiritually in the\ntomb of Kara-Tété.\" [Sidenote: A VOLCANO IN MINIATURE.] \"Where we shall remain three, four, or five days, if necessary, till\nthe savages are convinced of our death, and abandon the siege.\" \"But if they think of making sure of our destruction,\" said Miss Grant,\n\"and climb the mountain?\" \"No, my dear Mary,\" replied Paganel, \"they will not do that.

The\nprisoners were stationed in the centre of the encampment, and guarded\nwith extreme vigilance. The next morning the ascent of the Waikato was resumed. Other boats\ncame from various affluents of the river. Sixty warriors, evidently\nfugitives from the last insurrection, had now assembled, and were\nreturning, more or less wounded in the fray, to the mountain districts. Sometimes a song arose from the canoes, as they advanced in single\nfile. One native struck up the patriotic ode of the mysterious \"Pihé,\"\nthe national hymn that calls the Maoris to battle. The full and\nsonorous voice of the singer waked the echoes of the mountains; and\nafter each stanza his comrades struck their breasts, and sang the\nwarlike verses in chorus. Then they seized their oars again, and the\ncanoes were headed up stream. During the day a singular sight enlivened the voyage. About four\no'clock the canoe, without lessening its speed, guided by the steady\nhand of the chief, dashed through a narrow gorge. Eddies broke\nviolently against numerous small islands, which rendered navigation\nexceeding dangerous. Never could it be more hazardous to capsize, for\nthe banks afforded no refuge, and whoever had set foot on the porous\ncrust of the shore would probably have perished. At this point the\nriver flowed between warm springs, oxide of iron colored the muddy\nground a brilliant red, and not a yard of firm earth could be seen. The air was heavy with a penetrating sulphureous odor. The natives did\nnot regard it, but the captives were seriously annoyed by the noxious\nvapors exhaled from the fissures of the soil and the bubbles that\nburst and discharged their gaseous contents. Yet, however disagreeable\nthese emanations were, the eye could not but admire this magnificent\nspectacle. [Illustration: At this point the river flowed between warm springs, and\nnot a yard of firm earth could be seen.] The canoes soon after entered a dense cloud of white smoke, whose\nwreaths rose in gradually decreasing circles above the river. On the\nshores a hundred geysers, some shooting forth masses of vapor, and\nothers overflowing in liquid columns, varied their effects, like the\njets and cascades of a fountain. It seemed as though some engineer was\ndirecting at his pleasure the outflowings of these springs, as the\nwaters and vapor, mingling in the air, formed rainbows in the sunbeams. For two miles the canoes glided within this vapory atmosphere,\nenveloped in its warm waves that rolled along the surface of the water. Then the sulphureous smoke disappeared, and a pure swift current of\nfresh air refreshed the panting voyagers. The region of the springs was\npassed. Before the close of the day two more rapids were ascended, and\nat evening Kai-Koumou encamped a hundred miles above the junction of\nthe two streams. The river now turned towards the east, and then again\nflowed southward into Lake Taupo. The next morning Jacques Paganel consulted his map and discovered\non the right bank Mount Taubara, which rises to the height of three\nthousand feet. At noon the whole fleet of boats entered Lake Taupo, and\nthe natives hailed with frantic gestures a shred of cloth that waved in\nthe wind from the roof of a hut. It was the national flag.

Eight oars at\nthe bow propelled it up the river, while a man at the stern guided it\nby means of a movable paddle. This man was a native, of tall form, about forty-five years old, with\nbroad breast and powerful limbs. His protruding and deeply furrowed\nbrow, his fierce look and his sinister countenance, showed him to be a\nformidable individual. He was a Maori chief of high rank, as could be seen by the delicate\nand compact tattooing that striped his face and body. Two black\nspirals, starting from the nostrils of his aquiline nose, circled his\ntawny eyes, met on his forehead, and were lost in his abundant hair. His mouth, with its shining teeth, and his chin, were hidden beneath\na net-work of varied colors, while graceful lines wound down to his\nsinewy breast. There was no doubt as to his rank. The sharp albatross bone, used\nby Maori tattooers, had furrowed his face five times, in close and\ndeep lines. That he had reached his fifth promotion was evident from\nhis haughty bearing. A large flaxen mat, ornamented with dog-skins,\nenveloped his person; while a girdle, bloody with his recent conflicts,\nencircled his waist. From his ears dangled ear-rings of green jade, and\naround his neck hung necklaces of \"pounamous,\" sacred stones to which\nthe New Zealanders attribute miraculous properties. At his side lay a\ngun of English manufacture, and a \"patou-patou,\" a kind of double-edged\nhatchet. Near him nine warriors, of lower rank, armed and of ferocious aspect,\nsome still suffering from recent wounds, stood in perfect immobility,\nenveloped in their flaxen mantles. Three dogs of wild appearance were\nstretched at their feet. The eight rowers seemed to be servants or\nslaves of the chief. They worked vigorously, and the boat ascended the\ncurrent of the Waikato with remarkable swiftness. In the centre of this long canoe, with feet tied, but hands free, were\nten European prisoners clinging closely to each other. They were Lord\nGlenarvan and his companions.

They were not long in learning, by the aid of a few English words which\nthe natives used, that, being driven back by the British troops, they\nwere returning, vanquished and weakened, to the regions of the upper\nWaikato. Their chief, after an obstinate resistance, in which he lost\nhis principal warriors, was now on his way to rouse again the river\ntribes. He was called Kai-Koumou, a terrible name, which signified\nin the native language \"he who eats the limbs of his enemy.\" He was\nbrave and bold, but his cruelty equaled his bravery. No pity could be\nexpected from him. His name was well known to the English soldiers, and\na price had been set upon his head by the governor of New Zealand.

The waters of the surrounding country have rushed down and\nfilled this enormous cavity, and the abyss has become a lake, whose\ndepth no one has yet been able to measure. Such is this strange Lake Taupo, elevated eleven hundred and fifty\nfeet above the level of the sea, and surrounded by lofty mountains.

But Paganel was scarcely disposed to enlarge his account of these\nwonders, nor were his friends in a mood to listen. They gazed in\nsilence towards the northeast shore of the lake, whither the canoe was\nbringing them. The mission established at Pukawa, on the western shores, no longer\nexisted. The missionary had been driven by the war far from the\nprincipal dwellings of the insurrectionists. The prisoners were\nhelpless, abandoned to the mercy of the vengeful Maoris, and in that\nwild part of the island to which Christianity has never penetrated. Kai-Koumou, leaving the waters of the Waikato, passed through the\nlittle creek which served as an outlet to the river, doubled a sharp\npromontory, and landed on the eastern border of the lake, at the base\nof the first slopes of Mount Manga. A quarter of a mile distant, on a buttress of the mountain, appeared\na \"pah,\" a Maori fortification, situated in an impregnable position.

No pity could be\nexpected from him. His name was well known to the English soldiers, and\na price had been set upon his head by the governor of New Zealand.

However, from a few words exchanged,\nGlenarvan perceived that they were acquainted with the English\nlanguage. He therefore resolved to question the chief in regard to the\nfate that was in store for them.

Paganel also told, at great length, the tales of many of the sad\nincidents which from time to time have marked even the commercial\nintercourse between the European and the Maori; as, for instance, the\nsad tale of conflict and bloodshed connected with the death of Captain\nMarion, a French navigator, in 1772. He had landed near the spot where\nSurville had ill-treated some of the natives and traitorously seized\na son of the chief, Takouri, who yet appeared to welcome this next\nFrench visitant, though remembering none the less the terrible duty of\nvengeance which is felt by the Maori to be so binding. [Illustration: It was on the sixth of October, 1769, that this\nnavigator (Captain Cook) first landed on the shores.] For a long time the cloak of friendship was worn by the natives, the\nmore thoroughly to lull the suspicions of the whites, and to entice a\nlarger number on shore; in which endeavor they succeeded only too well. The French ships being greatly out of repair, Marion was induced to\nfell timber at some distance in the interior, and to establish in this\noccupation a great number of his men, going frequently to them, and\nremaining with them and the apparently friendly chiefs. On one of these\noccasions the Maoris fulfilled their revengeful project with a terrible\nsatisfaction to themselves. Only one man, of all those in the interior,\nmanaged to escape, the commander himself falling a prey to their\nvengeance. They then endeavored to kill the second in command, who,\nwith several others, was nearer to the shore. These, of course, at once\nstarted for their boats; breathless, they reached them, hotly pursued\nto the water's edge by the insatiate savages. Then, safe themselves,\nthe French marksmen picked off the chief, and the previous exultation\nof the aborigines was, even in the hour of their triumph, turned to\nlamentation, coupled with wonder at the terrible power of the white\nman's fire-barrel. [Illustration: Safe themselves, the French marksmen picked off the\nchief.] All this and much more did the geographer narrate; but it must be\nconfessed that he neither spoke, nor did they listen, with the\ncomplacency evinced in his previous tales. Besides, their surroundings\nwere at the time uncomfortable, and the first prognostications of a\nspeedy passage were not likely to be verified. Unfortunately, this painful voyage was prolonged. Six days after her\ndeparture, the Macquarie had not descried the shores of Auckland. The wind was fair, however, and still blew from the southwest; but\nnevertheless the brig did not make much headway. The sea was rough, the\nrigging creaked, the ribs cracked, and the vessel rode the waves with\ndifficulty. Fortunately, Will Halley, like a man who was in no hurry, did not crowd\non sail, or his masts would inevitably have snapped. Captain Mangles\nhoped, therefore, that this clumsy craft would reach its destination\nin safety; still, he was pained to see his companions on board in such\nmiserable quarters.

[Sidenote: ACCESSIONS, AND PROGRESS.] The sun was just sinking below the horizon as the canoe ran upon a bank\nof pumice-stones, which the Waikato carries with it from its source\nin the volcanic mountains. Several trees grew here, as if designed to\nshelter an encampment. Kai-Koumou landed his prisoners. The men had their hands tied, the ladies were free. All were placed\nin the centre of the encampment, around which large fires formed an\nimpassable barrier. Before Kai-Koumou had informed his captives of his intention to\nexchange them, Glenarvan and Captain Mangles had discussed various\nmethods of recovering their liberty. What they could not venture in the\nboat they hoped to attempt on land, at the hour for encamping, under\ncover of the night. But since Glenarvan's conversation with the chief, it seemed wise to\nabandon this design. They must be patient. It was the most prudent\nplan. The exchange offered chances that neither an open attack nor a\nflight across these unknown regions could afford. Many circumstances\nmight indeed arise that would delay, and even prevent, such a\ntransaction; but still it was better to await the result. What,\nmoreover, could ten defenceless men do against thirty well-armed\nsavages? Besides, Glenarvan thought it likely that Kai-Koumou's tribe\nhad lost some chief of high rank whom they were particularly anxious to\nrecover; and he was not mistaken. The next day the canoe ascended the river with increased swiftness. It stopped for a moment at the junction of a small river which wound\nacross the plains on the right bank. Here another canoe, with ten\nnatives on board, joined Kai-Koumou. The warriors merely exchanged\nsalutations, and then continued their course. The new-comers had\nrecently fought against the English troops, as could be seen by their\ntattered garments, their gory weapons, and the wounds that still bled\nbeneath their rags. They were gloomy and taciturn, and, with the\nindifference common to all savage races, paid no attention to the\ncaptives. Towards evening Kai-Koumou landed at the foot of the mountains,\nwhose nearer ridges reached precipitously to the river-bank. Here\ntwenty natives, who had disembarked from their canoes, were making\npreparations for the night. Fires blazed beneath the trees.

The crowd of natives\nformed a semicircle around him, and the whole assembly preserved\nabsolute silence. At a sign from the chief, a warrior advanced towards the temple. \"Remember!\" said Lady Helena to her husband. Glenarvan clasped his wife to his heart. At this moment Mary Grant\napproached John Mangles. \"Lord and Lady Glenarvan,\" said she, \"I think that, if a wife can die\nby the hand of her husband to escape a degrading existence, a maiden\ncan likewise die by the hand of her lover. John (for I may tell you\nat this critical moment), have I not long been your betrothed in the\ndepths of your heart?

The two women were resigned to their fate, while\nthe men concealed their anguish beneath a calmness that showed\nsuperhuman self-control. They came before the chief, who did not delay\nsentence. \"You killed Kara-Tété!\" said he to Glenarvan. \"I did.\" [Sidenote: THE BEGINNING OF THE END.] \"You shall die to-morrow at sunrise.\" \"Alone?\" inquired Glenarvan, whose heart beat quickly. \"What! as if our Tohonga's life were not more precious than yours!\" cried Kai-Koumou, whose eyes expressed a fierce regret. At this moment a commotion took place among the natives. Glenarvan cast\na rapid glance around him. The crowd opened, and a warrior, dripping\nwith sweat and overcome with fatigue, appeared. As soon as Kai-Koumou perceived him, he said in English, evidently that\nhe might be understood by the captives:\n\n\"You come from the camp of the pale-faces?\" \"Yes,\" replied the Maori. \"You saw the prisoner, our Tohonga?\" \"I did.\" \"Is he living?\" \"He is dead! The English have shot him.\" The fate of Glenarvan and his companions was settled. \"You shall all die to-morrow at daybreak!\" cried Kai-Koumou. The unfortunates were therefore to suffer a common death. Lady Helena\nand Mary Grant raised towards heaven a look of thankfulness. The captives were not taken back to the temple. They were to attend\nthat day the funeral of the dead chief, and the bloody ceremonies\nconnected therewith. A party of natives conducted them to the foot of\nan enormous koudi, where these guardians remained without losing sight\nof their prisoners. The rest of the tribe, absorbed in their official\nmourning, seemed to have forgotten them. The customary three days had elapsed since the death of Kara-Tété. The\nsoul of the deceased had therefore forever abandoned its mortal abode. The sacred rites began. The body was carried to a small mound in the centre of the\nfortification, clothed in splendid costume, and enveloped in a\nmagnificent flaxen mat. The head was adorned with plumes, and wore a\ncrown of green leaves. The face, arms, and breast had been rubbed with\noil, and therefore showed no mortification. The parents and friends of the deceased came to the foot of the\nmound, and all at once, as if some director were beating time to a\nfuneral dirge, a great concert of cries, groans, and sobs arose on the\nair.

[Sidenote: A TESTING TIME.] The evening before, the little party, led astray by the dense fog, had\nencamped in the midst of a numerous tribe of natives. About midnight,\nthe travelers, surprised in their sleep, were made prisoners and\ncarried on board the canoe. They had not yet been maltreated, but had\ntried in vain to resist. Their arms and ammunition were in the hands of\nthe savages, and their own bullets would have quickly stretched them on\nthe earth had they attempted to escape. They were not long in learning, by the aid of a few English words which\nthe natives used, that, being driven back by the British troops, they\nwere returning, vanquished and weakened, to the regions of the upper\nWaikato. Their chief, after an obstinate resistance, in which he lost\nhis principal warriors, was now on his way to rouse again the river\ntribes. He was called Kai-Koumou, a terrible name, which signified\nin the native language \"he who eats the limbs of his enemy.\" He was\nbrave and bold, but his cruelty equaled his bravery. No pity could be\nexpected from him. His name was well known to the English soldiers, and\na price had been set upon his head by the governor of New Zealand.

His\nrelations struck their heads together; his kinswomen lacerated their\nfaces with their nails, and showed themselves more lavish of blood than\nof tears. These unfortunate females conscientiously fulfilled their\nbarbarous duty. But these demonstrations were not enough to appease the soul of the\ndeceased, whose wrath would doubtless have smitten the survivors of his\ntribe; and his warriors, as they could not recall him to life, wished\nthat he should have no cause to regret in the other world the happiness\nof this. Kara-Tété's wife was not to forsake her husband in the tomb. Moreover,\nthe unfortunate woman would not have been allowed to survive him;\nit was the custom, in accordance with duty, and examples of such\nsacrifices are not wanting in New Zealand history. The woman appeared. She was still young. Her hair floated in disorder over her shoulders. Vague words, lamentations, and broken phrases, in which she celebrated\nthe virtues of the dead, interrupted her groans; and, in a final\nparoxysm of grief, she stretched herself at the foot of the mound,\nbeating the ground with her head. At this moment Kai-Koumou approached her. Suddenly the unfortunate\nvictim rose; but a violent blow with the \"méré,\" a formidable club,\nwielded by the hand of the chief, struck her lifeless to the earth.

But no one stirred, for\nthe funeral ceremonies were not ended. Kara-Tété's wife had joined her husband in the other world. Both bodies\nlay side by side. But for the eternal life his faithful spouse could\nnot alone suffice the deceased. Who would serve them in presence of\nNouï-Atoua, if their slaves did not follow them? Six unfortunates were brought before the corpse of their master and\nmistress. They were servants, whom the pitiless laws of war had reduced\nto slavery. During the life of the chief they had undergone the\nseverest privations, suffered a thousand abuses, had been scantily fed,\nand compelled constantly to labor like beasts; and now, according to\nthe Maori belief, they were to continue their existence of servitude\nfor eternity. They appeared to be resigned to their fate, and were not astonished\nat a sacrifice they had long anticipated. Their freedom from all\nbonds showed that they would meet death unresistingly. Moreover, this\ndeath was rapid, protracted sufferings were spared them. These were\nreserved for the captives who stood trembling not twenty paces distant. Six blows of the méré, given by six stalwart warriors, stretched the\nvictims on the ground in a pool of blood. It was the signal for a\nterrible scene of cannibalism, which followed in all its horrible\ndetails. Glenarvan and his companions, breathless with fright, strove to hide\nthis awful scene from the eyes of the two unhappy ladies. They now\nunderstood what awaited them at sunrise the next day, and what cruel\ntortures would doubtless precede such a death. They were dumb with\nhorror. The funeral dance now began.

A year after his arrival\nin the country, Sergeant Manuel was naturalized, joined the Argentine\narmy, and married an honest Indian woman, who had twins,--boys, to be\nsure, for the sergeant's worthy consort would never present him with\ndaughters. Manuel did not think of any other calling than that of the\nsoldier, and hoped, in time, with the help of God, to offer to the\nrepublic a whole battalion of young soldiers. \"You have seen them?\" said he. \"Charming fellows! Good soldiers! José! Juan! Miguel! Pepe! Pepe is only seven years old, and is already biting\nhis cartridge!\" Pepe, hearing himself complimented, joined his two little feet, and\npresented arms with perfect precision. \"He will do!\" added the sergeant. \"He will be a major--or\nbrigadier-general one day!\" This story lasted a quarter of an hour, to Thalcave's great\nastonishment. The Indian could not understand how so many words could\ncome from a single throat. No one interrupted the commander; and even\na French sergeant had to conclude at last, though not without forcing\nhis guests to accompany him to his dwelling. Here they were introduced\nto Madame Ipharaguerre, who appeared to be \"a good-looking person,\" if\nthis expression may be employed in regard to an Indian. When he had exhausted himself, the sergeant asked his guests to what he\nowed the honor of their visit. And now it was their turn to explain. Paganel, opening the conversation in French, told him of their journey\nacross the Pampas, and ended by asking why the Indians had abandoned\nthe country. \"War!\" replied the sergeant. \"War?\" \"Yes, civil war.\" \"Civil war?\" rejoined Paganel. \"Yes, war between Paraguay and Buenos Ayres,\" answered the sergeant. \"Well?\" \"Why, all the Indians of the north are in the rear of General Flores,\nand those of the plains are plundering.\" \"But the caziques?\" \"The caziques with them.\" This answer was reported to Thalcave, who shook his head. Indeed,\nhe either did not know, or had forgotten, that a civil war, which\nwas afterwards to involve Brazil, was decimating two-thirds of the\nrepublic. The Indians had everything to gain in these internal\nstruggles, and could not neglect such fine opportunities for plunder. The sergeant, therefore, was not mistaken in attributing this desertion\nof the Pampas to the civil war that was being waged in the northern\npart of the Argentine Provinces. But this event disconcerted Glenarvan's hopes. If Captain Grant was\na prisoner of the caziques, he must have been carried by them to the\nnorthern frontiers. Yet how and where to find him? Must they attempt\na perilous and almost useless search to the northern limits of the\nPampas? It was a serious matter, which was to be earnestly considered. However, one important question was still to be asked of the sergeant,\nand the major thought of this, while his companions were looking at\neach other in silence. \"Have you heard of any Europeans being retained as prisoners by the\ncaziques of the Pampas?\" Manuel reflected for a few moments, like a man who recalls events to\nrecollection. \"Yes,\" said he, at length. \"Ah!\" cried Glenarvan, conceiving a new hope. [Sidenote: REVELATIONS.] Paganel, MacNabb, Robert, and he now surrounded the sergeant. \"Speak, speak!\" cried they, gazing at him with eagerness even in their\nlooks. \"Several years ago,\" replied Manuel, \"yes,--that is it,--European\nprisoners--but have never seen them.\" \"Several years ago?\" said Glenarvan. \"You are mistaken.

Paganel also told, at great length, the tales of many of the sad\nincidents which from time to time have marked even the commercial\nintercourse between the European and the Maori; as, for instance, the\nsad tale of conflict and bloodshed connected with the death of Captain\nMarion, a French navigator, in 1772. He had landed near the spot where\nSurville had ill-treated some of the natives and traitorously seized\na son of the chief, Takouri, who yet appeared to welcome this next\nFrench visitant, though remembering none the less the terrible duty of\nvengeance which is felt by the Maori to be so binding. [Illustration: It was on the sixth of October, 1769, that this\nnavigator (Captain Cook) first landed on the shores.] For a long time the cloak of friendship was worn by the natives, the\nmore thoroughly to lull the suspicions of the whites, and to entice a\nlarger number on shore; in which endeavor they succeeded only too well. The French ships being greatly out of repair, Marion was induced to\nfell timber at some distance in the interior, and to establish in this\noccupation a great number of his men, going frequently to them, and\nremaining with them and the apparently friendly chiefs. On one of these\noccasions the Maoris fulfilled their revengeful project with a terrible\nsatisfaction to themselves. Only one man, of all those in the interior,\nmanaged to escape, the commander himself falling a prey to their\nvengeance. They then endeavored to kill the second in command, who,\nwith several others, was nearer to the shore. These, of course, at once\nstarted for their boats; breathless, they reached them, hotly pursued\nto the water's edge by the insatiate savages. Then, safe themselves,\nthe French marksmen picked off the chief, and the previous exultation\nof the aborigines was, even in the hour of their triumph, turned to\nlamentation, coupled with wonder at the terrible power of the white\nman's fire-barrel.

Six days after her\ndeparture, the Macquarie had not descried the shores of Auckland. The wind was fair, however, and still blew from the southwest; but\nnevertheless the brig did not make much headway. The sea was rough, the\nrigging creaked, the ribs cracked, and the vessel rode the waves with\ndifficulty. Fortunately, Will Halley, like a man who was in no hurry, did not crowd\non sail, or his masts would inevitably have snapped. Captain Mangles\nhoped, therefore, that this clumsy craft would reach its destination\nin safety; still, he was pained to see his companions on board in such\nmiserable quarters.

Trees thronged the valley in great numbers. The major chose a group of\nlofty carob-trees, under which was established a temporary encampment. A few blankets, the arms, a little dried meat, and some rice, was\nall that remained to the travelers. A stream, which flowed not far\noff, furnished water, still muddy from the effects of the avalanche. Mulready kindled a fire on the grass, and soon presented to his master\na warm and comforting repast. But Glenarvan refused it, and remained\nstretched on his poncho in profound prostration. Thus the day passed. Night came, clear and calm as the preceding. While\nhis companions lay motionless, although wakeful, Glenarvan reascended\nthe mountain. He listened closely, still hoping that a last cry might\nreach him. He ventured alone and afar, pressing his ear to the ground,\nlistening, restraining the beatings of his heart, and calling in a\nvoice of despair. The whole night long he wandered on the mountain. Sometimes Paganel,\nsometimes the major, followed him, ready to help him on the slippery\nsummits, or on the edge of the chasms, where his rashness led him. But\nhis last efforts were fruitless; and to the cry of \"Robert! Robert!\" a\nthousand times repeated, echo alone replied. Day dawned, and it was necessary to go in search of Glenarvan on\nthe mountain, and bring him in spite of his reluctance back to the\nencampment. His despair was terrible. Who would now dare to speak\nto him of departure, and propose leaving this fatal valley? But the\nprovisions were failing. They would soon meet the Argentine guides\nand horses to take them across the Pampas. To retrace their steps was\nmore difficult than to advance. Besides, the Atlantic was the place\nappointed to meet the Duncan.

At length, words escaped his lips. \"Go?\" said he. \"Yes, go.\" \"One hour more!\" \"Well, one hour more,\" replied the worthy major. When it had passed, Glenarvan asked for another. You would have thought\na condemned man was praying for his life. Thus it continued till about\nnoon, when MacNabb, by the advice of all, would no longer hesitate, and\ntold Glenarvan that they must go, the lives of his companions depended\nupon a prompt decision. \"Yes, yes,\" replied Glenarvan, \"we will go, we will go!\" But as he spoke his eyes were turned away from MacNabb. His gaze was\nfixed upon a black speck in the air. Suddenly his hand rose, and\nremained immovable, as if petrified. \"There! there!\" cried he. \"See! see!\" [Illustration: The bird had raised him by his garments, and was now\nhovering in mid-air at least one hundred and fifty feet above the\nencampment.

The width likewise of this stream was so considerable that it\nwas almost impossible for their horses to swim across; but they happily\ndiscovered a sort of weir-bridge, of wattles looped and fastened\ntogether, which the Indians were in the habit of using; and by its aid\nthe little troop was enabled to pass over to the left bank, where they\nrested for the night.

The horses advanced at a brisk pace among\nthe tufts of \"paja-brava,\" a kind of grass that serves the Indians\nas a shelter during the storms. At certain distances, but less and\nless frequent, pools of shallow water contributed to the growth of\nwillows and a certain plant which is found in the neighborhood of\nfresh water. Here the horses drank their fill, to fortify themselves\nfor the journey. Thalcave, who rode in advance, beat the bushes, and\nthus frightened away the \"cholinas\" (vipers), while the agile Thaouka\nbounded over all obstacles, and aided his master in clearing a passage\nfor the horses that followed. [Illustration: They set out at daybreak. The horses advanced at a brisk\npace among the tufts of \"paja-brava,\" a kind of grass that serves the\nIndians as a shelter during the storms.] Early in the afternoon, the first traces of animals were\nencountered--the bones of an innumerable drove of cattle, in whitened\nheaps. These fragments did not extend in a winding line, such as\nanimals exhausted and falling one by one would leave behind them. Thus\nno one, not even Paganel, knew how to explain this chain of skeletons\nin a space comparatively circumscribed. He therefore questioned\nThalcave, who was not at a loss for a reply. \"What is this?\" they asked, after Paganel had inquired of the Indian. \"The fire of heaven,\" replied the geographer. \"What! the lightning could not have produced such a disaster,\" said Tom\nAustin, \"and stretched five hundred head of cattle on the earth!\" But Thalcave reaffirmed it, and he was not mistaken; for the storms of\nthe Pampas are noted for their violence. At evening they stopped at an abandoned rancho, made of interlaced\nbranches plastered with mud and covered with thatch. This structure\nstood within an inclosure of half-rotten stakes which, however,\nsufficed to protect the horses during the night against the attacks of\nthe foxes. Not that they had anything to fear personally from these\nanimals, but the malicious beasts gnawed the halters, so that the\nhorses could escape. A few paces from the rancho, a hole was dug which served as a kitchen\nand contained half-cooled embers. Within, there was a bench, a bed of\nox-hide, a saucepan, a spit, and a pot for boiling maté. The maté is\na drink very much in use in South America. It is the Indian's tea,\nconsisting of a decoction of leaves dried in the fire, and is imbibed\nthrough a straw. At Paganel's request, Thalcave prepared several\ncups of this beverage, which very agreeably accompanied the ordinary\neatables, and was declared excellent.

It had a small head, flat body, long legs\nand claws, fine coffee-colored hair, and its breast was spotted with\nwhite. Scarcely had Paganel looked at it when he exclaimed,--\n\n\"It is a guanaco!\" \"What is that?\" asked Glenarvan. \"An animal that eats itself.\" \"And is it good?\" [Sidenote: \"A DISH FOR THE GODS.\"] \"Delicious! a dish for the gods! I knew well that you would like fresh\nmeat for supper. And what meat this is! But who will dress the animal?\" \"I will,\" said Wilson. \"Well, I will engage to broil it,\" replied Paganel. \"You are a cook, then, Monsieur Paganel?\" said Robert. \"Certainly, my boy. A Frenchman is always a cook.\" In a little while Paganel placed large slices of meat on the coals,\nand, in a short time, served up to his companions this appetizing\nviand. No one hesitated, but each attacked it ravenously. To the great\namazement of the geographer, a general grimace accompanied by a \"pwah!\" followed the first mouthful. \"It is horrible!\" said one. \"It is not eatable!\" replied another. The poor geographer, whatever was the difficulty, was forced to agree\nthat this steak was not acceptable even to starving men. They therefore\nbegan to launch jokes at him, and deride his \"dish for the gods,\" while\nhe himself sought a reason for this unaccountable result. \"I have it!\" he cried. \"I have it!\" \"Is the meat too old?\" asked MacNabb, calmly. \"No, my intolerant major; but it has traveled too much. How could I\nforget that?\" \"What do you mean?\" asked Tom Austin. \"I mean that the animal is not good unless killed when at rest. I\ncan affirm from the taste that it has come from a distance, and,\nconsequently, the whole herd.\" \"You are certain of this?\" said Glenarvan. \"Absolutely so.\" \"But what event could have terrified these animals so, and driven them\nat a time when they ought to be peacefully sleeping in their lairs.\" \"As to that, my dear Glenarvan,\" said Paganel, \"it is impossible for me\nto say. If you believe me, let us search no farther. For my part I am\ndying for want of sleep. Let us retire, major!\" \"Very well, Paganel.\" Thereupon each wrapped himself in his poncho, the fuel was replenished\nfor the night, and soon all but Glenarvan were buried in profound\nrepose. He alone did not sleep. A secret uneasiness held him in a state of\nwakeful fatigue. He could not help thinking of that herd, flying in one\ncommon direction, of their inexplicable terror. They could not have\nbeen pursued by wild beasts: at that height there were scarcely any,\nand yet fewer hunters. What fright had driven them over the abysses\nof Antuco, and what was the cause of it? He thought of their strange\nsituation, and felt a presentiment of coming danger. However, under the influence of a partial drowsiness, his ideas\ngradually modified, and fear gave place to hope. He saw himself in\nanticipation, on the morrow, on the plain at the foot of the Andes. There his actual search was to begin; and success was not, perhaps, far\ndistant. He thought of Captain Grant and his two sailors, delivered\nfrom a cruel slavery.

He doubtless thought\nof it, but probably did not like to leave his two companions alone in\nthe midst of this desert, and, that he might not outstrip them, he\nforced Thaouka to lessen his speed. It was not, however, without much\nresistance, prancing and neighing, that Thalcave's horse consented to\nkeep pace with the others. It was not so much the strength as the voice\nof his master which restrained him; the Indian actually talked to his\nhorse; and the animal, if he did not answer, at least comprehended\nhim. The Patagonian must have used excellent arguments, for, after\n\"discussing\" some time, Thaouka yielded, and obeyed his master's\ncommands. [Sidenote: GAINED AT LAST.] But, if Thaouka understood Thalcave, Thalcave had none the less\nunderstood Thaouka. The intelligent animal, through his superior\ninstincts, had perceived a moisture in the air. He inhaled it eagerly,\nand kept moving his tongue, as if it were steeped in a grateful liquid. The Patagonian could not be deceived; water was not far distant. He therefore encouraged his companions by explaining the impatience of\nhis horse, which the others were not long in understanding. They made a\nfinal effort, and galloped after the Indian. About three o'clock a bright line appeared in a hollow of the plain. It\ntrembled under the rays of the sun. \"Water!\" cried Glenarvan. \"Water, yes, water!\" cried Robert. They had no more need to urge their horses. The poor beasts, feeling\ntheir strength renewed, rushed forward with an irresistible eagerness. In a few moments they had reached the Guamini River, and, saddled as\nthey were, plunged to their breasts into the cooling stream. Their\nmasters imitated their example, without reluctance, and took an\nafternoon bath which was as healthful as it was pleasant. [Illustration]\n\n\"Ah, how good it is!\" said Robert, as he quenched his thirst in the\nmiddle of the river. \"Be moderate, my boy,\" said Glenarvan, who did not set a good example. Nothing was heard but the sound of rapid drinking.

He had very fortunately found on the banks of the river a\n\"ramada,\" a kind of inclosure designed for a cattle-fold and shut in\non three sides. The situation was excellent for the purpose, so long\nas one did not fear to sleep in the open air; and that was the least\nanxiety of Thalcave's companions.

This course would lead them through\ndistricts that were very rarely visited. The travelers, who were\nalready accustomed to overcoming natural difficulties, only feared\nmeeting the Maoris. They therefore determined to avoid them at all\nhazards, and gain the eastern coast, where the missionaries have\nfounded several establishments. Moreover, this portion of the island\nhad hitherto escaped the ravages of the war and the depredations of the\nnatives. As for the distance that separated Lake Taupo from the Bay of\nPlenty, it could not be more than one hundred miles. Ten days would\nsuffice for the journey.

They stopped at the least sound,--they examined the faintest\nlight; each slid down the declivity, the better to elude detection. Two hundred feet below the summit, Captain Mangles and his sailor\nreached the dangerous ridge that had been so obstinately guarded by the\nnatives. If, unfortunately, the Maoris, more crafty than the fugitives,\nhad feigned a retreat to entice them within reach, if they had not\nbeen deceived by the eruption, their presence would be discovered\nat this point. Glenarvan, in spite of his confidence and Paganel's\npleasantries, could not help trembling. The safety of his friends was\nat stake during the few moments necessary to cross the ridge. He felt\nLady Helena's heart beat as she clung to his arm. But neither he nor Captain Mangles thought of retreating. The young\ncaptain, followed by the others, and favored by the dense obscurity,\ncrawled along the narrow path, only stopping when some detached stone\nrolled to the base of the mountain. If the savages were still in\nambush, these unusual sounds would provoke from each side a formidable\nvolley. However, in gliding like serpents along this inclined crest, the\nfugitives could not advance rapidly.

It was not, however, without much\nresistance, prancing and neighing, that Thalcave's horse consented to\nkeep pace with the others. It was not so much the strength as the voice\nof his master which restrained him; the Indian actually talked to his\nhorse; and the animal, if he did not answer, at least comprehended\nhim. The Patagonian must have used excellent arguments, for, after\n\"discussing\" some time, Thaouka yielded, and obeyed his master's\ncommands. [Sidenote: GAINED AT LAST.] But, if Thaouka understood Thalcave, Thalcave had none the less\nunderstood Thaouka. The intelligent animal, through his superior\ninstincts, had perceived a moisture in the air. He inhaled it eagerly,\nand kept moving his tongue, as if it were steeped in a grateful liquid. The Patagonian could not be deceived; water was not far distant. He therefore encouraged his companions by explaining the impatience of\nhis horse, which the others were not long in understanding. They made a\nfinal effort, and galloped after the Indian. About three o'clock a bright line appeared in a hollow of the plain. It\ntrembled under the rays of the sun. \"Water!\" cried Glenarvan. \"Water, yes, water!\" cried Robert. They had no more need to urge their horses. The poor beasts, feeling\ntheir strength renewed, rushed forward with an irresistible eagerness. In a few moments they had reached the Guamini River, and, saddled as\nthey were, plunged to their breasts into the cooling stream. Their\nmasters imitated their example, without reluctance, and took an\nafternoon bath which was as healthful as it was pleasant. [Illustration]\n\n\"Ah, how good it is!\" said Robert, as he quenched his thirst in the\nmiddle of the river. \"Be moderate, my boy,\" said Glenarvan, who did not set a good example. Nothing was heard but the sound of rapid drinking. As for Thalcave,\nhe drank quietly, without hurrying, long and deeply, till they might\nperhaps fear that the stream would be drained. \"Well,\" said Glenarvan, \"our friends will not be disappointed in their\nexpectations. They are sure, on arriving at the Guamini, to find an\nabundance of clear water, if Thalcave leaves any!\" \"But could we not go to meet them?\" asked Robert. \"We could spare them\nseveral hours of anxiety.\" \"Doubtless, my boy; but how carry the water? Wilson has charge of the\nwater-bottles. No, it is better to wait, as we agreed. Calculating the\nnecessary time, and the slow pace of the horses, our friends will be\nhere at night. Let us, then, prepare them a safe shelter and a good\nrepast.\" Thalcave had not waited for Glenarvan's orders to search for a place\nto encamp. He had very fortunately found on the banks of the river a\n\"ramada,\" a kind of inclosure designed for a cattle-fold and shut in\non three sides. The situation was excellent for the purpose, so long\nas one did not fear to sleep in the open air; and that was the least\nanxiety of Thalcave's companions. Thus they did not seek a better\nretreat, but stretched themselves on the ground in the sun to dry their\nwater-soaked garments. \"Well, since here is shelter,\" said Glenarvan, \"let us think of supper.", "similarity": 0.43637949228286743}, {"chunk_id": 22, "text": "What is\nhe doing?

The latter continued, with more animation:\n\n\"Permit me to shake hands with you, and if I did not do so day before\nyesterday, it was that no one might be embarrassed at the moment of\ndeparture. But to-day, captain, I am truly happy to meet you.\" Captain Mangles opened his eyes in measureless astonishment, looking\nfirst at Olbinett, and then at the new comer. \"Now,\" continued the latter, \"the introduction is over, and we are old\nfriends. Let us have a talk; and tell me, are you satisfied with the\nScotia?\" \"What do you mean by the Scotia?\" asked the captain, at last. \"Why, the Scotia that carries us: a good ship, whose commander, the\nbrave Captain Burton, I have heard praised no less for his physical\nthan his moral qualities. Are you the father of the great African\ntraveler of that name? If so, my compliments!\" \"Sir,\" replied Captain Mangles, \"not only am I not the father of the\ntraveler Burton, but I am not even Captain Burton.\" \"Ah!\" said the unknown, \"it is the mate of the Scotia then, Mr.\nBurdness, whom I am addressing at this moment?\" \"Mr. Burdness?\" replied Captain Mangles, who began to suspect the\ntruth. But was he talking to a fool, or a rogue? This was a question in\nhis mind, and he was about to explain himself intelligibly, when Lord\nGlenarvan, his wife, and Miss Grant came on deck. The stranger perceived them, and cried,--\n\n\"Ah! passengers! passengers! excellent! I hope, Mr. Burdness, you are\ngoing to introduce me----\"\n\nAnd advancing with perfect ease, without waiting for the captain,--\n\n\"Madam\" said he to Miss Grant, \"Miss\" to Lady Helena, \"Sir\" he added,\naddressing Lord Glenarvan. \"Lord Glenarvan,\" said Captain Mangles. \"My lord,\" continued the unknown, \"I beg your pardon for introducing\nmyself, but at sea we must relax a little from etiquette. I hope we\nshall soon be acquainted, and that, in the society of these ladies, the\npassage of the Scotia will seem as short to us as agreeable.\" Lady Helena and Miss Grant could not find a word to answer. They were\ncompletely bewildered by the presence of this intruder. \"Sir,\" said Glenarvan, at length, \"whom have I the honor of addressing?\" \"Jacques Eliacim François Marie Paganel, secretary of the Geographical\nSociety of Paris; corresponding member of the societies of Berlin,\nBombay, Darmstadt, Leipsic, London, St. Petersburg, Vienna, and New\nYork; honorary member of the Royal Geographical and Ethnographical\nInstitute of the East Indies, who, after passing twenty years of his\nlife in studying geography, designs now to enter upon a roving life,\nand is directing his course to India to continue there the labors of\nthe great travelers.\" CHAPTER VII. JACQUES PAGANEL IS UNDECEIVED. The secretary of the Geographical Society must have been an agreeable\nperson, for all this was said with much modesty.

The\nlatter, accordingly, slid gently down the slope, and soon Lady Helena\nand he stood on the narrow path where Robert was waiting for them. The\nrope was shaken three times, and next Captain Mangles, followed by Mary\nGrant, took the same perilous course. They were successful, and joined\nLord and Lady Glenarvan. Five minutes later all the fugitives, after their fortunate escape\nfrom the hut, left this temporary retreat, and, avoiding the inhabited\nshores of the lake, made their way by narrow paths farther down the\nmountain. They advanced rapidly, seeking to avoid all points where they\nmight be seen. They did not speak, but glided like shadows through the\nbushes. Where were they going? At random, it is true, but they were\nfree. About five o'clock day began to break. Purple tints colored the lofty\nbanks of clouds. The mountain peaks emerged from the mists of the\nmorning. The orb of day would not be long in appearing, and instead of\nbeing the signal for torture, was to betray the flight of the condemned. Before this dreaded moment arrived it was important that the fugitives\nshould be beyond the reach of the savages. But they could not advance\nquickly, for the paths were steep. Lady Helena scaled the declivities,\nsupported and even carried by Glenarvan, while Mary Grant leaned upon\nthe arm of her betrothed. Robert, happy and triumphant, whose heart was\nfull of joy at his success, took the lead, followed by the two sailors. For half an hour the fugitives wandered at a venture. Paganel was not\nthere to guide them,--Paganel, the object of their fears, whose absence\ncast a dark shadow over their happiness. However, they proceeded\ntowards the east as well as possible, in the face of a magnificent\ndawn. They had soon reached an elevation of five hundred feet above\nLake Taupo, and the morning air at this altitude was keen and cold. Hills and mountains rose one above another in indistinct outlines; but\nGlenarvan only wished to conceal himself and his companions. Afterwards\nthey would see about issuing from this winding labyrinth. [Illustration: They saw, but were also seen.] At last the sun appeared and flashed his first rays into the faces of\nthe fugitives. Suddenly a terrible yelling, the concentrated union of a\nhundred voices, broke forth upon the air. It rose from the pah, whose\nexact position Glenarvan did not now know. Moreover, a thick curtain of\nmist stretched at their feet, and prevented them from distinguishing\nthe valleys below. But the fugitives could not doubt that their escape had been\ndiscovered. Could they elude the pursuit of the natives? Had they been\nperceived? Would their tracks betray them? At this moment the lower strata of vapor rose, enveloping them for an\ninstant in a moist cloud, and they discerned, three hundred feet below\nthem, the frantic crowd of savages. They saw, but were also seen. Renewed yells resounded, mingled with\nbarks; and the whole tribe, after vainly endeavoring to climb the rock,\nrushed out of the inclosure and hastened by the shortest paths in\npursuit of the prisoners, who fled in terror from their vengeance. CHAPTER LII. THE SACRED MOUNTAIN. The summit of the mountain was a hundred feet higher. It was important\nfor the fugitives to reach it, that they might conceal themselves from\nthe sight of the Maoris, on the opposite slope.

Glenarvan, therefore,\nannounced that Ayrton's plan was adopted. \"And now, captain,\" added he, \"do you not think that prudence dictates\nthis course, and that we should encamp on the banks of the river while\nwaiting for the means of conveyance?\" \"Yes,\" replied Captain Mangles, \"if the messenger succeeds in crossing\nthe Snowy, which we cannot cross ourselves.\" All looked at the quartermaster, who smiled with the air of a man who\nknows perfectly well what he is about to do. \"The messenger will not cross the river,\" said he. \"Ah!\" cried Captain Mangles. \"He will strike the Lucknow road, which will take him direct to\nMelbourne.\" \"Two hundred miles on foot!\" exclaimed the captain. \"On horseback,\" continued Ayrton. \"There is one good horse left. It\nwill be a journey of but four days. Add two days for the Duncan to\nreach the bay, twenty-four hours for the return to the encampment, and\nin a week the messenger will be back again with the crew.\" [Sidenote: CANDIDATES FOR OFFICE.] The major again nodded approvingly at these words, to the great\nastonishment of Captain Mangles. But the quartermaster's proposition\nhad gained all the votes, and the only question was how to execute this\napparently well-conceived plan. \"Now, my friends,\" said Glenarvan, \"it remains only to choose our\nmessenger. He will have a difficult and dangerous mission; that is\ncertain. Who is willing to devote himself for his companions, and carry\nour instructions to Melbourne?\" Wilson, Mulready, Captain Mangles, Paganel, and Robert offered\nthemselves immediately. The captain particularly insisted that this\nmission should be confided to him; but Ayrton, who had not yet\nfinished, resumed the conversation, and said:\n\n\"If it please your lordship, I will go. I am acquainted with the\ncountry, and have often crossed more difficult regions. I can extricate\nmyself where another would fail. I therefore claim, for the common\nwelfare, the right to go to Melbourne. One word will place me on a good\nfooting with your mate, and in six days I engage to bring the Duncan to\nTwofold Bay.\" \"Well said!\" replied Glenarvan. \"You are a brave and intelligent man,\nAyrton, and will succeed.\" The quartermaster was evidently more capable than any one else of\nfulfilling this difficult mission. Captain Mangles raised one final\nobjection, that Ayrton's presence was necessary to enable them to\nfind traces of the Brittania or Captain Grant; but the major observed\nthat they should remain encamped on the banks of the Snowy till the\nmessenger's return, that it was not proposed to resume the search\nwithout him, and that consequently his absence could be in no way\nprejudicial to their interests. \"Well then, Ayrton, start,\" said Glenarvan. \"Make haste, and return to\nthe encampment by way of Eden.\" A gleam of satisfaction seemed to light up the eyes of the\nquartermaster. He turned his head to one side, though not so quickly\nbut that Captain Mangles had intercepted his glance, and instinctively\nfelt his suspicions increased. The quartermaster made his preparations for departure, aided by the\ntwo sailors, one of whom attended to his horse, and the other to his\nprovisions.

When the deluge had passed, the men regained the surface, and\nrapidly counted their numbers; but the horses, except Thaouka, had\ndisappeared forever. \"Courage! courage!\" cried Glenarvan, who supported Paganel with one arm\nand swam with the other. \"All right! all right!\" replied the worthy geographer; \"indeed I am not\nsorry----\"\n\nWhat was he not sorry for? No one ever knew; for the poor man was\nforced to swallow the end of his sentence in half a pint of muddy water. The major calmly advanced, taking a regular stroke of which the most\nskillful swimmer would not have been ashamed. The sailors worked their\nway along like porpoises in their native element. As for Robert, he\nclung to Thaouka's mane, and was thus drawn along. The horse proudly\ncut the waters, and kept himself instinctively on a line with the tree,\ntowards which the current bore him, and which was now not far distant. In a few moments the entire party reached it. It was fortunate; for, if\nthis refuge had failed, all chance of safety would have vanished, and\nthey must have perished in the waves. The water was up to the top of\nthe trunk where the main branches grew, so that it was easy to grasp\nthem. Thalcave, leaving his horse, and lifting Robert, seized the first limb,\nand soon his powerful arms had lodged the exhausted swimmers in a place\nof safety. But Thaouka, carried away by the current, was rapidly\ndisappearing. He turned his intelligent head towards his master, and,\nshaking his long mane, neighed for him beseechingly. [Illustration: A huge wave, forty feet high, overwhelmed the fugitives\nwith a terrible roar. Men and beasts, everything, disappeared in a\nwhirlpool of foam.

A few moments after, his arm\nrested upon the neck of Thaouka, and horse and horseman swam away\ntogether towards the misty horizon of the north. CHAPTER XXIII. A SINGULAR ABODE. The tree upon which Glenarvan and his companions had just found refuge\nresembled a walnut-tree. It had the same shining foliage and rounded\nform. It was the \"ombu,\" which is met with only on the Argentine\nPlains. It had an enormous, twisted trunk, and was confined to the\nearth not only by its great roots, but also by strong shoots which held\nit most tenaciously. It had thus resisted the force of the inundation. [Sidenote: AN ORNITHOLOGICAL OMNIUM-GATHERUM.] This ombu measured one hundred feet in height, and might have covered\nwith its shade a circumference of three hundred and sixty feet. All\nthe upper part rested on three great branches, which forked from the\ntop of the trunk, that was six feet in diameter. Two of these branches\nwere nearly perpendicular, and supported the immense canopy of foliage,\nwhose crossed, twisted, and interlaced limbs, as if woven by the hand\nof a basket-maker, formed an impenetrable shelter. The third branch,\non the contrary, extended almost horizontally over the roaring waters;\nits leaves were bathed in them, while it seemed a promontory to this\nisland of verdure surrounded by an ocean.", "similarity": 0.4129500985145569}]}

Truth\ncompels us to say that it was from the major, who now failed in his\nstrict habits of propriety. \"A fine geographer you are!\" said MacNabb, in a tone of badinage. \"But\nno matter, since we have succeeded.\" \"No matter?\" cried Paganel; \"I ought never to have forgotten that\ntwofold appellation!

Ah,\nit is beginning!\" [Sidenote: AN EXTRAORDINARY STORM.] Violent thunder-claps interrupted this conversation, and their\nintensity increased till they reached the most deafening peals. They soon became sonorous, and made the atmosphere vibrate in rapid\noscillations. The firmament was on fire, and during this commotion\nit was impossible to distinguish from what electric spark emanated\nthe indefinitely-prolonged rumblings that reverberated throughout the\nabysses of the sky. The incessant flashes assumed various forms. Some, darting\nperpendicularly towards the earth, were repeated five or six times in\nthe same place; others, separating into a thousand different branches,\nspread in zigzag lines and produced on the dark vault of the heavens\nastonishing jets of arborescent flame. Soon the sky, from east to\nnorth, was crossed by a phosphorescent band of intense brilliancy. This\nillumination gradually overspread the entire horizon, lighting up the\nclouds like a bonfire, and was reflected in the mirror-like waters,\nforming what seemed to be an immense circle of fire, of which the tree\noccupied the centre. Glenarvan and his companions watched this terrific spectacle in\nsilence. Sheets of dazzling light glided towards them, and blinding\nflashes followed in rapid succession, now showing the calm countenance\nof the major, then the speculative face of Paganel or the energetic\nfeatures of Glenarvan, and again the frightened look of Robert or the\nunconcerned expression of the sailors. The rain, however, did not fall\nas yet, nor had the wind risen. But soon the flood-gates of the heavens\nopened, and the rain came down in torrents, the drops, as they struck\nthe surface of the water, rebounding in thousands of sparks illuminated\nby the incessant lightning. Did this rain predict the end of the storm? Were Glenarvan and his\ncompanions to be released with a few thorough drenchings? At the height\nof this struggle of the elements, suddenly there appeared at the end\nof the branch which extended horizontally, a flaming globe, of the\nsize of a fist, and surrounded by a black smoke. This ball, after\nrevolving a few moments, burst like a bombshell, and with a noise that\nwas distinguishable in the midst of the general tumult. A sulphurous\nvapor filled the atmosphere. There was a moment of silence, and then\nTom Austin was heard crying,--\n\n\"The tree is on fire!\" He was right. In a moment the flame, as if it had been communicated\nto an immense piece of fireworks, spread along the west side of the\ntree. The dead limbs, the nests of dry grass, and finally the live wood\nitself, furnished material for the devouring element. The wind now rose and fanned the flames into fury.", "similarity": 0.3870629370212555}, {"chunk_id": 133, "text": "The boiler, which had burst at the shock, had thrown\nits iron plates to an enormous distance.

Glenarvan, Paganel, the major, and Captain Mangles mingled with the\ncrowd, and listened to the conjectures that passed from one to another. Each sought to explain the catastrophe, while laboring to save what was\nleft. \"The bridge has broken,\" said one. [Sidenote: CAUSES AND EFFECTS.] \"Broken?\" replied others. \"That cannot be, for it is still uninjured. They forgot to close it for the passage of the train, that is all.\" It was a draw-bridge, which had been constructed for the convenience of\nthe shipping. Had the man on guard, through unpardonable negligence,\nforgotten to close it, and thus precipitated the train, at full speed,\ninto the bed of the Lutton? This supposition seemed plausible, for one\nhalf of the bridge lay beneath the fragments of the cars, while the\nother still hung intact in its chains. Doubt was no longer possible;\nsurely carelessness must have caused the calamity. The accident had happened to the night express, which left Melbourne\nat forty-five minutes past eleven. It must have been a quarter-past\nthree in the morning when the train reached Camden Bridge, where this\nterrible destruction of life and property took place. The travelers\nand employés of the last car at once busied themselves in seeking\nassistance; but the telegraph-wires, whose poles lay on the ground,\nwere no longer available. It took the authorities of Castlemaine three\nhours to reach the scene of the disaster; and it was, therefore, six\no'clock in the morning before a corps of workers was organized under\nthe direction of the surveyor-general of the district, and a detachment\nof policemen, commanded by an officer. The squatters had come to their\naid, and exerted themselves to extinguish the fire, which consumed the\nheap of ruins with unconquerable fierceness. Several unrecognizable\nbodies lay on the edge of the embankment, but it was impossible\nto rescue a living being from this furnace. The fire had rapidly\naccomplished the work of destruction. Of the travelers in the train,\nwhose number was not known, only ten survived, those in the last car. The railroad company had just sent an extra locomotive to convey them\nto Castlemaine. Meantime, Lord Glenarvan, having made the acquaintance of the\nsurveyor-general, was conversing with him and the police-officer. The\nlatter was a tall, thin man, of imperturbable coolness, who, if he\nhad any feeling, betrayed no sign of it on his impassible features. He was like a mathematician engaged upon a problem; he was seeking to\nelucidate the mystery of the disaster. To Glenarvan's first words,\n\"This is a great calamity!\" he replied, calmly, \"It is more than that.\" \"More than that!\" cried Glenarvan; \"and what can be more than that?\" \"It is a crime!\" replied the officer, coolly. Glenarvan turned to Mr. Mitchell, the surveyor-general, with a\nquestioning look. \"That is correct,\" said the latter; \"our examination has convinced us\nthat the catastrophe is the result of a crime.

However, for that day at least the heavy\nclouds did not break; and at evening the horses, after traveling forty\nmiles, halted on the edge of a deep \"cañada,\" an immense natural ditch\nfilled with water. A shelter was wanting, but the ponchos served for\ntents as well as clothing, and peaceful slumbers enwrapped all. The next day, as they progressed farther, the presence of subterranean\nstreams betrayed itself more noticeably, and moisture was seen in every\ndepression of the ground. Soon they came to large ponds, some already\ndeep and others just forming. So long as there were only lagoons, the\nhorses could easily extricate themselves; but with these treacherous\nswamps it was more difficult. Tall grass obstructed them, and it was\nnecessary to incur the danger before it could be understood. These\nquagmires had been already fatal to more than one human being. Robert, who had ridden half a mile in advance, returned at a gallop,\ncrying,--\n\n\"Monsieur Paganel! Monsieur Paganel!

This\nis a strange country! People sow horns, and they spring up like corn! I\nshould like very well to have some of the seed.\" \"But he speaks seriously,\" said the major. \"Yes, major, you shall see.\" Robert was not mistaken, and soon they found themselves before a vast\nfield of horns, regularly planted. \"Well?\" said Robert. \"This is something singular,\" replied Paganel, turning towards the\nIndian with a questioning look. [Sidenote: AN ANXIOUS INDIAN.] \"The horns come from the ground,\" explained Thalcave; \"and the cattle\nare under it.\" \"What!\" cried Paganel, \"is there a whole drove in this mire?\" \"Yes,\" answered the Patagonian. In fact, a vast herd had perished in this bog, which had given way\nbeneath them. Hundreds of cattle had thus met their death, side by\nside, by suffocation in this vast quagmire. This circumstance, which\nsometimes takes place on the plains, could not be ignored by the\nIndian, and it was a warning which it was proper to heed. They passed\naround this immense hecatomb, which would have satisfied the most\nexacting gods of antiquity; and an hour after the field of horns was\nfar behind. Thalcave now began to observe with an anxious air the state of things\naround him. He frequently stopped, and rose in his stirrups. His tall\nform enabled him to survey a wide range; but, perceiving nothing that\ncould enlighten him, he resumed his undeviating course. A mile farther,\nhe stopped again, and, turning from the beaten track, proceeded a short\ndistance, first to the north, then to the south, and then resumed his\nplace at the head of the party, without saying either what he hoped or\nwhat he feared. These manoeuvres, many times repeated, puzzled Paganel and annoyed\nGlenarvan. The geographer was accordingly requested to interrogate\nthe Indian, which he did at once. Thalcave replied that he was\nastonished to see the plain so soaked with moisture. Never within his\nrecollection, since he had performed the office of guide, had his feet\ntrodden a soil so saturated.", "similarity": 0.34646740555763245}, {"chunk_id": 52, "text": "to start for India and arrive at Chili! to learn Spanish and speak Portuguese! this is too much, and, if it\ncontinues, I shall some day throw myself out of the window instead of\nmy cigar.\" To hear Paganel take his blunder thus, to see his comical actions, it\nwas impossible to keep serious. Besides, he set the example himself. \"Laugh, my friends,\" said he, \"laugh with a will! you cannot laugh as\nmuch as I do at myself.\" And he uttered the most formidable peal of laughter that ever issued\nfrom the mouth of a geographer. \"But we are none the less without an interpreter,\" said the major. \"Oh, do not be troubled,\" replied Paganel. \"The Portuguese and Spanish\nresemble each other so much that I made a mistake. However, this very\nresemblance will soon enable me to rectify my error, and in a short\ntime I will thank this worthy Patagonian in the language he speaks so\nwell.\" Paganel was right, for he could soon exchange a few words with the\nnative. He even learned that his name was Thalcave, a word which\nsignifies in Araucanian \"the thunderer.\" This surname was doubtless\ngiven to him for his skill in the use of fire-arms. [Sidenote: BETTER PROSPECTS.] But Glenarvan was particularly rejoiced to discover that the Patagonian\nwas a guide, and, moreover, a guide of the Pampas. There was,\ntherefore, something so providential in this meeting that the success\nof the enterprise seemed already an accomplished fact, and no one any\nlonger doubted the rescue of Captain Grant. In the meantime the travelers and the Patagonian had returned to\nRobert. The latter stretched his arms towards the native, who, without\na word, placed his hand upon his head. He examined the child and felt\nhis wounded limbs. Then, smiling, he went and gathered on the banks\nof the stream a few handfuls of wild celery, with which he rubbed the\nboy's body. Under this treatment, performed with an extreme gentleness,\nthe child felt his strength revive, and it was plain that a few hours\nwould suffice to restore him. It was therefore decided that that day and the following night should\nbe passed at the encampment. Besides, two important questions remained\nto be settled--food, and means of conveyance. Provisions and mules were\nboth wanting. Fortunately Thalcave solved the difficulty. This guide, who was\naccustomed to conduct travelers along the Patagonian frontiers, and\nwas one of the most intelligent baqueanos of the country, engaged to\nfurnish Glenarvan all that his little party needed. He offered to take\nhim to a \"tolderia\" (encampment) of Indians, about four miles distant,\nwhere they would find everything necessary for the expedition. This\nproposal was made partly by gestures, partly by Spanish words which\nPaganel succeeded in understanding. It was accepted, and Glenarvan and\nhis learned friend, taking leave of their companions, reascended the\nstream under the guidance of the Patagonian. They proceeded at a good pace for an hour and a half, taking long\nstrides to keep up to the giant Thalcave. All the region was charming,\nand of a rich fertility. The grassy pastures succeeded each other,\nand could easily have fed thousands of cattle. Large ponds, united by\na winding chain of streams, gave these plains a verdant moisture. Black-headed swans sported on the mirror-like surface, and disputed the\nempire of the waters with numberless ostriches that gamboled over the\nplains, while the brilliant feathered tribes were in wonderful variety.

To mistake the railroad was not so bad; to take\nthe train to Dumbarton, instead of Edinburgh, would do.

He kept repeating\nthose fatal words: \"The Duncan! the Duncan!\" He could find no others\nin his vocabulary. He went to and fro, examining the rigging of the\nyacht, and questioning the mute horizon of the open sea. At last he\nreturned to Lord Glenarvan.

The whole party, accordingly, entered the broad street of Seymour under\nthe guidance of Paganel, who always seemed to be perfectly acquainted\nwith what he had never seen. But his instinct directed him, and he went\nstraight to Campbell's North British Hotel. Horses and oxen were taken\nto the stable, the cart was put under the shed, and the travelers were\nconducted to quite comfortable apartments. At ten o'clock the guests took their seats at a table, over which\nOlbinett had cast his experienced eye. Paganel had just explored the\ntown, in company with Robert, and now related his nocturnal impressions\nin a very laconic style. He had seen absolutely nothing. However, a man less absent-minded would have observed a certain\nexcitement in the streets of Seymour. Groups were formed here and\nthere, which gradually increased. People talked at the doors of the\nhouses, and questioned each other with an air of anxiety. Various daily\npapers were read aloud, commented upon, and discussed. These signs,\none might suppose, could not have escaped the most careless observer;\nPaganel, however, had suspected nothing. The major, on the contrary, without even leaving the hotel, had\nascertained the fears that were agitating the little community. Ten\nminutes' conversation with the loquacious landlord had informed him;\nbut he did not utter a word. Not until supper was over, and Lady\nHelena, Mary, and Robert had retired to their chambers, did the major\nsay to his companions:\n\n\"They have traced the authors of the crime committed at Camden Bridge.\" \"Have they been arrested?\" asked Ayrton, quickly. \"No,\" replied MacNabb, without seeming to notice the eagerness of the\nquartermaster. \"So much the worse,\" added Ayrton. \"Well,\" inquired Glenarvan, \"to whom do they attribute the crime?\" \"Read,\" said the major, handing to Glenarvan a copy of the _Australian\nand New Zealand Gazette_, \"and you will see that the police-officer was\nnot mistaken.\" Glenarvan read aloud the following passage:\n\n\"Sydney, Jan. 2, 1865.--It will be remembered that on the night of\nDecember 29 an accident took place at Camden Bridge, five miles from\nCastlemaine Station, on the Melbourne and Sandhurst Railway, by which\nthe night express was precipitated at full speed into the Lutton River. Numerous thefts committed after the accident, and the corpse of the\nguard found half a mile above, prove that it was the result of a crime;\nand, in accordance with the verdict at the inquest, this crime is to\nbe attributed to a band of convicts who escaped, six months ago, from\nthe Perth penitentiary, in Western Australia, as they were about to\nbe transferred to Norfolk Island.

A year after his arrival\nin the country, Sergeant Manuel was naturalized, joined the Argentine\narmy, and married an honest Indian woman, who had twins,--boys, to be\nsure, for the sergeant's worthy consort would never present him with\ndaughters. Manuel did not think of any other calling than that of the\nsoldier, and hoped, in time, with the help of God, to offer to the\nrepublic a whole battalion of young soldiers. \"You have seen them?\" said he. \"Charming fellows! Good soldiers! José! Juan! Miguel! Pepe! Pepe is only seven years old, and is already biting\nhis cartridge!\" Pepe, hearing himself complimented, joined his two little feet, and\npresented arms with perfect precision. \"He will do!\" added the sergeant. \"He will be a major--or\nbrigadier-general one day!\" This story lasted a quarter of an hour, to Thalcave's great\nastonishment. The Indian could not understand how so many words could\ncome from a single throat. No one interrupted the commander; and even\na French sergeant had to conclude at last, though not without forcing\nhis guests to accompany him to his dwelling. Here they were introduced\nto Madame Ipharaguerre, who appeared to be \"a good-looking person,\" if\nthis expression may be employed in regard to an Indian. When he had exhausted himself, the sergeant asked his guests to what he\nowed the honor of their visit. And now it was their turn to explain. Paganel, opening the conversation in French, told him of their journey\nacross the Pampas, and ended by asking why the Indians had abandoned\nthe country. \"War!\" replied the sergeant. \"War?\" \"Yes, civil war.\" \"Civil war?\" rejoined Paganel. \"Yes, war between Paraguay and Buenos Ayres,\" answered the sergeant. \"Well?\" \"Why, all the Indians of the north are in the rear of General Flores,\nand those of the plains are plundering.\" \"But the caziques?\" \"The caziques with them.\" This answer was reported to Thalcave, who shook his head. Indeed,\nhe either did not know, or had forgotten, that a civil war, which\nwas afterwards to involve Brazil, was decimating two-thirds of the\nrepublic. The Indians had everything to gain in these internal\nstruggles, and could not neglect such fine opportunities for plunder. The sergeant, therefore, was not mistaken in attributing this desertion\nof the Pampas to the civil war that was being waged in the northern\npart of the Argentine Provinces. But this event disconcerted Glenarvan's hopes. If Captain Grant was\na prisoner of the caziques, he must have been carried by them to the\nnorthern frontiers. Yet how and where to find him? Must they attempt\na perilous and almost useless search to the northern limits of the\nPampas? It was a serious matter, which was to be earnestly considered. However, one important question was still to be asked of the sergeant,\nand the major thought of this, while his companions were looking at\neach other in silence. \"Have you heard of any Europeans being retained as prisoners by the\ncaziques of the Pampas?\" Manuel reflected for a few moments, like a man who recalls events to\nrecollection. \"Yes,\" said he, at length. \"Ah!\" cried Glenarvan, conceiving a new hope. [Sidenote: REVELATIONS.] Paganel, MacNabb, Robert, and he now surrounded the sergeant. \"Speak, speak!\" cried they, gazing at him with eagerness even in their\nlooks. \"Several years ago,\" replied Manuel, \"yes,--that is it,--European\nprisoners--but have never seen them.\" \"Several years ago?\" said Glenarvan. \"You are mistaken.

His eccentricities (and his abilities) made him much talked of in\nScotland. People seemed as though they could not show him enough\nattention. Just at this time an amiable lady of thirty, none other than the\nmajor's cousin, a little eccentric herself, but still agreeable and\ncharming, fell in love with the geographer's peculiarities. Paganel was\nfar from being insensible to Miss Arabella's attractions, yet did not\ndare to declare his sentiments. The major accordingly undertook the\npart of Cupid's messenger between these two congenial hearts, and even\ntold Paganel that marriage was \"the last blunder\" that he could commit. But the geographer was very much embarrassed, and, strangely enough,\ncould not summon courage to speak for himself. [Illustration: Early in the afternoon the travelers reached Malcolm\nCastle, amidst the hurrahs of their tenantry and friends.] \"Does not Miss Arabella please you?\" MacNabb would say to him. \"Oh, major, she is charming!\" cried Paganel,--\"a thousand times too\ncharming for me; and, if I must tell you, would please me better if she\nwere less so. I should like to find a defect.\" \"Be easy,\" answered the major; \"she has more than one. The most perfect\nwoman always has her share. Well, then, Paganel, are you decided?\" \"I do not dare.\" \"But, my learned friend, why do you hesitate?\" \"I am unworthy of her!\" was the geographer's invariable reply. At last, one day, driven desperate by the irrepressible major, Paganel\nconfessed to him, under the pledge of secrecy, a peculiarity that would\nfacilitate his identification, if the police should ever be on his\ntrack! \"Bah!\" exclaimed the major. \"It is as I tell you,\" persisted Paganel. \"What matter, my worthy friend?\" \"Is that your opinion?\" \"On the contrary, you are only more remarkable. This adds to your\npersonal advantages. It makes you the inimitable individual of whom\nArabella has dreamed.\" And the major, preserving an imperturbable gravity, left Paganel a prey\nto the most acute anxiety. A short interview took place between MacNabb and the lady, and fifteen\nweeks after a marriage was celebrated with great pomp in the chapel of\nMalcolm Castle. [Illustration: Fifteen weeks after a marriage was celebrated with great\npomp in the chapel of Malcolm Castle.] The geographer's secret would doubtless have remained forever\nburied in the abysses of the unknown if the major had not told it to\nGlenarvan, who did not conceal it from Lady Helena, who communicated\nit to Mrs. Mangles.

There were two men.\" \"No, three!\" said Glenarvan. \"Two,\" replied the sergeant, in a positive tone. \"Two?\" exclaimed Glenarvan, very much chagrined. \"Two Englishmen?\" \"No,\" continued the sergeant. \"Who speaks of Englishmen? It was a\nFrenchman and an Italian.\" \"An Italian who was massacred by the Indians?\" cried Paganel. \"Yes, and I learned afterwards--Frenchman saved.\" \"Saved!\" exclaimed Robert, whose very life seemed to hang on the\nsergeant's lips. \"Yes, saved from the hands of the Indians,\" replied Manuel. Each looked to the geographer, who beat his brow in despair. \"Ah! I understand,\" said he, at last. \"All is clear, all is explained.\" \"But what is to be done?\" asked Glenarvan, with as much anxiety as\nimpatience. \"My friends,\" answered Paganel, taking Robert's hands, \"we must submit\nto a severe misfortune.

The captive\nin question is not the captain, but one of my countrymen (whose\ncompanion, Marco Vazello, was actually assassinated by the Indians),\na Frenchman who often accompanied these cruel savages to the banks of\nthe Colorado, and who, after fortunately escaping from their hands,\nreturned to France. While thinking that we were on the track of Captain\nGrant, we have fallen upon that of young Guinnard.\" A profound silence followed this declaration. The mistake was palpable. The sergeant's story, the nationality of the prisoner, the murder\nof his companion, and his escape from the hands of the Indians, all\naccorded with the evident facts. Glenarvan gazed at Thalcave with a\nbewildered air. The Indian then resumed the conversation. \"Have you never heard of three English captives?\" he asked the sergeant. \"Never,\" replied Manuel. \"It would have been known at Tandil. I should\nhave heard of it. No, it cannot be.\" Glenarvan, after this formal response, had nothing more to do at Fort\nIndependence. He and his friends, therefore, departed, not without\nthanking the sergeant and shaking hands with him. Glenarvan was in despair at this complete overthrow of his hopes. Robert walked beside him in silence, with tearful eyes, while his\nprotector could not find a single word to console him. Paganel\ngesticulated and talked to himself. The major did not open his lips. As for Thalcave, his Indian pride seemed humbled at having gone astray\non a false trail. No one, however, thought of reproaching him for so\nexcusable an error. They returned to the encampment, saddened indeed. Still, not one of\nthe courageous and devoted men regretted so many hardships uselessly\nendured, so many dangers vainly incurred. But each saw all hope of\nsuccess annihilated in an instant. Could they find Captain Grant\nbetween Tandil and the sea? No. If any prisoner had fallen into the\nhands of the Indians on the Atlantic coast, Sergeant Manuel would\ncertainly have been informed. An event of such a nature could not\nhave escaped the natives who trade from Tandil to Carmen. Among the\ntraders of the Argentine Plains everything is known and reported.

Before Captain Mangles and the sailors recovered from the surprise into\nwhich this unexpected turn of affairs had thrown them, the audacious\nconvict had escaped, and joined his band, scattered along the edge of\nthe wood of gum-trees.

A few wreaths of white smoke were still\ncurling up between the branches of the gum-trees, but the tall tufts of\ngastrolobium were motionless and all signs of attack had disappeared.

But one serious fact appeared from this explanation. No one had yet\nthought of it; only Mary Grant, disregarding the past, looked forward\nto the future.

It is enough to know that\nI became chief of the runaways, under the name of Ben Joyce. In the\nmonth of September, 1864, I made my appearance at the Irishman's farm,\nand was received as a servant under my true name of Ayrton. Here I\nwaited till an opportunity should be offered to gain possession of a\nvessel. This was my great object. Two months later the Duncan arrived.

Then a conversation ensued. \"I have the letter,\" said one of them. \"Give it to me,\" replied Ben Joyce; \"and now the Duncan is ours!\" At this point in the story Glenarvan could not restrain a cry. MacNabb continued:\n\n[Sidenote: A HOPELESS CHANCE.] \"'Now, you others,' said Ben Joyce, 'catch the horse. In two days I\nshall be on board the Duncan, and in six at Twofold Bay. There is the\nplace of meeting. The lord's party will be still fast in the marshes\nof the Snowy. Cross the river at Kemple Pier bridge, go to the coast,\nand wait for me. I will find means to bring you on board. With the\ncrew once at sea, and a vessel like the Duncan, we shall be masters\nof the Indian Ocean.' 'Hurrah for Ben Joyce!' cried the convicts. Mulready's horse was then led up, and Ben Joyce disappeared at a gallop\non the Lucknow road, while the band proceeded southeastward to the\nSnowy River. Mulready, although severely wounded, had strength to drag\nhimself within two hundred paces of the encampment, where we picked him\nup almost dead. This,\" added MacNabb, \"is Mulready's sad story. You\nunderstand now why the courageous sailor wished so much to speak.\" This revelation terrified all. \"Pirates! pirates!\" cried Glenarvan. \"My crew massacred, my Duncan in\nthe hands of these bandits!\" \"Yes, for Ben Joyce will surprise the vessel,\" replied the major, \"and\nthen----\"\n\n\"Well, we must reach the coast before these wretches,\" said Paganel. \"But how cross the Snowy?\" asked Wilson. \"Like them,\" answered Glenarvan. \"They will cross Kemple Pier bridge,\nand we will do the same.\" \"But what will become of Mulready?\" inquired Lady Helena. \"We will take turns in carrying him. Shall I give up my defenceless\ncrew to Ben Joyce's band?\" The plan of crossing Kemple Pier bridge was practicable, but perilous. The convicts might locate themselves at this point to defend it. It\nwould be at least thirty against seven! But there are moments when we\ndo not think of these things, when we must advance at all hazards. \"My lord,\" said Captain Mangles, at length, \"before risking our\nlast chance, before venturing towards the bridge, it is prudent to\nreconnoitre it first. I will undertake this.\" \"I will accompany you, captain,\" replied Paganel. [Sidenote: THE BURNED BRIDGE.] This proposal was accepted, and the captain and Paganel prepared to\nstart immediately. They were to follow along the bank of the river till\nthey came to the place indicated by Ben Joyce, and keep out of sight\nof the convicts, who were probably lying in wait. These two courageous\nmen accordingly, well furnished with arms and provisions, set out, and\nsoon disappeared among the tall rushes of the river. [Illustration: The animal reared. Mulready seized his revolver and\nfired.] All day the little party waited for them. At evening they had not yet\nreturned, and great fears were entertained. At last, about eleven\no'clock, Wilson announced their approach. They arrived, worn out with\nthe fatigues of a six-mile journey. \"The bridge? Is it there?\" asked Glenarvan, rushing to meet them. \"Yes, a bridge of rushes,\" said Captain Mangles. \"The convicts passed,\nit is true, but----\"\n\n\"But what?\" cried Glenarvan, who foresaw a new calamity. \"They burned it after their passage,\" replied Paganel.

Let us have a talk; and tell me, are you satisfied with the\nScotia?\" \"What do you mean by the Scotia?\" asked the captain, at last. \"Why, the Scotia that carries us: a good ship, whose commander, the\nbrave Captain Burton, I have heard praised no less for his physical\nthan his moral qualities. Are you the father of the great African\ntraveler of that name?

But was he talking to a fool, or a rogue? This was a question in\nhis mind, and he was about to explain himself intelligibly, when Lord\nGlenarvan, his wife, and Miss Grant came on deck. The stranger perceived them, and cried,--\n\n\"Ah! passengers! passengers! excellent! I hope, Mr. Burdness, you are\ngoing to introduce me----\"\n\nAnd advancing with perfect ease, without waiting for the captain,--\n\n\"Madam\" said he to Miss Grant, \"Miss\" to Lady Helena, \"Sir\" he added,\naddressing Lord Glenarvan. \"Lord Glenarvan,\" said Captain Mangles. \"My lord,\" continued the unknown, \"I beg your pardon for introducing\nmyself, but at sea we must relax a little from etiquette. I hope we\nshall soon be acquainted, and that, in the society of these ladies, the\npassage of the Scotia will seem as short to us as agreeable.\" Lady Helena and Miss Grant could not find a word to answer. They were\ncompletely bewildered by the presence of this intruder. \"Sir,\" said Glenarvan, at length, \"whom have I the honor of addressing?\" \"Jacques Eliacim François Marie Paganel, secretary of the Geographical\nSociety of Paris; corresponding member of the societies of Berlin,\nBombay, Darmstadt, Leipsic, London, St. Petersburg, Vienna, and New\nYork; honorary member of the Royal Geographical and Ethnographical\nInstitute of the East Indies, who, after passing twenty years of his\nlife in studying geography, designs now to enter upon a roving life,\nand is directing his course to India to continue there the labors of\nthe great travelers.\" CHAPTER VII.

He ordered the mate of the Duncan to repair without delay to Twofold\nBay, and recommended the quartermaster to him as a man in whom he could\nplace entire confidence. As soon as he arrived at the bay, he was to\nsend a detachment of sailors under the command of Ayrton. He had just reached this part of his letter, when the major, who had\nbeen looking over his shoulder, asked him, in a singular tone, how he\nwrote the word Ayrton. \"As it is pronounced,\" replied Glenarvan. \"That is a mistake,\" said the major coolly. \"It is pronounced Ayrton,\nbut it is written 'Ben Joyce'!\" CHAPTER XLI. THE PLOT UNVEILED. The sound of the name of Ben Joyce fell upon the party like a\nthunderbolt. Ayrton suddenly sprang to his feet. In his hand was a\nrevolver. A report was heard; and Glenarvan fell, struck by a bullet. Before Captain Mangles and the sailors recovered from the surprise into\nwhich this unexpected turn of affairs had thrown them, the audacious\nconvict had escaped, and joined his band, scattered along the edge of\nthe wood of gum-trees. [Illustration: A report was heard; and Glenarvan fell, struck by a\nbullet.] The tent did not offer a sufficient shelter against the bullets, and\nit was clearly necessary to beat a retreat. Glenarvan, who was but\nslightly injured, had risen. \"To the cart! to the cart!\" cried Captain Mangles, as he hurried on\nLady Helena and Mary Grant, who were soon in safety behind its stout\nsides. The captain, the major, Paganel, and the sailors then seized their\nrifles, and stood ready to repel the convicts. Glenarvan and Robert had\njoined the ladies, while Olbinett hastened to the common defence. These events had transpired with the rapidity of lightning. Captain\nMangles attentively watched the edge of the wood; but the reports\nsuddenly ceased on the arrival of Ben Joyce, and a profound silence\nsucceeded the noisy fusillade. A few wreaths of white smoke were still\ncurling up between the branches of the gum-trees, but the tall tufts of\ngastrolobium were motionless and all signs of attack had disappeared. The major and Captain Mangles extended their examinations as far as the\ngreat trees. The place was abandoned. Numerous footprints were seen,\nand a few half-burnt cartridges smoked on the ground. The major, like\na prudent man, extinguished them, for a spark was enough to kindle a\nformidable conflagration in this forest of dry trees. \"The convicts have disappeared,\" said Captain Mangles. \"Yes,\" replied the major; \"and this disappearance alarms me. I should\nprefer to meet them face to face. It is better to encounter a tiger in\nthe open plain than a serpent in the grass. Let us search these bushes\naround the cart.\" [Sidenote: UNRAVELINGS.] The major and captain scoured the surrounding country. But from the\nedge of the wood to the banks of the Snowy they did not meet with a\nsingle convict. Ben Joyce's band seemed to have flown away, like a\nflock of mischievous birds. This disappearance was too strange to\ninspire a perfect security. They therefore resolved to keep on the\nwatch. The cart, which was a really immovable fortress, became the\ncentre of the encampment, and two men kept guard, relieving each other\nevery hour.

[Illustration: When he came to himself, he was in the hands of the\nnatives, who carried him into the interior of the country.] As for Captain Mangles, his doubts did not stand long before the\nassertions of the sailor, and he considered him a real companion of\nCaptain Grant when he heard him speak to the young girl of her father. Ayrton knew Mary and Robert perfectly. He had seen them at Glasgow\non the departure of the Britannia. He remembered that they had been\npresent at the farewell dinner given on board to the friends of the\ncaptain. Sheriff MacIntyre was one of the guests. Robert--scarcely\nten years old--had been confided to the care of Dick Turner, the\nboatswain, but had escaped from him and climbed to the top-sail\nyard-arm. [Illustration: At last, exhausted and almost dead, he reached the\nhospitable dwelling of Mr. O'Moore, where his labor insured him a\ncomfortable livelihood.] \"It is true! it is true!\" cried Robert. The quartermaster remembered, too, a thousand little circumstances\nto which he did not seem to attach so much importance as did Captain\nMangles. When he stopped, Mary said, in her sweet voice,--\n\n\"Mr. Ayrton, please tell us more about our father.\" Ayrton acceded to the young girl's request. Glenarvan was reluctant to\ninterrupt him, and yet many more important questions thronged his mind. But Lady Helena, pointing out to him Mary's joyful excitement, checked\nhis inquiries. [Sidenote: TWO YEARS OF SLAVERY.] The quartermaster now told the story of the Britannia and her voyage\nacross the Pacific. During the period of a year Harry Grant landed\nat the principal ports of Oceanica, opposing unjustifiable captures,\nand often a victim to the hostility of unjust traders. He found,\nhowever, an important point on the western coast of Papua. Here the\nestablishment of a Scottish colony appeared to him feasible, and its\nprosperity assured. After examining Papua, the Britannia sailed to\nCallao for provisions, and left that port on the 30th of May, 1862, to\nreturn to Europe by the way of the Indian Ocean and the Cape. Three\nweeks after her departure, a terrible tempest disabled her. It became\nnecessary to cut away the masts. A leak was discovered in the hold,\nwhich they did not succeed in stopping. The crew were soon overtasked\nand exhausted. The pumps could not be worked. For eight days the\nvessel was at the mercy of the storm. There were six feet of water\nin her hold, and she gradually foundered. The boats had been washed\noverboard, and the crew had given themselves up for lost, when on the\nnight of June 22nd, as Paganel had rightly interpreted, they descried\nthe eastern coast of Australia. The vessel soon stranded. A violent\nshock was felt. At this moment Ayrton, borne by a wave, was cast into\nthe midst of the breakers, and lost all consciousness. When he came to\nhimself, he was in the hands of the natives, who carried him into the\ninterior of the country. Since then he had heard nothing more of the\nBritannia, and naturally supposed that she had been wrecked, with all\non board, on the dangerous reefs of Twofold Bay. This was Ayrton's story, which elicited more than once exclamations of\nsympathy. The major could not justly doubt its correctness; and after\nthis recital the quartermaster's own experiences possessed a more real\ninterest. Indeed, thanks to the document, they no longer doubted that\nCaptain Grant had survived the shipwreck with two of his sailors.

But one serious fact appeared from this explanation. No one had yet\nthought of it; only Mary Grant, disregarding the past, looked forward\nto the future. Captain Mangles first saw her pale and disconsolate. He\nunderstood what was passing in her mind. \"Miss Mary!\" cried he, \"you are weeping!\" \"What is the matter, my child?\" asked Lady Helena. \"My father, madam, my father!\" replied the young girl.

He advised Glenarvan to form his party of\nthe best seamen of the Duncan.

The horses and cart were to be ready the next day, and the\ntravelers were to start at eight o'clock in the morning.

The young captain gave his last orders to Tom\nAustin, and instructed him above all to await the commands of Lord\nGlenarvan at Melbourne, and execute them scrupulously whatever they\nmight be. The trusty sailor replied that they might rely on him. In the\nname of the crew he offered to his lordship their best wishes for the\nsuccess of the expedition. The boat put off, and a thunder of applause\nrent the air. In a few moments the party reached the shore, and in no\ngreat length of time arrived at O'Moore's farm. Everything was ready. Lady Helena was delighted with her quarters. The\nimmense cart, with its rude wheels and massive timbers, especially\npleased her.

His past had\njust been reviewed by the major, and the wretch appeared as he was,--a\nbold and formidable criminal. His intentions had been clearly proved,\nand required, on the part of Glenarvan, extreme vigilance. Fortunately,\nthere was less to fear from the detected bandit than the secret traitor. But one serious fact appeared from this explanation. No one had yet\nthought of it; only Mary Grant, disregarding the past, looked forward\nto the future. Captain Mangles first saw her pale and disconsolate. He\nunderstood what was passing in her mind. \"Miss Mary!\" cried he, \"you are weeping!\" \"What is the matter, my child?\" asked Lady Helena. \"My father, madam, my father!\" replied the young girl. She could not continue. But a sudden revelation dawned on the mind of\neach. They comprehended Mary's grief, why the tears flowed from her\neyes, why the name of her father rose to her lips.

Meantime Glenarvan wrote the letter designed for Tom Austin. He ordered the mate of the Duncan to repair without delay to Twofold\nBay, and recommended the quartermaster to him as a man in whom he could\nplace entire confidence. As soon as he arrived at the bay, he was to\nsend a detachment of sailors under the command of Ayrton. He had just reached this part of his letter, when the major, who had\nbeen looking over his shoulder, asked him, in a singular tone, how he\nwrote the word Ayrton. \"As it is pronounced,\" replied Glenarvan. \"That is a mistake,\" said the major coolly. \"It is pronounced Ayrton,\nbut it is written 'Ben Joyce'!\" CHAPTER XLI. THE PLOT UNVEILED. The sound of the name of Ben Joyce fell upon the party like a\nthunderbolt. Ayrton suddenly sprang to his feet. In his hand was a\nrevolver. A report was heard; and Glenarvan fell, struck by a bullet. Before Captain Mangles and the sailors recovered from the surprise into\nwhich this unexpected turn of affairs had thrown them, the audacious\nconvict had escaped, and joined his band, scattered along the edge of\nthe wood of gum-trees. [Illustration: A report was heard; and Glenarvan fell, struck by a\nbullet.] The tent did not offer a sufficient shelter against the bullets, and\nit was clearly necessary to beat a retreat. Glenarvan, who was but\nslightly injured, had risen. \"To the cart! to the cart!\" cried Captain Mangles, as he hurried on\nLady Helena and Mary Grant, who were soon in safety behind its stout\nsides. The captain, the major, Paganel, and the sailors then seized their\nrifles, and stood ready to repel the convicts. Glenarvan and Robert had\njoined the ladies, while Olbinett hastened to the common defence. These events had transpired with the rapidity of lightning. Captain\nMangles attentively watched the edge of the wood; but the reports\nsuddenly ceased on the arrival of Ben Joyce, and a profound silence\nsucceeded the noisy fusillade. A few wreaths of white smoke were still\ncurling up between the branches of the gum-trees, but the tall tufts of\ngastrolobium were motionless and all signs of attack had disappeared. The major and Captain Mangles extended their examinations as far as the\ngreat trees. The place was abandoned. Numerous footprints were seen,\nand a few half-burnt cartridges smoked on the ground. The major, like\na prudent man, extinguished them, for a spark was enough to kindle a\nformidable conflagration in this forest of dry trees. \"The convicts have disappeared,\" said Captain Mangles. \"Yes,\" replied the major; \"and this disappearance alarms me. I should\nprefer to meet them face to face. It is better to encounter a tiger in\nthe open plain than a serpent in the grass. Let us search these bushes\naround the cart.\" [Sidenote: UNRAVELINGS.] The major and captain scoured the surrounding country. But from the\nedge of the wood to the banks of the Snowy they did not meet with a\nsingle convict. Ben Joyce's band seemed to have flown away, like a\nflock of mischievous birds. This disappearance was too strange to\ninspire a perfect security. They therefore resolved to keep on the\nwatch. The cart, which was a really immovable fortress, became the\ncentre of the encampment, and two men kept guard, relieving each other\nevery hour.

However it may be, Captain Grant did not hesitate to land\nme, April 8, 1862, on the west coast of Australia.\" \"Australia!\" exclaimed the major, interrupting Ayrton's story. \"Then\nyou left the Britannia before her arrival at Callao, where the last\nnews of her was dated?\" \"Yes,\" replied the quartermaster; \"for the Britannia never stopped at\nCallao while I was on board. If I spoke of Callao at O'Moore's farm, it\nwas your story that gave me this information.\" \"Go on, Ayrton,\" said Glenarvan. [Sidenote: MORE BLANKS THAN PRIZES.] \"I found myself, therefore, abandoned on an almost desert coast, but\nonly twenty miles from the penitentiary of Perth, the capital of\nWestern Australia. Wandering along the shore, I met a band of convicts\nwho had just escaped. I joined them. You will spare me, my lord, the\naccount of my life for two years and a half. It is enough to know that\nI became chief of the runaways, under the name of Ben Joyce. In the\nmonth of September, 1864, I made my appearance at the Irishman's farm,\nand was received as a servant under my true name of Ayrton. Here I\nwaited till an opportunity should be offered to gain possession of a\nvessel. This was my great object. Two months later the Duncan arrived. During your visit at the farm you related, my lord, the whole story of\nCaptain Grant. I then learned what I had not known, the Britannia's\nstoppage at Callao, the last news of her, dated June, 1862, two months\nafter my abandonment, the finding of the document, the shipwreck of the\nvessel, and finally the important reasons you had for seeking Captain\nGrant in Australia. I did not hesitate, but resolved to appropriate\nthe Duncan,--a marvelous ship, that would have distanced the best of\nthe British navy. However, there were serious injuries to be repaired. I therefore let her start for Melbourne, and offered myself to you in\nmy real character of quartermaster, volunteering to guide you to the\nscene of the shipwreck, which I falsely located on the eastern coast\nof Australia. Thus followed at a distance and sometimes preceded by\nmy band of convicts, I conducted your party across the province of\nVictoria. My companions committed a useless crime at Camden Bridge,\nsince the Duncan, once at Twofold Bay, could not have escaped me, and\nwith it I should have been master of the ocean. I brought you thus\nunsuspectingly as far as the Snowy River. The horses and oxen fell dead\none by one, poisoned by the gastrolobium. I entangled the cart in the\nmarshes. At my suggestion----but you know the rest, my lord, and can\nbe certain that, except for Mr. Paganel's absent-mindedness, I should\nnow be commander on board the Duncan. Such is my story, gentlemen. My\ndisclosures, unfortunately, cannot set you on the track of Captain\nGrant, and you see that in dealing with me you have made a bad bargain.\" The quartermaster ceased, crossed his arms, according to his custom,\nand waited. Glenarvan and his friends were silent. They felt that this\nstrange criminal had told the entire truth. The capture of the Duncan\nhad only failed through a cause altogether beyond his control. His\naccomplices had reached Twofold Bay, as the convict's blouse, found by\nGlenarvan, proved.", "similarity": 0.4841387867927551}, {"chunk_id": 122, "text": "These\ncourageous searchers were no longer to wander on blindly. Harry Grant,\nthey believed, had found a refuge on the continent, and each heart\nwas full of the satisfaction that certainty brings when it takes the\nplace of doubt. In two months, perhaps, the Duncan would land the lost\ncaptain on the shores of Scotland. When Captain Mangles seconded the proposal that they should attempt to\ncross Australia with the ladies, he supposed that this time he would\naccompany the expedition. He therefore consulted Glenarvan on the\nsubject, and brought forward various arguments in his own favor, such\nas his desire to take part in the search for his countryman, and his\nusefulness in the undertaking. \"One question, John,\" said Glenarvan. \"You have absolute confidence in\nyour mate?\" \"Absolute,\" replied he. \"Tom Austin is a good sailor. He will take the\nDuncan to Melbourne, repair her thoroughly, and bring her back at the\nappointed time. He is a man devoted to duty and discipline, and will\nnever take the responsibility of changing or delaying the execution of\nan order. You can rely upon him as fully as on myself.\" \"Very well, captain,\" replied Glenarvan; \"you shall accompany us; for,\"\nadded he, smiling, \"you certainly ought to be present when we find Mary\nGrant's father.\" \"Ah, my lord!\" murmured Captain Mangles, with something like a blush\nupon his swarthy cheeks. [Sidenote: A PALACE-CART.] The next day the captain, accompanied by the carpenter and by the\nsailors loaded with provisions, returned to the farm of Mr. O'Moore,\nwho was to assist him in the preparations. All the family were waiting\nfor him, ready to work under his orders. Ayrton was there, and freely\ngave them the benefit of his experience. He and his employer were\nagreed on this point, that the ladies ought to make the journey in an\nox-cart, and the gentlemen on horseback. The colonist could procure\nthem the animals and vehicle. The vehicle was a cart twenty feet long and covered with an awning,\nthe whole resting upon four wheels, without spokes, felloes, or tires. The front wheels were a long way from the hind ones, and were joined\ntogether by a rude contrivance that made it impossible to turn short. To the body of the cart was attached a pole thirty-five feet long, to\nwhich three pairs of oxen were coupled. The animals, thus arranged,\ndrew by means of a yoke across their necks, to which the bow was\nfastened with an iron pin. It required great skill to manage this long,\nnarrow, tottering vehicle, and guide the oxen by means of the whip. But Ayrton had served his apprenticeship at O'Moore's farm, and his\nemployer guaranteed his dexterity. Upon him, therefore, devolved the\nduty of driving. The cart, being without springs, was not very easy; but our travelers\nwere obliged to conform to circumstances as much as they could. As no\nchange was possible in its rude construction, Captain Mangles arranged\nthe interior in the most comfortable manner. He divided it into two\ncompartments by a wooden partition. The rear one was designed for\nthe provisions, the baggage, and Mr. Olbinett's portable kitchen,\nwhile the forward one was reserved exclusively for the ladies. The\ncarpenter converted it into a convenient chamber, covered it with a\nthick carpet, and furnished it with a dressing-table and two berths for\nLady Helena and Mary Grant.

Moreover,\non leaving Melbourne, I kept my destination secret, and the crew did\nnot know it till we were out at sea and the shores of Australia had\ndisappeared from sight. But then an incident occurred that perplexed me\nvery much.\" \"What do you mean, Tom?\" inquired Glenarvan. \"I mean,\" he replied, \"that when the quartermaster, Ayrton, learned,\nthe day after our departure, the Duncan's destination----\"\n\n\"Ayrton!\" cried Glenarvan. \"Is he on board?\" \"Yes, my lord.\" \"Ayrton here!\" repeated Glenarvan, glancing at Captain Mangles. \"Wonderful indeed!\" said the young captain. In an instant, with the swiftness of lightning, Ayrton's conduct, his\nlong-contrived treachery, Glenarvan's wound, the attack upon Mulready,\ntheir sufferings in the marshes of the Snowy, all the wretch's deeds,\nflashed upon the minds of the two men. And now, by a strange fatality,\nthe convict was in their power. \"Where is he?\" asked Glenarvan quickly. \"In a cabin in the forecastle,\" replied Tom Austin, \"closely guarded.\" \"Why this confinement?\" [Sidenote: AN UNOFFICIAL TRIBUNAL.] \"Because, when Ayrton saw that the yacht was sailing for New Zealand,\nhe flew into a passion; because he attempted to force me to change the\nship's course; because he threatened me; and, finally, because he urged\nmy men to a mutiny. I saw that he was a dangerous person, and was\ncompelled, therefore, to take precautions against him.\" \"And since that time?\" \"Since that time he has been in his cabin, without offering to come\nout.\" \"Good!\" At this moment Glenarvan and Captain Mangles were summoned to the\nsaloon. Breakfast, which they so much needed, was ready. They took\nseats at the table, but did not speak of Ayrton. However, when the meal was ended, and the passengers had assembled on\ndeck, Glenarvan informed them of the quartermaster's presence on board. At the same time he declared his intention of sending for him. \"Can I be released from attending this tribunal?\" asked Lady Helena. \"I confess to you, my dear Edward, that the sight of this unfortunate\nwould be very painful to me.\" \"It is only to confront him, Helena,\" replied Glenarvan. \"Remain,\nif you can. Ben Joyce should see himself face to face with all his\nintended victims.\" Lady Helena yielded to this request, and Mary Grant and she took their\nplaces beside him, while around them stood the major, Paganel, Captain\nMangles, Robert, Wilson, Mulready, and Olbinett, all who had suffered\nso severely by the convict's treason. The crew of the yacht, who did\nnot yet understand the seriousness of these proceedings, maintained a\nprofound silence. \"Call Ayrton!\" said Glenarvan. CHAPTER LVI. AYRTON'S OBSTINACY. Ayrton soon made his appearance. He crossed the deck with a confident\nstep, and ascended the poop-stairs. His eyes had a sullen look, his\nteeth were set, and his fists clinched convulsively. His bearing\ndisplayed neither exultation nor humility. As soon as he was in Lord\nGlenarvan's presence, he folded his arms, and calmly and silently\nwaited to be questioned:\n\n\"Ayrton,\" said Glenarvan, \"here we all are, as you see, on board the\nDuncan, that you would have surrendered to Ben Joyce's accomplices.\" At these words the lips of the quartermaster slightly trembled.", "similarity": 0.432443767786026}]}

As for the learned geographer, he was probably the happiest man in the\nsouthern hemisphere. He passed his time in studying the maps with which\nhe covered the cabin-table; and then followed daily discussions with\nMr. Olbinett, so that he could scarcely set the table. But Paganel had all the passengers on his side except the major,\nwho was very indifferent to geographical questions, especially at\ndinner-time. Having discovered a whole cargo of odd books in the mate's\nchests, and among them a number of Cervantes' works, the Frenchman\nresolved to learn Spanish, which nobody on board knew, and which would\nfacilitate his search on the shores of Chili. Thanks to his love for\nphilology, he did not despair of speaking this new tongue fluently on\narriving at Concepcion. He therefore studied assiduously, and was heard\nincessantly muttering heterogeneous syllables. During his leisure hours\nhe did not fail to give young Robert practical instruction, and taught\nhim the history of the country they were rapidly approaching. In the meantime the Duncan was proceeding at a remarkable rate. She\ncut the Tropic of Capricorn, and her prow was headed toward the strait\nof the celebrated geographer. Now and then the low shores of Patagonia\nwere seen, but like an almost invisible line on the horizon. They\nsailed along the coast for more than ten miles, but Paganel's famous\ntelescope gave him only a vague idea of these American shores. The vessel soon found herself at the head of the strait, and entered\nwithout hesitation. This way is generally preferred by steam-vessels\nbound for the Pacific. Its exact length is three hundred and\nseventy-six miles. Ships of the greatest tonnage can always find deep\nwater, even near its shores, an excellent bottom, and many springs of\nwater.

At one moment the Duncan rounded the peninsula of Brunswick between\ntwo magnificent sights. Just here the strait cuts between stupendous\nmasses of granite.

Paganel also told, at great length, the tales of many of the sad\nincidents which from time to time have marked even the commercial\nintercourse between the European and the Maori; as, for instance, the\nsad tale of conflict and bloodshed connected with the death of Captain\nMarion, a French navigator, in 1772. He had landed near the spot where\nSurville had ill-treated some of the natives and traitorously seized\na son of the chief, Takouri, who yet appeared to welcome this next\nFrench visitant, though remembering none the less the terrible duty of\nvengeance which is felt by the Maori to be so binding. [Illustration: It was on the sixth of October, 1769, that this\nnavigator (Captain Cook) first landed on the shores.] For a long time the cloak of friendship was worn by the natives, the\nmore thoroughly to lull the suspicions of the whites, and to entice a\nlarger number on shore; in which endeavor they succeeded only too well. The French ships being greatly out of repair, Marion was induced to\nfell timber at some distance in the interior, and to establish in this\noccupation a great number of his men, going frequently to them, and\nremaining with them and the apparently friendly chiefs. On one of these\noccasions the Maoris fulfilled their revengeful project with a terrible\nsatisfaction to themselves. Only one man, of all those in the interior,\nmanaged to escape, the commander himself falling a prey to their\nvengeance. They then endeavored to kill the second in command, who,\nwith several others, was nearer to the shore. These, of course, at once\nstarted for their boats; breathless, they reached them, hotly pursued\nto the water's edge by the insatiate savages. Then, safe themselves,\nthe French marksmen picked off the chief, and the previous exultation\nof the aborigines was, even in the hour of their triumph, turned to\nlamentation, coupled with wonder at the terrible power of the white\nman's fire-barrel.

Six days after her\ndeparture, the Macquarie had not descried the shores of Auckland.

Manuel did not think of any other calling than that of the\nsoldier, and hoped, in time, with the help of God, to offer to the\nrepublic a whole battalion of young soldiers. \"You have seen them?\" said he. \"Charming fellows! Good soldiers! José! Juan! Miguel! Pepe! Pepe is only seven years old, and is already biting\nhis cartridge!\" Pepe, hearing himself complimented, joined his two little feet, and\npresented arms with perfect precision. \"He will do!\" added the sergeant. \"He will be a major--or\nbrigadier-general one day!\" This story lasted a quarter of an hour, to Thalcave's great\nastonishment. The Indian could not understand how so many words could\ncome from a single throat. No one interrupted the commander; and even\na French sergeant had to conclude at last, though not without forcing\nhis guests to accompany him to his dwelling. Here they were introduced\nto Madame Ipharaguerre, who appeared to be \"a good-looking person,\" if\nthis expression may be employed in regard to an Indian. When he had exhausted himself, the sergeant asked his guests to what he\nowed the honor of their visit. And now it was their turn to explain.

Indeed,\nhe either did not know, or had forgotten, that a civil war, which\nwas afterwards to involve Brazil, was decimating two-thirds of the\nrepublic. The Indians had everything to gain in these internal\nstruggles, and could not neglect such fine opportunities for plunder. The sergeant, therefore, was not mistaken in attributing this desertion\nof the Pampas to the civil war that was being waged in the northern\npart of the Argentine Provinces. But this event disconcerted Glenarvan's hopes. If Captain Grant was\na prisoner of the caziques, he must have been carried by them to the\nnorthern frontiers. Yet how and where to find him? Must they attempt\na perilous and almost useless search to the northern limits of the\nPampas? It was a serious matter, which was to be earnestly considered. However, one important question was still to be asked of the sergeant,\nand the major thought of this, while his companions were looking at\neach other in silence. \"Have you heard of any Europeans being retained as prisoners by the\ncaziques of the Pampas?\" Manuel reflected for a few moments, like a man who recalls events to\nrecollection. \"Yes,\" said he, at length. \"Ah!\" cried Glenarvan, conceiving a new hope.

While thinking that we were on the track of Captain\nGrant, we have fallen upon that of young Guinnard.\" A profound silence followed this declaration. The mistake was palpable. The sergeant's story, the nationality of the prisoner, the murder\nof his companion, and his escape from the hands of the Indians, all\naccorded with the evident facts. Glenarvan gazed at Thalcave with a\nbewildered air. The Indian then resumed the conversation. \"Have you never heard of three English captives?\" he asked the sergeant. \"Never,\" replied Manuel. \"It would have been known at Tandil. I should\nhave heard of it. No, it cannot be.\" Glenarvan, after this formal response, had nothing more to do at Fort\nIndependence. He and his friends, therefore, departed, not without\nthanking the sergeant and shaking hands with him. Glenarvan was in despair at this complete overthrow of his hopes. Robert walked beside him in silence, with tearful eyes, while his\nprotector could not find a single word to console him. Paganel\ngesticulated and talked to himself. The major did not open his lips. As for Thalcave, his Indian pride seemed humbled at having gone astray\non a false trail. No one, however, thought of reproaching him for so\nexcusable an error. They returned to the encampment, saddened indeed. Still, not one of\nthe courageous and devoted men regretted so many hardships uselessly\nendured, so many dangers vainly incurred. But each saw all hope of\nsuccess annihilated in an instant. Could they find Captain Grant\nbetween Tandil and the sea? No. If any prisoner had fallen into the\nhands of the Indians on the Atlantic coast, Sergeant Manuel would\ncertainly have been informed. An event of such a nature could not\nhave escaped the natives who trade from Tandil to Carmen. Among the\ntraders of the Argentine Plains everything is known and reported. There\nwas therefore but one course now to take,--to join, without delay, the\nDuncan at Cape Medano, the appointed rendezvous.

A year after his arrival\nin the country, Sergeant Manuel was naturalized, joined the Argentine\narmy, and married an honest Indian woman, who had twins,--boys, to be\nsure, for the sergeant's worthy consort would never present him with\ndaughters. Manuel did not think of any other calling than that of the\nsoldier, and hoped, in time, with the help of God, to offer to the\nrepublic a whole battalion of young soldiers. \"You have seen them?\" said he. \"Charming fellows! Good soldiers! José! Juan! Miguel! Pepe! Pepe is only seven years old, and is already biting\nhis cartridge!\" Pepe, hearing himself complimented, joined his two little feet, and\npresented arms with perfect precision. \"He will do!\" added the sergeant. \"He will be a major--or\nbrigadier-general one day!\" This story lasted a quarter of an hour, to Thalcave's great\nastonishment. The Indian could not understand how so many words could\ncome from a single throat. No one interrupted the commander; and even\na French sergeant had to conclude at last, though not without forcing\nhis guests to accompany him to his dwelling. Here they were introduced\nto Madame Ipharaguerre, who appeared to be \"a good-looking person,\" if\nthis expression may be employed in regard to an Indian. When he had exhausted himself, the sergeant asked his guests to what he\nowed the honor of their visit. And now it was their turn to explain. Paganel, opening the conversation in French, told him of their journey\nacross the Pampas, and ended by asking why the Indians had abandoned\nthe country. \"War!\" replied the sergeant. \"War?\" \"Yes, civil war.\" \"Civil war?\" rejoined Paganel. \"Yes, war between Paraguay and Buenos Ayres,\" answered the sergeant. \"Well?\" \"Why, all the Indians of the north are in the rear of General Flores,\nand those of the plains are plundering.\" \"But the caziques?\" \"The caziques with them.\" This answer was reported to Thalcave, who shook his head. Indeed,\nhe either did not know, or had forgotten, that a civil war, which\nwas afterwards to involve Brazil, was decimating two-thirds of the\nrepublic. The Indians had everything to gain in these internal\nstruggles, and could not neglect such fine opportunities for plunder. The sergeant, therefore, was not mistaken in attributing this desertion\nof the Pampas to the civil war that was being waged in the northern\npart of the Argentine Provinces. But this event disconcerted Glenarvan's hopes. If Captain Grant was\na prisoner of the caziques, he must have been carried by them to the\nnorthern frontiers. Yet how and where to find him? Must they attempt\na perilous and almost useless search to the northern limits of the\nPampas? It was a serious matter, which was to be earnestly considered. However, one important question was still to be asked of the sergeant,\nand the major thought of this, while his companions were looking at\neach other in silence. \"Have you heard of any Europeans being retained as prisoners by the\ncaziques of the Pampas?\" Manuel reflected for a few moments, like a man who recalls events to\nrecollection. \"Yes,\" said he, at length. \"Ah!\" cried Glenarvan, conceiving a new hope. [Sidenote: REVELATIONS.] Paganel, MacNabb, Robert, and he now surrounded the sergeant. \"Speak, speak!\" cried they, gazing at him with eagerness even in their\nlooks. \"Several years ago,\" replied Manuel, \"yes,--that is it,--European\nprisoners--but have never seen them.\" \"Several years ago?\" said Glenarvan. \"You are mistaken.

He looked first at Lord\nGlenarvan, always serious; then at Lady Helena and Miss Grant, whose\nfeatures expressed a sympathetic disappointment; and finally at Captain\nMangles, who was smiling, and the imperturbable major. Then, raising\nhis shoulders and drawing down his glasses from his forehead to his\neyes, he exclaimed,--\n\n\"What a joke!\" But at that his eyes fell upon the steering wheel, on which were\ninscribed these two words, thus:\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"The Duncan! the Duncan!\" he cried in a tone of real despair; and,\nleaping down the companion-way, he rushed to his cabin. When the unfortunate geographer had disappeared, no one on board,\nexcept the major, could retain gravity, and the laugh was communicated\neven to the sailors. To mistake the railroad was not so bad; to take\nthe train to Dumbarton, instead of Edinburgh, would do. But to mistake\nthe vessel, and be sailing to Chili, when he wished to go to India, was\nthe height of absent-mindedness. [Sidenote: ABSENT-MINDEDNESS.] \"On the whole, I am not astonished at this on the part of Jacques\nPaganel,\" said Glenarvan; \"he is noted for such blunders. He once\npublished a celebrated map of America, in which he located Japan. However, he is a distinguished scholar, and one of the best geographers\nof France.\" [Illustration]\n\n\"But what are we going to do with the poor gentleman?\" asked Lady\nHelena. \"We cannot take him to Patagonia.\" \"Why not?\" replied MacNabb gravely. \"We are not responsible for his\nerrors. Suppose he were in a railroad car, would it stop for him?\" \"No; but he could get out at the first station,\" answered Lady Helena. \"Well,\" said Glenarvan, \"he can do so now, if he pleases, at our first\nlanding.\" At this moment Paganel, woeful and humble, reappeared on deck, after\nconvincing himself that his baggage was on board. He kept repeating\nthose fatal words: \"The Duncan! the Duncan!\" He could find no others\nin his vocabulary. He went to and fro, examining the rigging of the\nyacht, and questioning the mute horizon of the open sea. At last he\nreturned to Lord Glenarvan. [Illustration]\n\n\"And this Duncan is going----?\" he asked. \"To America, Monsieur Paganel.\" \"And where especially?\" \"To Concepcion.\" \"To Chili! to Chili!\" cried the unfortunate geographer. \"And my mission\nto India! But what will M. de Quatrefages say, the President of the\nCentral Commission? How shall I represent myself at the sessions of the\nSociety?\" [Sidenote: COURTESY AND CONVERSE.] \"Come, monsieur,\" said Glenarvan, \"do not despair. Everything can\nbe arranged, and you will only have to submit to a delay of little\nconsequence. The Yaroo-tsang-bo-tsoo will wait for you in the mountains\nof Thibet.

But we can say this is an\nextraordinary adventure, which would not have happened but for me. And\nmy cabin which is engaged on board the Scotia?\" \"Oh, as for the Scotia, I advise you to give her up for the present.\" \"But,\" said Paganel after examining the vessel again, \"the Duncan is a\npleasure yacht.\" \"Yes, sir,\" replied Captain Mangles, \"and belongs to his lordship, Lord\nGlenarvan----\"\n\n\"Who begs you to make free use of his hospitality,\" said Glenarvan. \"A thousand thanks, my lord,\" replied Paganel; \"I am truly sensible\nto your courtesy.

The Patagonian did not reply. \"Do--you--understand?\" cried Paganel, violently enough to damage his\norgans of speech. It was evident that the Indian did not understand, for he answered, but\nin Spanish,--\n\n\"I do not understand.\" It was Paganel's turn now to be astonished, and he hastily put on his\nglasses, like one irritated. \"May I be hanged,\" said he, \"if I understand a word of this infernal\njargon! It is certainly Araucanian.\" \"No,\" replied Glenarvan; \"this man answered in Spanish.\" And, turning to the Patagonian, he repeated,--\n\n\"Spanish?\" \"Yes,\" replied the native. Paganel's surprise became amazement. The major and Glenarvan looked at\nhim quizzingly. \"Ah, my learned friend!\" said the major, while a half smile played\nabout his lips, \"you have committed one of those blunders peculiar to\nyou.\" \"What!\" cried the geographer, starting. \"Yes, it is plain that this Patagonian speaks Spanish.\" \"He?\" [Illustration: A man of lofty stature was standing, motionless, on\none of the first ledges of the mountain. This individual had broad\nshoulders, and long hair tied with leathern thongs.] [Sidenote: A PENINSULAR BABEL.] \"Yes. By mistake you have learnt another language, while thinking that\nyou studied----\"\n\nMacNabb did not finish. A loud \"Oh!\" from the geographer, accompanied\nby shrugs of the shoulders, cut him short. \"Major, you are going a little too far,\" said Paganel in a very dry\ntone. \"To be sure, since you do not understand.\" \"I do not understand because this native speaks so badly!\" answered the\ngeographer, who began to be impatient. \"That is to say, he speaks badly, because you do not understand,\"\nreturned the major, calmly. \"MacNabb,\" said Glenarvan, \"that is not a probable supposition. However\nabstracted our friend Paganel may be, we cannot suppose that his\nblunder was to learn one language for another.\" \"Now, my dear Edward, or rather you, my good Paganel, explain to me\nwhat the difficulty is.\" \"I will not explain,\" replied Paganel, \"I insist. Here is the book\nin which I practice daily the difficulties of the Spanish language! Examine it, major, and you will see whether I impose upon you.\" So saying, Paganel groped in his numerous pockets. After searching a\nfew moments, he drew forth a volume in a very bad state, and presented\nit with an air of assurance. The major took the book, and looked at it. \"Well, what work is this?\" he asked. \"The Lusiad,\" replied Paganel; \"an admirable poem which----\"\n\n\"The Lusiad!\" cried Glenarvan. \"Yes, my friend, the Lusiad of the immortal Camoëns, nothing more or\nless.\" \"Camoëns!\" repeated Glenarvan; \"but, unfortunate friend, Camoëns was\na Portuguese! It is Portuguese that you have been studying for six\nweeks.\" \"Camoëns! Lusiad! Portuguese!\" Paganel could say no more. His eyes wandered, while a peal of Homeric\nlaughter rang in his ears. The Patagonian did not wink; he waited patiently for the explanation of\nthis event, which was totally incomprehensible to him. \"Insensate! fool!\" cried Paganel, at last. \"What! is it so? Is it not\na mere joke? Have I done this? It is the confusion of languages, as at\nBabel.

Paganel also told, at great length, the tales of many of the sad\nincidents which from time to time have marked even the commercial\nintercourse between the European and the Maori; as, for instance, the\nsad tale of conflict and bloodshed connected with the death of Captain\nMarion, a French navigator, in 1772. He had landed near the spot where\nSurville had ill-treated some of the natives and traitorously seized\na son of the chief, Takouri, who yet appeared to welcome this next\nFrench visitant, though remembering none the less the terrible duty of\nvengeance which is felt by the Maori to be so binding. [Illustration: It was on the sixth of October, 1769, that this\nnavigator (Captain Cook) first landed on the shores.] For a long time the cloak of friendship was worn by the natives, the\nmore thoroughly to lull the suspicions of the whites, and to entice a\nlarger number on shore; in which endeavor they succeeded only too well. The French ships being greatly out of repair, Marion was induced to\nfell timber at some distance in the interior, and to establish in this\noccupation a great number of his men, going frequently to them, and\nremaining with them and the apparently friendly chiefs. On one of these\noccasions the Maoris fulfilled their revengeful project with a terrible\nsatisfaction to themselves. Only one man, of all those in the interior,\nmanaged to escape, the commander himself falling a prey to their\nvengeance. They then endeavored to kill the second in command, who,\nwith several others, was nearer to the shore. These, of course, at once\nstarted for their boats; breathless, they reached them, hotly pursued\nto the water's edge by the insatiate savages. Then, safe themselves,\nthe French marksmen picked off the chief, and the previous exultation\nof the aborigines was, even in the hour of their triumph, turned to\nlamentation, coupled with wonder at the terrible power of the white\nman's fire-barrel.

The sea was rough, the\nrigging creaked, the ribs cracked, and the vessel rode the waves with\ndifficulty. Fortunately, Will Halley, like a man who was in no hurry, did not crowd\non sail, or his masts would inevitably have snapped. Captain Mangles\nhoped, therefore, that this clumsy craft would reach its destination\nin safety; still, he was pained to see his companions on board in such\nmiserable quarters.

As for the learned geographer, he was probably the happiest man in the\nsouthern hemisphere. He passed his time in studying the maps with which\nhe covered the cabin-table; and then followed daily discussions with\nMr. Olbinett, so that he could scarcely set the table.

Having discovered a whole cargo of odd books in the mate's\nchests, and among them a number of Cervantes' works, the Frenchman\nresolved to learn Spanish, which nobody on board knew, and which would\nfacilitate his search on the shores of Chili. Thanks to his love for\nphilology, he did not despair of speaking this new tongue fluently on\narriving at Concepcion. He therefore studied assiduously, and was heard\nincessantly muttering heterogeneous syllables. During his leisure hours\nhe did not fail to give young Robert practical instruction, and taught\nhim the history of the country they were rapidly approaching.

The worthy geographer almost fell backwards. \"A rough little\ngentleman,\" said he; \"I will teach him geography.\" As Captain Mangles\nhad engaged to make him a sailor, Glenarvan a man of honor, the major a\nboy of coolness, Lady Helena a noble and generous being, and Mary Grant\na pupil grateful towards such patrons, Robert was evidently to become\none day an accomplished gentleman. The Duncan soon finished shipping her coal, and then leaving these\ngloomy regions she gained the current from the southeast coast of\nBrazil, and, after crossing the equator with a fine breeze from the\nnorth, she entered the southern hemisphere. The passage was effected\nwithout difficulty, and every one had good hopes. On this voyage in\nsearch of Captain Grant, the probabilities increased every day. Their\ncaptain was one of the most confident on board; but his confidence\nproceeded especially from the desire that he cherished so strongly at\nheart, of seeing Miss Mary happy and consoled. He was particularly\ninterested in this young girl; and this feeling he concealed so well,\nthat, except Miss Grant and himself, no one on board the Duncan had\nperceived it.", "similarity": 0.5585254430770874}, {"chunk_id": 24, "text": "\"This vessel is not the Scotia.\" Paganel's amazement cannot be depicted. He looked first at Lord\nGlenarvan, always serious; then at Lady Helena and Miss Grant, whose\nfeatures expressed a sympathetic disappointment; and finally at Captain\nMangles, who was smiling, and the imperturbable major. Then, raising\nhis shoulders and drawing down his glasses from his forehead to his\neyes, he exclaimed,--\n\n\"What a joke!\" But at that his eyes fell upon the steering wheel, on which were\ninscribed these two words, thus:\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"The Duncan! the Duncan!\" he cried in a tone of real despair; and,\nleaping down the companion-way, he rushed to his cabin. When the unfortunate geographer had disappeared, no one on board,\nexcept the major, could retain gravity, and the laugh was communicated\neven to the sailors. To mistake the railroad was not so bad; to take\nthe train to Dumbarton, instead of Edinburgh, would do. But to mistake\nthe vessel, and be sailing to Chili, when he wished to go to India, was\nthe height of absent-mindedness. [Sidenote: ABSENT-MINDEDNESS.] \"On the whole, I am not astonished at this on the part of Jacques\nPaganel,\" said Glenarvan; \"he is noted for such blunders. He once\npublished a celebrated map of America, in which he located Japan. However, he is a distinguished scholar, and one of the best geographers\nof France.\" [Illustration]\n\n\"But what are we going to do with the poor gentleman?\" asked Lady\nHelena. \"We cannot take him to Patagonia.\" \"Why not?\" replied MacNabb gravely. \"We are not responsible for his\nerrors. Suppose he were in a railroad car, would it stop for him?\" \"No; but he could get out at the first station,\" answered Lady Helena. \"Well,\" said Glenarvan, \"he can do so now, if he pleases, at our first\nlanding.\" At this moment Paganel, woeful and humble, reappeared on deck, after\nconvincing himself that his baggage was on board. He kept repeating\nthose fatal words: \"The Duncan! the Duncan!\" He could find no others\nin his vocabulary. He went to and fro, examining the rigging of the\nyacht, and questioning the mute horizon of the open sea. At last he\nreturned to Lord Glenarvan. [Illustration]\n\n\"And this Duncan is going----?\" he asked. \"To America, Monsieur Paganel.\" \"And where especially?\" \"To Concepcion.\" \"To Chili! to Chili!\" cried the unfortunate geographer. \"And my mission\nto India! But what will M. de Quatrefages say, the President of the\nCentral Commission? How shall I represent myself at the sessions of the\nSociety?\" [Sidenote: COURTESY AND CONVERSE.] \"Come, monsieur,\" said Glenarvan, \"do not despair. Everything can\nbe arranged, and you will only have to submit to a delay of little\nconsequence. The Yaroo-tsang-bo-tsoo will wait for you in the mountains\nof Thibet. We shall soon reach Madeira, and there you will find a\nvessel to take you back to Europe.\" \"I thank you, my lord, and must be resigned. But we can say this is an\nextraordinary adventure, which would not have happened but for me. And\nmy cabin which is engaged on board the Scotia?\" \"Oh, as for the Scotia, I advise you to give her up for the present.\" \"But,\" said Paganel after examining the vessel again, \"the Duncan is a\npleasure yacht.\" \"Yes, sir,\" replied Captain Mangles, \"and belongs to his lordship, Lord\nGlenarvan----\"\n\n\"Who begs you to make free use of his hospitality,\" said Glenarvan. \"A thousand thanks, my lord,\" replied Paganel; \"I am truly sensible\nto your courtesy. But permit me to make a simple remark. India is a\nbeautiful country. It offers marvelous surprises to travelers.", "similarity": 0.5530737638473511}]}

The same evening, when the\nflock was safe at the farm, the little Luigi hastened to the smith at\nPalestrina, took a large nail, heated and sharpened it, and formed a\nsort of stylus. The next morning he gathered an armful of pieces of\nslate and began. At the end of three months he had learned to write.

It would require years to do again what I have done\nhere, and the results would be instantly destroyed if our jailers knew\nwe had communicated with each other. Besides, be assured, my dear\nEdmond, the dungeon I am about to leave will not long remain empty;\nsome other unfortunate being will soon take my place, and to him you\nwill appear like an angel of salvation.

At length Providence\nhas done something for you; he restores to you more than he takes away,\nand it was time I should die.”\n\nEdmond could only clasp his hands and exclaim, “Oh, my friend, my\nfriend, speak not thus!” and then resuming all his presence of mind,\nwhich had for a moment staggered under this blow, and his strength,\nwhich had failed at the words of the old man, he said, “Oh, I have\nsaved you once, and I will save you a second time!” And raising the\nfoot of the bed, he drew out the phial, still a third filled with the\nred liquor. “See,” he exclaimed, “there remains still some of the magic draught.

His protruding and deeply furrowed\nbrow, his fierce look and his sinister countenance, showed him to be a\nformidable individual. He was a Maori chief of high rank, as could be seen by the delicate\nand compact tattooing that striped his face and body.

The sharp albatross bone, used\nby Maori tattooers, had furrowed his face five times, in close and\ndeep lines. That he had reached his fifth promotion was evident from\nhis haughty bearing. A large flaxen mat, ornamented with dog-skins,\nenveloped his person; while a girdle, bloody with his recent conflicts,\nencircled his waist. From his ears dangled ear-rings of green jade, and\naround his neck hung necklaces of \"pounamous,\" sacred stones to which\nthe New Zealanders attribute miraculous properties.

The\nspectacles and telescope gave him a high opinion of Paganel, whom he\nattached carefully to his person, not only by his benefits, but by\nstrong flaxen ropes, especially at night. This novel situation lasted three long days. Was he well or badly\ntreated? Both, as he stated without further explanation. In short, he\nwas a prisoner, and, except for the prospect of immediate torture,\nhis condition did not seem more enviable than that of his unfortunate\nfriends. Fortunately, last night he succeeded in biting asunder his ropes and\nescaping. He had witnessed at a distance the burial of the chief,\nknew that he had been interred on the summit of Maunganamu mountain,\nand that it was tabooed in consequence. He therefore resolved to take\nrefuge there, not wishing to leave the place where his companions were\nheld captives. He succeeded in his undertaking, arrived at Kara-Tété's\ntomb, and waited in hope that Providence would in some way deliver his\nfriends. Such was Paganel's story. Did he omit designedly any circumstance\nof his stay among the natives? More than once his embarrassment led\nthem to suspect so. However that might be, he received unanimous\ncongratulations; and as the past was now known, they returned to the\npresent. Their situation was still exceedingly critical. The natives, if they\ndid not venture to climb the mountain, expected that hunger and thirst\nwould force their prisoners to surrender. It was only a matter of time,\nand the savages had great patience. Glenarvan did not disregard the\ndifficulties of his position, but waited for the favorable issue which\nProvidence seemed to promise. And first he wished to examine this improvised fortress; not to defend\nit, for an attack was not to be feared, but that he might find a way of\nescaping. The major and the captain, Robert, Paganel, and himself, took\nthe exact bearings of the mountain. They observed the direction of the\npaths, their branches and declivities. A ridge a mile in length united\nthe Maunganamu to the Wahiti range, and then declined to the plain. Its\nnarrow and winding summit presented the only practicable route, in case\nescape should become possible. If the fugitives could pass this point\nunperceived, under cover of the night, perhaps they might succeed in\nreaching the deep valleys and outwitting the Maoris. But this course offered more than one danger, as they would have to\npass below within gun-shot. The bullets of the natives on the lower\nramparts of the pah might intercept them, and form a barrier that no\none could safely cross. Glenarvan and his friends, as soon as they ventured on the dangerous\npart of the ridge, were saluted with a volley of shots; but only a\nfew wads, borne by the wind, reached them. They were made of printed\npaper. Paganel picked them up out of curiosity, but it was difficult to\ndecipher them.

Scarcely had Paganel looked at it when he exclaimed,--\n\n\"It is a guanaco!\" \"What is that?\" asked Glenarvan. \"An animal that eats itself.\" \"And is it good?\" [Sidenote: \"A DISH FOR THE GODS.\"] \"Delicious! a dish for the gods!

A Frenchman is always a cook.\" In a little while Paganel placed large slices of meat on the coals,\nand, in a short time, served up to his companions this appetizing\nviand. No one hesitated, but each attacked it ravenously. To the great\namazement of the geographer, a general grimace accompanied by a \"pwah!\" followed the first mouthful. \"It is horrible!\" said one. \"It is not eatable!\" replied another. The poor geographer, whatever was the difficulty, was forced to agree\nthat this steak was not acceptable even to starving men. They therefore\nbegan to launch jokes at him, and deride his \"dish for the gods,\" while\nhe himself sought a reason for this unaccountable result. \"I have it!\" he cried. \"I have it!\" \"Is the meat too old?\" asked MacNabb, calmly. \"No, my intolerant major; but it has traveled too much. How could I\nforget that?\" \"What do you mean?\" asked Tom Austin. \"I mean that the animal is not good unless killed when at rest. I\ncan affirm from the taste that it has come from a distance, and,\nconsequently, the whole herd.\" \"You are certain of this?\" said Glenarvan. \"Absolutely so.\" \"But what event could have terrified these animals so, and driven them\nat a time when they ought to be peacefully sleeping in their lairs.\" \"As to that, my dear Glenarvan,\" said Paganel, \"it is impossible for me\nto say.

Let us retire, major!\" \"Very well, Paganel.\" Thereupon each wrapped himself in his poncho, the fuel was replenished\nfor the night, and soon all but Glenarvan were buried in profound\nrepose. He alone did not sleep. A secret uneasiness held him in a state of\nwakeful fatigue. He could not help thinking of that herd, flying in one\ncommon direction, of their inexplicable terror. They could not have\nbeen pursued by wild beasts: at that height there were scarcely any,\nand yet fewer hunters. What fright had driven them over the abysses\nof Antuco, and what was the cause of it? He thought of their strange\nsituation, and felt a presentiment of coming danger. However, under the influence of a partial drowsiness, his ideas\ngradually modified, and fear gave place to hope. He saw himself in\nanticipation, on the morrow, on the plain at the foot of the Andes. There his actual search was to begin; and success was not, perhaps, far\ndistant.

The glowing fragments fell into the rushing waters\nand floated away in the current, sending forth flashes of ruddy light. The flames at one moment would rise to a fearful height, to be lost\nin the aerial conflagration, and the next, beaten back by the furious\nhurricane, would envelop the tree like a robe of molten gold. Glenarvan, Robert, the major, Paganel, and the sailors, were terrified. A thick smoke was stifling them; an intolerable heat was scorching\nthem. The fire was extending to the lower part of the tree on their\nside; nothing could stop or extinguish it; and they felt themselves\nirrevocably doomed to the torture of those victims who are confined\nwithin the burning sides of a sacrificial fire-basket. At last their situation was no longer tenable, and of two deaths they\nwere forced to choose the least cruel. \"To the water!\" cried Glenarvan.

Vague words, lamentations, and broken phrases, in which she celebrated\nthe virtues of the dead, interrupted her groans; and, in a final\nparoxysm of grief, she stretched herself at the foot of the mound,\nbeating the ground with her head.

At one moment the crew thought the yacht would\nnot rise again. Already the sailors, hatchet in hand, were rushing\nto cut away the fore-shrouds, when they were violently torn from\ntheir fastenings by the blast. The ship righted herself, but, without\nsupport on the waves, she was tossed about so terribly that the masts\nthreatened to break at their very foundations. She could not long\nendure such rolling; she was growing weak, and soon her shattered sides\nand opening seams must give way for the water.

He succeeded\nafter several hours' labor, but it was not until three o'clock in the\nafternoon that the jib was hauled to the main-stay and set to the\nwind. With this piece of canvas the Duncan flew before the wind\nwith inconceivable rapidity. It was necessary to keep up the greatest\npossible speed, for upon this alone depended her safety. Sometimes,\noutstripping the waves, she cut them with her slender prow and plunged\nbeneath them, like an enormous sea-monster, while the water swept\nher deck from stem to stern. At other times her swiftness barely\nequaled that of the surges, her rudder lost all power, and she gave\nterrific lurches that threatened to capsize her. Then, impelled by the\nhurricane, the billows outran her; they leaped over the taffrail, and\nthe whole deck was swept with tremendous violence. The situation was indeed alarming. The captain would not leave his\npost for an instant. He was tortured by fears that his impassive face\nwould not betray, and persistently sought to penetrate with his gaze\nthe gathering gloom. And he had good cause for fear. The Duncan, driven\nout of her course, was running towards the Australian coast with a\nswiftness that nothing could arrest. He felt, too, as if by instinct,\nthat a strong current was drawing him along.

His protruding and deeply furrowed\nbrow, his fierce look and his sinister countenance, showed him to be a\nformidable individual. He was a Maori chief of high rank, as could be seen by the delicate\nand compact tattooing that striped his face and body. Two black\nspirals, starting from the nostrils of his aquiline nose, circled his\ntawny eyes, met on his forehead, and were lost in his abundant hair. His mouth, with its shining teeth, and his chin, were hidden beneath\na net-work of varied colors, while graceful lines wound down to his\nsinewy breast. There was no doubt as to his rank. The sharp albatross bone, used\nby Maori tattooers, had furrowed his face five times, in close and\ndeep lines. That he had reached his fifth promotion was evident from\nhis haughty bearing. A large flaxen mat, ornamented with dog-skins,\nenveloped his person; while a girdle, bloody with his recent conflicts,\nencircled his waist. From his ears dangled ear-rings of green jade, and\naround his neck hung necklaces of \"pounamous,\" sacred stones to which\nthe New Zealanders attribute miraculous properties. At his side lay a\ngun of English manufacture, and a \"patou-patou,\" a kind of double-edged\nhatchet. Near him nine warriors, of lower rank, armed and of ferocious aspect,\nsome still suffering from recent wounds, stood in perfect immobility,\nenveloped in their flaxen mantles.

They were not long in learning, by the aid of a few English words which\nthe natives used, that, being driven back by the British troops, they\nwere returning, vanquished and weakened, to the regions of the upper\nWaikato. Their chief, after an obstinate resistance, in which he lost\nhis principal warriors, was now on his way to rouse again the river\ntribes. He was called Kai-Koumou, a terrible name, which signified\nin the native language \"he who eats the limbs of his enemy.\" He was\nbrave and bold, but his cruelty equaled his bravery. No pity could be\nexpected from him. His name was well known to the English soldiers, and\na price had been set upon his head by the governor of New Zealand.

Glenarvan, pushing back MacNabb,\nwas advancing along the path, when, not far from the cart, these words\nwere uttered:\n\n\"Help! help!\" It was a plaintive and despairing voice. Captain Mangles and the major\nrushed towards it. In a few moments they perceived, on the edge of\nthe coppice, a human form that was dragging itself along and groaning\npiteously. It was Mulready, wounded and half dead. When his companions\nraised him, they felt their hands dabbling in blood. The rain now\nincreased, and the wind howled through the branches of the dead trees. In the midst of these terrific gusts, Glenarvan, the major, and the\ncaptain bore the body of Mulready. On arriving at the cart, Paganel, Robert, Wilson, and Olbinett came\nout, and Lady Helena gave up her room to the poor sailor. The major\ntook off Mulready's vest, wet with blood and rain. He discovered the\nwound. It was a poniard stab, which the unfortunate had received in his\nright side. MacNabb dressed it skillfully. Whether the weapon had reached the vital\nparts, he could not say. A stream of bright-red blood spurted forth,\nwhile the paleness and the swoon of the wounded man proved that he had\nbeen seriously injured. The major accordingly placed upon the opening\nof the wound, after first washing it with fresh water, a thick wad of\ntinder, and then a few layers of lint, confined by a bandage, and thus\nsucceeded in stopping the hemorrhage. The patient was then laid on his\nside, his head and breast raised, and Lady Helena gave him a refreshing\ndraught. At the end of a quarter of an hour, the wounded man, who had been\nmotionless till then, made a movement. His eyes half opened, his lips\nmurmured disconnected words, and the major, putting down his ear, heard\nhim say:\n\n\"My lord--the letter--Ben Joyce----\"\n\n[Sidenote: A DAY OF DOUBT.] The major repeated these words, and glanced at his companions. What did\nMulready mean? Ben Joyce had attacked the sailor, but why? Was it not\nsimply for the purpose of preventing him from reaching the Duncan?

A burning fever consumed him. Lady Helena\nand Mary Grant, as though his sisters, did not leave him; never was\npatient better nursed, or by more tender hands. Day appeared. The rain had ceased. Heavy clouds still rolled along\nthe vault of the sky, and the earth was strewn with the fragments of\nbranches. The clay, soaked by floods of water, had yielded; and the\nsides of the cart became unsteady, but sank no deeper. Captain Mangles, Paganel, and Glenarvan took a tour of exploration\naround the camp. They traversed the path still marked with blood, but\nfound no trace of Ben Joyce or his band. They went to the place where\nthe attack had been made. Here two corpses lay on the ground, shot\nby Mulready. One was the farrier of Black Point. His face, which had\nmortified, was a horrible sight.

Here I\nwaited till an opportunity should be offered to gain possession of a\nvessel. This was my great object. Two months later the Duncan arrived. During your visit at the farm you related, my lord, the whole story of\nCaptain Grant. I then learned what I had not known, the Britannia's\nstoppage at Callao, the last news of her, dated June, 1862, two months\nafter my abandonment, the finding of the document, the shipwreck of the\nvessel, and finally the important reasons you had for seeking Captain\nGrant in Australia.

As soon as he arrived at the bay, he was to\nsend a detachment of sailors under the command of Ayrton. He had just reached this part of his letter, when the major, who had\nbeen looking over his shoulder, asked him, in a singular tone, how he\nwrote the word Ayrton. \"As it is pronounced,\" replied Glenarvan. \"That is a mistake,\" said the major coolly. \"It is pronounced Ayrton,\nbut it is written 'Ben Joyce'!\" CHAPTER XLI. THE PLOT UNVEILED. The sound of the name of Ben Joyce fell upon the party like a\nthunderbolt. Ayrton suddenly sprang to his feet. In his hand was a\nrevolver. A report was heard; and Glenarvan fell, struck by a bullet. Before Captain Mangles and the sailors recovered from the surprise into\nwhich this unexpected turn of affairs had thrown them, the audacious\nconvict had escaped, and joined his band, scattered along the edge of\nthe wood of gum-trees.

A year after his arrival\nin the country, Sergeant Manuel was naturalized, joined the Argentine\narmy, and married an honest Indian woman, who had twins,--boys, to be\nsure, for the sergeant's worthy consort would never present him with\ndaughters. Manuel did not think of any other calling than that of the\nsoldier, and hoped, in time, with the help of God, to offer to the\nrepublic a whole battalion of young soldiers. \"You have seen them?\" said he. \"Charming fellows! Good soldiers! José! Juan! Miguel! Pepe! Pepe is only seven years old, and is already biting\nhis cartridge!\" Pepe, hearing himself complimented, joined his two little feet, and\npresented arms with perfect precision. \"He will do!\" added the sergeant. \"He will be a major--or\nbrigadier-general one day!\" This story lasted a quarter of an hour, to Thalcave's great\nastonishment. The Indian could not understand how so many words could\ncome from a single throat. No one interrupted the commander; and even\na French sergeant had to conclude at last, though not without forcing\nhis guests to accompany him to his dwelling. Here they were introduced\nto Madame Ipharaguerre, who appeared to be \"a good-looking person,\" if\nthis expression may be employed in regard to an Indian. When he had exhausted himself, the sergeant asked his guests to what he\nowed the honor of their visit. And now it was their turn to explain. Paganel, opening the conversation in French, told him of their journey\nacross the Pampas, and ended by asking why the Indians had abandoned\nthe country. \"War!\" replied the sergeant. \"War?\" \"Yes, civil war.\" \"Civil war?\" rejoined Paganel. \"Yes, war between Paraguay and Buenos Ayres,\" answered the sergeant. \"Well?\" \"Why, all the Indians of the north are in the rear of General Flores,\nand those of the plains are plundering.\" \"But the caziques?\" \"The caziques with them.\" This answer was reported to Thalcave, who shook his head. Indeed,\nhe either did not know, or had forgotten, that a civil war, which\nwas afterwards to involve Brazil, was decimating two-thirds of the\nrepublic. The Indians had everything to gain in these internal\nstruggles, and could not neglect such fine opportunities for plunder. The sergeant, therefore, was not mistaken in attributing this desertion\nof the Pampas to the civil war that was being waged in the northern\npart of the Argentine Provinces. But this event disconcerted Glenarvan's hopes. If Captain Grant was\na prisoner of the caziques, he must have been carried by them to the\nnorthern frontiers. Yet how and where to find him? Must they attempt\na perilous and almost useless search to the northern limits of the\nPampas? It was a serious matter, which was to be earnestly considered. However, one important question was still to be asked of the sergeant,\nand the major thought of this, while his companions were looking at\neach other in silence. \"Have you heard of any Europeans being retained as prisoners by the\ncaziques of the Pampas?\" Manuel reflected for a few moments, like a man who recalls events to\nrecollection. \"Yes,\" said he, at length. \"Ah!\" cried Glenarvan, conceiving a new hope.

However, he did not breathe a word of his personal suspicions,\nbut contented himself with exploring the surroundings of the river,\nwhose tranquillity was undisturbed. As for Glenarvan, his only fear was\nto see Ayrton return alone. In the absence of skilled labor, the cart\ncould not resume its journey, which would be interrupted for several\ndays perhaps; and his longings for success and eagerness to attain his\nend admitted of no delay. Fortunately, Ayrton had lost neither his time nor his trouble. The\nnext morning he reappeared at break of day. A man accompanied him, by\nprofession a farrier. He was a tall, stout fellow, but of a low and\nbrutish appearance, which did not prepossess one in his favor. However,\nthis was of little importance, if he knew his business. At all events\nhis breath was not wasted in idle words. \"Is he an efficient workman?\" inquired Captain Mangles of the\nquartermaster. \"I know no more than you, captain,\" replied Ayrton. \"We shall see.\" The farrier began his work. He was a man who understood his trade, as\none could see by the way in which he repaired the wheels of the cart. He labored skillfully and with uncommon energy. During the operation, the major noticed that the farrier's wrists were\nconsiderably eroded, and that they were each encircled by a blackish\nring of extravasated blood. These were the marks of recent wounds,\nwhich the sleeves of a miserable woolen shirt but partially concealed. MacNabb questioned the man about these erosions, which must have been\nvery painful. He, however, made no reply, but stolidly kept on at his\nwork. Two hours after, the injuries of the cart were repaired. As for\nGlenarvan's horse, he was quickly shod. The farrier had taken care to\nbring shoes all prepared. There was a peculiarity about them, however,\nwhich did not escape the major. It was a trefoil rudely carved on the\nouter rim. He pointed it out to Ayrton. \"It is the Black Point mark,\" replied the quartermaster, \"which enables\nthem to follow the tracks of the horses that stray from the station,\nand not confound them with others.\" The farrier, having done all that was required of him, now claimed his\nwages, and departed without having spoken four words. Half an hour later, the travelers were on the move. Beyond the curtain\nof mimosas extended a broad, uncovered space, which justly deserved its\nname of \"open plain.\" Fragments of quartz and ferruginous rocks lay\namong the bushes, tall grass, and hedgerows that protected numerous\nflocks.", "similarity": 0.37701454758644104}]}

FRESH FACES. They had not proceeded far before they reached a native cemetery,\npleasantly situated and with abundance of shady trees. Here for a\ntime they halted, and, whilst Robert and Paganel were exploring, Lord\nand Lady Glenarvan almost stumbled over a queer object. It was human,\nindigenous, and sleeping; but at first this was all that they could\ndecide, until, as the eyes opened and the sleeper roused to active\nlife, they saw before them a boy of eight years, with a notice pinned\nto the back of his jacket which read as follows: \"TOLINÉ*, to be\nconducted to Echuca, care of Jeff Smith, Railway Porter. Prepaid.\" [Illustration: A boy of eight years, with a notice pinned to the back\nof his jacket which read as follows: \"Toliné, to be conducted to\nEchuca, care of Jeff Smith, Railway Porter.

He\nhad been educated in the Wesleyan Methodist day-school at Melbourne,\nand was now going for a time to visit his parents, who were living\nwith the rest of their tribe in Lachlan. He had been in the train to\nwhich the accident had happened, and had, with childlike confidence,\ntroubled less about his fate than did those of older years. Going to a\nlittle distance, and laying himself on the grass, he had soon fallen\ninto the slumber from which our travelers had aroused him. [Illustration: Paganel and the others had now gathered round, and\nToliné had to answer many a question. He came out of his examination\nvery creditably.] Paganel and the others had now gathered round, and Toliné had to answer\nmany a question. He came out of his examination very creditably; the\nreverence with which he spoke of the Creator and of the Bible produced\na very favorable impression on the Scottish heads of the expedition,\nwhilst the fact that he had taken \"the first prize in geography\" was\nsufficient introduction to Monsieur Paganel, who forthwith tested his\nknowledge, greatly to his own satisfaction, and considerably to the\ncredit of his young pupil. The curiosity of his discoverers having been\nfully satisfied, Toliné was made welcome, and partook with the others\nof the general repast. Many were the plans and purposes concerning\nhim, and much wonder was expressed as to how they could speed him on\nhis way; but in the morning it was discovered that he had solved the\nproblem for himself, and a bouquet of fresh leaves and flowers, laid by\nthe side of Lady Helena's seat, was the only memento that Toliné had\nleft. [Sidenote: A GOLDEN CITY.] The party were now approaching the district which, in the years 1851\nand 1852, was so much talked of throughout the civilized world,\nand attracted from all parts so many reckless adventurers and\nfortune-hunters.", "similarity": 0.3747384250164032}, {"chunk_id": 151, "text": "Ayrton\nwould doubtless have been eventually nonplused had they not, after an\nhour's climbing, caught sight of a tavern on one of the paths of the\nmountain. \"Well!\" said Paganel, as they reached the hostelry, \"the proprietor of\nthis inn cannot make a great fortune in such a place. Of what use can\nhe be?\" \"To give us the information we need for our journey,\" replied\nGlenarvan. \"Let us go in.\" Glenarvan, followed by Ayrton, entered the tavern. The landlord of\n\"Bush Inn\" was a coarse man, of forbidding appearance, who had to\nconsider himself as the principal customer for the gin, brandy, and\nwhisky of his tavern, and scarcely ever saw any one but squatters or\nherdsmen. He replied in an ill-humored way to the questions that were addressed\nhim; but his answers sufficed to determine Ayrton upon his course. Glenarvan, however, remunerated the tavern-keeper for the little\ntrouble they had given him, and was about to leave the inn, when a\nplacard, affixed to the wall, attracted his attention. It was a notice\nof the colonial police, detailing the escape of the convicts from\nPerth, and setting a price upon the head of Ben Joyce--a hundred pounds\nsterling to any one who should deliver him up. \"Indeed,\" said Glenarvan, \"that is a rascal worth hanging.\" \"And especially worth taking,\" replied Ayrton. \"A hundred pounds! What\na sum! He is not worth it.\" \"As for the inn-keeper,\" added Glenarvan, as he left the room, \"I\nscarcely put faith in him, despite his placard.\" \"Nor I either,\" said Ayrton. Glenarvan and the quartermaster rejoined the party, and they all\nproceeded to where a narrow pass wound across the chain. Here they\nbegan the ascent. [Sidenote: ANOTHER DEATH.] But it was an arduous task. More than once the ladies and their\ncompanions had to dismount, and it was often necessary to push the\nwheels of the heavy vehicle at some steep ascent, or to hold it\nback along the edge of some dangerous precipice. The oxen, as they\ncould not work to advantage at sudden turns, had frequently to be\nunyoked, and the cart blocked to prevent it from sliding back. Ayrton\nwas repeatedly forced to bring the already exhausted horses to his\nassistance. Whether this exertion was too prolonged, or whether from some other\ncause, one of the horses gave out during the ascent. He fell suddenly,\nwithout an instant's warning. It was Mulready's horse; and when the\nsailor attempted to help him up, he found that he was dead. Ayrton\nexamined the animal carefully, but did not seem to understand the cause\nof this sudden death. \"The beast must have burst a blood-vessel,\" said Glenarvan. \"Evidently,\" replied Ayrton. \"Take my horse, Mulready,\" added Glenarvan; \"I will join Lady Helena in\nthe cart.\" Mulready obeyed, and the little party continued their fatiguing ascent,\nabandoning the body to the crows. The next day they began the descent, which was much more rapid. During\nits course a violent hail-storm burst on them, and they were forced to\nseek a shelter beneath the rocks. Not hailstones, but pieces of ice as\nlarge as one's hand, were precipitated from the angry clouds. A sling\ncould not have hurled them with greater force, and several sharp blows\nwarned Paganel and Robert to be on their guard.

However, in fancy\nthey still conversed, questioned, and answered each other. The sea\nrocked the ship in silence, and the phosphorescent waters glistened in\nthe darkness.

He was a man who understood his trade, as\none could see by the way in which he repaired the wheels of the cart. He labored skillfully and with uncommon energy. During the operation, the major noticed that the farrier's wrists were\nconsiderably eroded, and that they were each encircled by a blackish\nring of extravasated blood.

THE PLOT UNVEILED. The sound of the name of Ben Joyce fell upon the party like a\nthunderbolt. Ayrton suddenly sprang to his feet. In his hand was a\nrevolver.

Before Captain Mangles and the sailors recovered from the surprise into\nwhich this unexpected turn of affairs had thrown them, the audacious\nconvict had escaped, and joined his band, scattered along the edge of\nthe wood of gum-trees.

Manuel did not think of any other calling than that of the\nsoldier, and hoped, in time, with the help of God, to offer to the\nrepublic a whole battalion of young soldiers. \"You have seen them?\" said he. \"Charming fellows! Good soldiers! José! Juan! Miguel! Pepe!

Then, controlling\nher emotion, this courageous woman had assisted Glenarvan to the cart. Here the shoulder of the wounded man was laid bare, and the major\nperceived that the ball had lacerated the flesh, causing no other\ninjury. Neither bones nor large muscles seemed affected. The wound bled\nconsiderably, but Glenarvan, by moving the fingers of his hand and\nfore-arm, encouraged his friends to expect a favorable result.

Since the day of his meeting with Ayrton he had suspected him. Two or\nthree almost insignificant circumstances, a glance exchanged between\nthe quartermaster and the farrier at Wimerra River, Ayrton's hesitation\nto pass through the towns and villages, his strong wish to order the\nDuncan to the coast, the strange death of the animals confided to his\ncare, and, finally, a want of frankness in his actions,--all these\nfacts, gradually noticed, had roused the major's suspicions. However, he could form no direct accusation until the events that had\ntranspired the preceding night.

Lady Helena and Mary Grant's first care had been to dress Glenarvan's\nwound. At the very moment that her husband fell, from Ben Joyce's\nbullet, in her terror she had rushed towards him. Then, controlling\nher emotion, this courageous woman had assisted Glenarvan to the cart. Here the shoulder of the wounded man was laid bare, and the major\nperceived that the ball had lacerated the flesh, causing no other\ninjury. Neither bones nor large muscles seemed affected. The wound bled\nconsiderably, but Glenarvan, by moving the fingers of his hand and\nfore-arm, encouraged his friends to expect a favorable result. When his\nwound was dressed, he no longer desired any attention, and explanations\nfollowed. The travelers, except Wilson and Mulready, who were keeping\nguard outside, had taken seats as well as possible in the cart, and the\nmajor was requested to speak. Before beginning his story, he informed Lady Helena of the escape of\na band of convicts from Perth, their appearance in the province of\nVictoria, and their complicity in the railway disaster. He gave her\nthe number of the _Australian and New Zealand Gazette_ purchased at\nSeymour, and added that the police had set a price on the head of Ben\nJoyce, a formidable bandit, whom eighteen months of crime had given a\nwide-spread notoriety. But how had MacNabb recognized this Ben Joyce in the quartermaster\nAyrton? Here was the mystery that all wished to solve; and the major\nexplained. Since the day of his meeting with Ayrton he had suspected him. Two or\nthree almost insignificant circumstances, a glance exchanged between\nthe quartermaster and the farrier at Wimerra River, Ayrton's hesitation\nto pass through the towns and villages, his strong wish to order the\nDuncan to the coast, the strange death of the animals confided to his\ncare, and, finally, a want of frankness in his actions,--all these\nfacts, gradually noticed, had roused the major's suspicions. However, he could form no direct accusation until the events that had\ntranspired the preceding night. Gliding between the tall clumps of\nshrubbery, as was related in the previous chapter, he approached near\nthe suspicious shadows that had attracted his attention half a mile\nfrom the encampment.

He has stolen\nhis name and contract?\" All eyes were turned towards MacNabb, who must have considered this\nmatter. \"These,\" replied he, in his calm voice, \"are the proofs that can be\nderived from this obscure state of affairs. In my opinion this man's\nreal name is Ayrton. Ben Joyce is his fighting title. It is certain\nthat he knows Harry Grant, and has been quartermaster on board the\nBritannia. These facts, proved already by the precise details given\nby Ayrton, are still further corroborated by the conversation of the\nconvicts that I have related. Let us not, therefore, be led astray\nby vain conjectures, but only be certain that Ayrton is Ben Joyce, a\nsailor of the Britannia, now chief of a band of convicts.\" The major's explanation was accepted as conclusive. \"Now,\" replied Glenarvan, \"will you tell me how and why Harry Grant's\nquartermaster is in Australia?\" \"How, I do not know,\" said MacNabb; \"and the police declare they know\nno more than I on the subject. Why, it is also impossible for me to\nsay.

Chance threw us in his way. He heard Glenarvan's story of the\nshipwreck, and, like a bold man, he promptly decided to take part in\nthe expedition. At the Wimerra he communicated with one of his friends,\nthe farrier of Black Point, and thus left distinguishable traces of\nour course. His band followed us. A poisonous plant enabled him to\ngradually kill our oxen and horses. Then, at the proper moment, he\nentangled us in the marshes of the Snowy, and surrendered us to the\nconvicts he commanded.\" Everything possible had been said concerning Ben Joyce. His past had\njust been reviewed by the major, and the wretch appeared as he was,--a\nbold and formidable criminal. His intentions had been clearly proved,\nand required, on the part of Glenarvan, extreme vigilance. Fortunately,\nthere was less to fear from the detected bandit than the secret traitor. But one serious fact appeared from this explanation. No one had yet\nthought of it; only Mary Grant, disregarding the past, looked forward\nto the future. Captain Mangles first saw her pale and disconsolate. He\nunderstood what was passing in her mind. \"Miss Mary!\" cried he, \"you are weeping!\" \"What is the matter, my child?\" asked Lady Helena. \"My father, madam, my father!\" replied the young girl. She could not continue. But a sudden revelation dawned on the mind of\neach. They comprehended Mary's grief, why the tears flowed from her\neyes, why the name of her father rose to her lips. The discovery of Ayrton's treachery destroyed all hope.", "similarity": 0.4682369828224182}, {"chunk_id": 151, "text": "Ayrton\nwould doubtless have been eventually nonplused had they not, after an\nhour's climbing, caught sight of a tavern on one of the paths of the\nmountain. \"Well!\" said Paganel, as they reached the hostelry, \"the proprietor of\nthis inn cannot make a great fortune in such a place. Of what use can\nhe be?\" \"To give us the information we need for our journey,\" replied\nGlenarvan. \"Let us go in.\" Glenarvan, followed by Ayrton, entered the tavern. The landlord of\n\"Bush Inn\" was a coarse man, of forbidding appearance, who had to\nconsider himself as the principal customer for the gin, brandy, and\nwhisky of his tavern, and scarcely ever saw any one but squatters or\nherdsmen. He replied in an ill-humored way to the questions that were addressed\nhim; but his answers sufficed to determine Ayrton upon his course. Glenarvan, however, remunerated the tavern-keeper for the little\ntrouble they had given him, and was about to leave the inn, when a\nplacard, affixed to the wall, attracted his attention. It was a notice\nof the colonial police, detailing the escape of the convicts from\nPerth, and setting a price upon the head of Ben Joyce--a hundred pounds\nsterling to any one who should deliver him up. \"Indeed,\" said Glenarvan, \"that is a rascal worth hanging.\" \"And especially worth taking,\" replied Ayrton. \"A hundred pounds! What\na sum! He is not worth it.\" \"As for the inn-keeper,\" added Glenarvan, as he left the room, \"I\nscarcely put faith in him, despite his placard.\" \"Nor I either,\" said Ayrton. Glenarvan and the quartermaster rejoined the party, and they all\nproceeded to where a narrow pass wound across the chain. Here they\nbegan the ascent. [Sidenote: ANOTHER DEATH.] But it was an arduous task. More than once the ladies and their\ncompanions had to dismount, and it was often necessary to push the\nwheels of the heavy vehicle at some steep ascent, or to hold it\nback along the edge of some dangerous precipice. The oxen, as they\ncould not work to advantage at sudden turns, had frequently to be\nunyoked, and the cart blocked to prevent it from sliding back. Ayrton\nwas repeatedly forced to bring the already exhausted horses to his\nassistance. Whether this exertion was too prolonged, or whether from some other\ncause, one of the horses gave out during the ascent. He fell suddenly,\nwithout an instant's warning. It was Mulready's horse; and when the\nsailor attempted to help him up, he found that he was dead. Ayrton\nexamined the animal carefully, but did not seem to understand the cause\nof this sudden death. \"The beast must have burst a blood-vessel,\" said Glenarvan. \"Evidently,\" replied Ayrton. \"Take my horse, Mulready,\" added Glenarvan; \"I will join Lady Helena in\nthe cart.\" Mulready obeyed, and the little party continued their fatiguing ascent,\nabandoning the body to the crows. The next day they began the descent, which was much more rapid. During\nits course a violent hail-storm burst on them, and they were forced to\nseek a shelter beneath the rocks. Not hailstones, but pieces of ice as\nlarge as one's hand, were precipitated from the angry clouds. A sling\ncould not have hurled them with greater force, and several sharp blows\nwarned Paganel and Robert to be on their guard. The cart was pierced\nthrough in many places: indeed, few roofs could have resisted the fall\nof these cutting missiles, some of which froze to the trunks of the\ntrees.", "similarity": 0.4605594575405121}, {"chunk_id": 160, "text": "The quartermaster made his preparations for departure, aided by the\ntwo sailors, one of whom attended to his horse, and the other to his\nprovisions.

As soon as he arrived at the bay, he was to\nsend a detachment of sailors under the command of Ayrton. He had just reached this part of his letter, when the major, who had\nbeen looking over his shoulder, asked him, in a singular tone, how he\nwrote the word Ayrton. \"As it is pronounced,\" replied Glenarvan. \"That is a mistake,\" said the major coolly. \"It is pronounced Ayrton,\nbut it is written 'Ben Joyce'!\" CHAPTER XLI. THE PLOT UNVEILED. The sound of the name of Ben Joyce fell upon the party like a\nthunderbolt. Ayrton suddenly sprang to his feet. In his hand was a\nrevolver. A report was heard; and Glenarvan fell, struck by a bullet. Before Captain Mangles and the sailors recovered from the surprise into\nwhich this unexpected turn of affairs had thrown them, the audacious\nconvict had escaped, and joined his band, scattered along the edge of\nthe wood of gum-trees. [Illustration: A report was heard; and Glenarvan fell, struck by a\nbullet.] The tent did not offer a sufficient shelter against the bullets, and\nit was clearly necessary to beat a retreat.

Chance alone had led them back to\nthis vessel that they had ceased to regard as theirs, and in what a sad\nstate of exhaustion and feebleness! However, before thinking of fatigue, or the imperative calls of hunger\nand thirst, Glenarvan questioned Tom Austin concerning his presence in\nthese waters. Why was the Duncan on the eastern coast of New Zealand? Why was she not in the hands of Ben Joyce? By what providential working\nhad God restored her to the fugitives? These were the questions that\nwere hurriedly addressed to Tom Austin. The old sailor did not know\nwhich to answer first. He therefore concluded to listen only to Lord\nGlenarvan, and reply to him. \"But the convicts?\" inquired Glenarvan. \"What have you done with the\nconvicts?\" \"The convicts!\" replied Tom Austin, like a man who is at a loss to\nunderstand a question. \"Yes; the wretches who attacked the yacht.\" \"What yacht, my lord? The Duncan?\" \"Of course.

I only conformed to the instructions contained in your\nletter.\" \"My letter?\" exclaimed Glenarvan. The ten travelers at once surrounded Tom Austin, and gazed at him in\neager curiosity. The letter written at the Snowy River had reached the\nDuncan. \"Well,\" continued Glenarvan, \"let us have an explanation; for I almost\nthink I am dreaming. You received a letter, Tom?\" \"Yes; a letter from your lordship.\" \"At Melbourne?\" \"At Melbourne; just as I had finished the repair of the ship.\" \"And this letter?\" \"It was not written by you; but it was signed by you, my lord.\" \"Exactly; it was sent by a convict, Ben Joyce.\" \"No; by the sailor called Ayrton, quartermaster of the Britannia.\" \"Yes, Ayrton or Ben Joyce; it is the same person.

Australia!\" replied Glenarvan's companions, with one\nvoice. [Illustration: As soon as they set foot on deck the bagpiper struck up\na well remembered air, while hearty hurrahs welcomed the owner's return\non board.] Austin was now bewildered.

The landlord of\n\"Bush Inn\" was a coarse man, of forbidding appearance, who had to\nconsider himself as the principal customer for the gin, brandy, and\nwhisky of his tavern, and scarcely ever saw any one but squatters or\nherdsmen. He replied in an ill-humored way to the questions that were addressed\nhim; but his answers sufficed to determine Ayrton upon his course. Glenarvan, however, remunerated the tavern-keeper for the little\ntrouble they had given him, and was about to leave the inn, when a\nplacard, affixed to the wall, attracted his attention. It was a notice\nof the colonial police, detailing the escape of the convicts from\nPerth, and setting a price upon the head of Ben Joyce--a hundred pounds\nsterling to any one who should deliver him up. \"Indeed,\" said Glenarvan, \"that is a rascal worth hanging.\" \"And especially worth taking,\" replied Ayrton. \"A hundred pounds!

The oxen, as they\ncould not work to advantage at sudden turns, had frequently to be\nunyoked, and the cart blocked to prevent it from sliding back. Ayrton\nwas repeatedly forced to bring the already exhausted horses to his\nassistance. Whether this exertion was too prolonged, or whether from some other\ncause, one of the horses gave out during the ascent. He fell suddenly,\nwithout an instant's warning. It was Mulready's horse; and when the\nsailor attempted to help him up, he found that he was dead. Ayrton\nexamined the animal carefully, but did not seem to understand the cause\nof this sudden death. \"The beast must have burst a blood-vessel,\" said Glenarvan. \"Evidently,\" replied Ayrton. \"Take my horse, Mulready,\" added Glenarvan; \"I will join Lady Helena in\nthe cart.\" Mulready obeyed, and the little party continued their fatiguing ascent,\nabandoning the body to the crows.

One night more and he would be on his way. The night was one of feverish distraction, and in its progress visions,\ngood and evil, passed through Dantès’ mind.

He\nascended into grottos paved with emeralds, with panels of rubies, and\nthe roof glowing with diamond stalactites. Pearls fell drop by drop, as\nsubterranean waters filter in their caves. Edmond, amazed,\nwonderstruck, filled his pockets with the radiant gems and then\nreturned to daylight, when he discovered that his prizes had all\nchanged into common pebbles. He then endeavored to re-enter the\nmarvellous grottos, but they had suddenly receded, and now the path\nbecame a labyrinth, and then the entrance vanished, and in vain did he\ntax his memory for the magic and mysterious word which opened the\nsplendid caverns of Ali Baba to the Arabian fisherman. All was useless,\nthe treasure disappeared, and had again reverted to the genii from whom\nfor a moment he had hoped to carry it off. The day came at length, and was almost as feverish as the night had\nbeen, but it brought reason to the aid of imagination, and Dantès was\nthen enabled to arrange a plan which had hitherto been vague and\nunsettled in his brain. Night came, and with it the preparation for\ndeparture, and these preparations served to conceal Dantès’ agitation. He had by degrees assumed such authority over his companions that he\nwas almost like a commander on board; and as his orders were always\nclear, distinct, and easy of execution, his comrades obeyed him with\ncelerity and pleasure. The old patron did not interfere, for he too had recognized the\nsuperiority of Dantès over the crew and himself. He saw in the young\nman his natural successor, and regretted that he had not a daughter,\nthat he might have bound Edmond to him by a more secure alliance. At\nseven o’clock in the evening all was ready, and at ten minutes past\nseven they doubled the lighthouse just as the beacon was kindled. The\nsea was calm, and, with a fresh breeze from the south-east, they sailed\nbeneath a bright blue sky, in which God also lighted up in turn his\nbeacon lights, each of which is a world. Dantès told them that all\nhands might turn in, and he would take the helm. When the Maltese (for\nso they called Dantès) had said this, it was sufficient, and all went\nto their bunks contentedly. This frequently happened. Dantès, cast from solitude into the world,\nfrequently experienced an imperious desire for solitude; and what\nsolitude is more complete, or more poetical, than that of a ship\nfloating in isolation on the sea during the obscurity of the night, in\nthe silence of immensity, and under the eye of Heaven? Now this solitude was peopled with his thoughts, the night lighted up\nby his illusions, and the silence animated by his anticipations.

On landing, the count turned towards the cemetery, where he felt sure\nof finding Morrel. He, too, ten years ago, had piously sought out a\ntomb, and sought it vainly. He, who returned to France with millions,\nhad been unable to find the grave of his father, who had perished from\nhunger.

Two large slabs of marble, on\nwhich were inscribed their names, were placed on either side of a\nlittle enclosure, railed in, and shaded by four cypress-trees.

The Third Attack\n\nNow that this treasure, which had so long been the object of the abbé’s\nmeditations, could insure the future happiness of him whom Faria really\nloved as a son, it had doubled its value in his eyes, and every day he\nexpatiated on the amount, explaining to Dantès all the good which, with\nthirteen or fourteen millions of francs, a man could do in these days\nto his friends; and then Dantès’ countenance became gloomy, for the\noath of vengeance he had taken recurred to his memory, and he reflected\nhow much ill, in these times, a man with thirteen or fourteen millions\ncould do to his enemies. The abbé did not know the Island of Monte Cristo; but Dantès knew it,\nand had often passed it, situated twenty-five miles from Pianosa,\nbetween Corsica and the Island of Elba, and had once touched there. This island was, always had been, and still is, completely deserted. It\nis a rock of almost conical form, which looks as though it had been\nthrust up by volcanic force from the depth to the surface of the ocean. Dantès drew a plan of the island for Faria, and Faria gave Dantès\nadvice as to the means he should employ to recover the treasure. But\nDantès was far from being as enthusiastic and confident as the old man. It was past a question now that Faria was not a lunatic, and the way in\nwhich he had achieved the discovery, which had given rise to the\nsuspicion of his madness, increased Edmond’s admiration of him; but at\nthe same time Dantès could not believe that the deposit, supposing it\nhad ever existed, still existed; and though he considered the treasure\nas by no means chimerical, he yet believed it was no longer there. However, as if fate resolved on depriving the prisoners of their last\nchance, and making them understand that they were condemned to\nperpetual imprisonment, a new misfortune befell them; the gallery on\nthe sea side, which had long been in ruins, was rebuilt. They had\nrepaired it completely, and stopped up with vast masses of stone the\nhole Dantès had partly filled in. But for this precaution, which, it\nwill be remembered, the abbé had made to Edmond, the misfortune would\nhave been still greater, for their attempt to escape would have been\ndetected, and they would undoubtedly have been separated. Thus a new, a\nstronger, and more inexorable barrier was interposed to cut off the\nrealization of their hopes. “You see,” said the young man, with an air of sorrowful resignation, to\nFaria, “that God deems it right to take from me any claim to merit for\nwhat you call my devotion to you.

But what would the geographer say, when he learned the name\nand destination of the vessel on which he had taken passage? \"So, Monsieur Paganel,\" said Glenarvan, \"you have chosen Calcutta as\nyour centre of action?\" \"Yes, my lord. To see India is an idea that I have cherished all my\nlife. It is my brightest dream, which shall be realized at last in the\ncountry of the elephants and the Thugs.\" \"Then you would not care to visit another country?\" \"No, my lord; it would be even disagreeable, for I have letters from\nLord Somerset to the governor-general of India, and a mission from the\nGeographical Society which I must fulfil.\" \"Ah! you have a mission?\" \"Yes, a useful and curious voyage to undertake, the programme of\nwhich has been arranged by my scientific friend and colleague, M.\nVivien de Saint Martin. It is to follow in the steps of the brothers\nSchlagintweit, and many other celebrated travelers. I hope to succeed\nwhere Missionary Krick unfortunately failed in 1846.

He spoke with a lofty animation, and was\ncarried away in the rapid flight of imagination. It would have been\nas impossible to check him as to stay the Rhine at the Falls of\nSchaffhausen. \"Monsieur Jacques Paganel,\" said Lord Glenarvan, after a moment\nof silence, \"that is certainly a fine voyage, and one for which\nscience would be very grateful; but I will not further prolong your\nignorance.

You would have thought a coroner was pointing\nout the particulars of a suspicious quest. And Glenarvan was right,\nfor the most insignificant mark in appearance may often lead to an\nimportant discovery. Before examining it internally, the bottle was inspected externally. It had a slender neck, the mouth of which was protected by an\niron wire considerably rusted. Its sides were very thick, and\ncapable of supporting a pressure of several atmospheres, betraying\nevidently previous connection with champagne. With these bottles the\nwine-dressers of Aï and Epernay block carriage-wheels without their\nshowing the slightest fracture. This one could, therefore, easily bear\nthe hardships of a long voyage.

See the petrified particles that\ncover it, these substances mineralized, so to speak, under the action\nof the sea-water. This waif had already taken a long voyage in the\nocean, before being engulfed in the stomach of a shark.\" \"I cannot but be of your opinion,\" replied the major; \"this fragile\nvase, protected by its strong envelope, must have made a long journey.\" \"But whence does it come?\" inquired Lady Glenarvan. \"Wait, my dear Helena, wait. We must be patient with bottles. If I am\nnot greatly mistaken, this one will itself answer all our questions.\" And so saying, Glenarvan began to scrape off the hard particles that\nprotected the neck. Soon the cork appeared, but very much damaged with\nthe salt water. \"This is a pity,\" said Glenarvan; \"for if there is any paper in it, it\nwill be in a bad condition.\" \"That's what I fear,\" replied the major. \"I will add,\" continued Glenarvan, \"that this badly-corked bottle would\nsoon have sunk; and it is fortunate that this shark swallowed it, and\nbrought it on board of the Duncan.\" \"Certainly,\" interposed Captain Mangles; \"it would have been better,\nhowever, had it been caught in the open sea on a well-known latitude\nand longitude. We could then, by studying the atmospheric and marine\ncurrents, have discovered the course traversed; but with a guide like\none of these sharks, that travel against wind and tide, we cannot know\nwhence it comes.\" \"We shall soon see,\" answered Glenarvan. At the same time he drew out\nthe cork with the greatest care, and a strong saline odor permeated the\ncabin. \"Well?\" said Lady Helena, with a truly feminine impatience. \"Yes,\" said Glenarvan; \"I am not mistaken!

His eccentricities (and his abilities) made him much talked of in\nScotland. People seemed as though they could not show him enough\nattention. Just at this time an amiable lady of thirty, none other than the\nmajor's cousin, a little eccentric herself, but still agreeable and\ncharming, fell in love with the geographer's peculiarities. Paganel was\nfar from being insensible to Miss Arabella's attractions, yet did not\ndare to declare his sentiments. The major accordingly undertook the\npart of Cupid's messenger between these two congenial hearts, and even\ntold Paganel that marriage was \"the last blunder\" that he could commit. But the geographer was very much embarrassed, and, strangely enough,\ncould not summon courage to speak for himself. [Illustration: Early in the afternoon the travelers reached Malcolm\nCastle, amidst the hurrahs of their tenantry and friends.] \"Does not Miss Arabella please you?\" MacNabb would say to him. \"Oh, major, she is charming!\" cried Paganel,--\"a thousand times too\ncharming for me; and, if I must tell you, would please me better if she\nwere less so. I should like to find a defect.\" \"Be easy,\" answered the major; \"she has more than one. The most perfect\nwoman always has her share. Well, then, Paganel, are you decided?\" \"I do not dare.\" \"But, my learned friend, why do you hesitate?\" \"I am unworthy of her!\" was the geographer's invariable reply. At last, one day, driven desperate by the irrepressible major, Paganel\nconfessed to him, under the pledge of secrecy, a peculiarity that would\nfacilitate his identification, if the police should ever be on his\ntrack! \"Bah!\" exclaimed the major. \"It is as I tell you,\" persisted Paganel. \"What matter, my worthy friend?\" \"Is that your opinion?\" \"On the contrary, you are only more remarkable. This adds to your\npersonal advantages.

Manuel did not think of any other calling than that of the\nsoldier, and hoped, in time, with the help of God, to offer to the\nrepublic a whole battalion of young soldiers. \"You have seen them?\" said he. \"Charming fellows! Good soldiers! José! Juan! Miguel! Pepe! Pepe is only seven years old, and is already biting\nhis cartridge!\" Pepe, hearing himself complimented, joined his two little feet, and\npresented arms with perfect precision. \"He will do!\" added the sergeant. \"He will be a major--or\nbrigadier-general one day!\" This story lasted a quarter of an hour, to Thalcave's great\nastonishment. The Indian could not understand how so many words could\ncome from a single throat. No one interrupted the commander; and even\na French sergeant had to conclude at last, though not without forcing\nhis guests to accompany him to his dwelling. Here they were introduced\nto Madame Ipharaguerre, who appeared to be \"a good-looking person,\" if\nthis expression may be employed in regard to an Indian. When he had exhausted himself, the sergeant asked his guests to what he\nowed the honor of their visit. And now it was their turn to explain. Paganel, opening the conversation in French, told him of their journey\nacross the Pampas, and ended by asking why the Indians had abandoned\nthe country. \"War!\" replied the sergeant. \"War?\" \"Yes, civil war.\" \"Civil war?\" rejoined Paganel. \"Yes, war between Paraguay and Buenos Ayres,\" answered the sergeant. \"Well?\" \"Why, all the Indians of the north are in the rear of General Flores,\nand those of the plains are plundering.\" \"But the caziques?\" \"The caziques with them.\" This answer was reported to Thalcave, who shook his head. Indeed,\nhe either did not know, or had forgotten, that a civil war, which\nwas afterwards to involve Brazil, was decimating two-thirds of the\nrepublic. The Indians had everything to gain in these internal\nstruggles, and could not neglect such fine opportunities for plunder. The sergeant, therefore, was not mistaken in attributing this desertion\nof the Pampas to the civil war that was being waged in the northern\npart of the Argentine Provinces. But this event disconcerted Glenarvan's hopes. If Captain Grant was\na prisoner of the caziques, he must have been carried by them to the\nnorthern frontiers. Yet how and where to find him? Must they attempt\na perilous and almost useless search to the northern limits of the\nPampas? It was a serious matter, which was to be earnestly considered. However, one important question was still to be asked of the sergeant,\nand the major thought of this, while his companions were looking at\neach other in silence. \"Have you heard of any Europeans being retained as prisoners by the\ncaziques of the Pampas?\" Manuel reflected for a few moments, like a man who recalls events to\nrecollection. \"Yes,\" said he, at length. \"Ah!\" cried Glenarvan, conceiving a new hope.

Since you crossed the Pampas, you\ncould not at the same time double Cape Horn.\" \"Nevertheless, I am sorry,\" replied the geographer.

The taboo, which is common to the tribes of Polynesia, has the power\nto prohibit at once all connection with the object or person tabooed. According to the Maori religion, whoever should lay his sacrilegious\nhand on what is declared taboo would be punished with death by the\noffended god; and in case the divinity should delay to avenge his own\ninsult, the priests would not fail to excite his anger. As for the prisoners confined in the temple, the taboo had rescued\nthem from the fury of the tribe. Some of the natives, the friends and\npartisans of Kai-Koumou, had stopped suddenly at the command of their\nchief, and had protected the captives. [Sidenote: THE TORTURES OF SUSPENSE.] Glenarvan, however, was not blind to the fate that was reserved for\nhim. Only his death could atone for the murder of a chief. Among savage\nraces death is always preceded by a protracted torture. He therefore\nexpected to cruelly expiate the righteous indignation that had nerved\nhis arm, but hoped that Kai-Koumou's rage would fall only on himself. What a night he and his companions passed! Who could depict their\nanguish, or measure their sufferings? Neither poor Robert nor brave\nPaganel had reappeared. But how could they doubt their fate? Were they\nnot the first victims of the natives' vengeance? All hope had vanished\neven from the heart of the major, who did not easily despair. John\nMangles felt himself growing mad at sight of the sad dejection of Mary\nGrant, thus separated from her brother. Glenarvan thought of that\nterrible request of Lady Helena, who, rather than yield to torture or\nslavery, preferred to die by his hand. Could he summon this fearful\ncourage? As for an escape, that was plainly impossible. Ten warriors,\narmed to the teeth, guarded the entrance of the temple. Morning came at last. There had been no communication between the\nnatives and the prisoners. The hut contained a considerable quantity\nof food, which the unfortunates scarcely touched. Hunger gave place to\ngrief. The day passed without bringing a change or a hope. Doubtless\nthe hour for the dead chief's funeral and their torture would be the\nsame. However, although Glenarvan concluded that Kai-Koumou must have\nabandoned all idea of exchange, the major on this point retained a\ngleam of hope. \"Who knows,\" said he, reminding Glenarvan of the effect produced upon\nthe chief by the death of Kara-Tété,--\"who knows but that Kai-Koumou in\nreality feels obliged to you?\" But, in spite of these observations, Glenarvan would no longer hope. The next day also passed away without the preparations for torture\nbeing made. The reason of the delay was this. The Maoris believe that the soul, for three days after death, inhabits\nthe body of the deceased, and therefore during this time the corpse\nremains unburied. This custom was rigorously observed, and for two days\nthe pah was deserted. Captain Mangles frequently stood on Wilson's\nshoulders and surveyed the fortification.

The major, like a perfect horseman,\nadmired unreservedly this specimen of the horses of the plains. This\nbeautiful creature was called Thaouka, which means \"bird\" in the\nPatagonian language, and he justly merited this appellation. [Sidenote: A FRESH START.] When Thalcave was in the saddle, the horse pranced with spirited grace,\nand the Patagonian, a skillful rider, was magnificent to behold. His\noutfit comprised two weapons of the chase, the \"bolas\" and the lasso. The bolas consists of three balls tied together by a leathern string,\nwhich are fastened to the front of the saddle. The Indians frequently\nthrow them the distance of a hundred paces at the animal or enemy that\nthey are pursuing, and with such precision that they twist about their\nlegs and bring them to the ground. It is, therefore, in their hands a\nformidable instrument, and they handle it with surprising dexterity. The lasso, on the contrary, does not leave the hand that wields it. It\nconsists simply of a leathern thong thirty feet in length, terminating\nin a slip-noose which works upon an iron ring. The right hand throws\nthe slip-noose, while the left hand holds the remainder of the lasso,\nthe end of which is firmly tied to the saddle. A long carbine in a\nsling completed the Patagonian's armament. Thalcave, without observing the admiration caused by his natural\ngrace, ease and courage, took the lead, and the party advanced, now\nat a gallop, and now at a walk, for their horses seemed entirely\nunaccustomed to trotting. Robert mounted with much boldness, and\nspeedily convinced Glenarvan of his ability to keep his seat. On issuing from the gorges of the Andes, they encountered a great\nnumber of sand-ridges, called \"medanos,\" real waves incessantly\nagitated by the wind, when the roots of the herbage did not confine\nthem to the earth. This sand is of an extreme fineness; and, at the\nleast breath, they saw it float away in light clouds, or form regular\nsand-columns which rose to a considerable height. This spectacle caused\npleasure as well as annoyance to the eyes. Pleasure, for nothing was\nmore curious than these columns, wandering over the plain, struggling,\nmingling, sinking and rising in inexpressible confusion; and annoyance,\nsince an impalpable dust emanated from these innumerable medanos and\npenetrated the eyelids, however tightly they were closed. [Illustration]\n\nThis phenomenon continued during a great part of the day. Nevertheless,\nthey advanced rapidly, and towards six o'clock the Andes, forty miles\ndistant, presented a darkish aspect already fading in the mists of the\nevening. The travelers were a little fatigued with their journey, and,\ntherefore, saw with pleasure the approach of the hour for retiring. They encamped on the shores of a turbulent stream, enclosed by lofty\nred cliffs. Toward noon of the next day, the sun's rays became very\noppressive, and at evening a line of clouds on the horizon indicated\na change in the weather. The Patagonian could not be deceived, and\npointed out to the geographer the western portion of the sky. \"Good, I know,\" said Paganel, and addressing his companions: \"A change\nin the weather is about to take place.

Then, after a few moments, he resumed, more coolly:\n\n\"Do you think the English will give us our Tohonga in exchange for you?\" Glenarvan hesitated, and watched the Maori chief very attentively. \"I do not know,\" said he, after a moment's silence. \"Speak,\" continued Kai-Koumou. \"Is your life worth that of our Tohonga?\" \"No,\" answered Glenarvan. \"I am neither a chief nor a priest among my\npeople.\" Paganel was astounded at this reply, and gazed at Glenarvan in profound\nwonder. Kai-Koumou seemed equally surprised. \"Then you doubt it?\" said he. \"I do not know,\" repeated Glenarvan. \"Will not your people accept you in exchange for our Tohonga?\" \"Not me alone,\" replied Glenarvan; \"but perhaps all of us.\" \"Among the Maoris,\" said Kai-Koumou, \"it is one for one.\" \"Offer these ladies first in exchange for your priest,\" answered\nGlenarvan, pointing to Lady Helena and Mary Grant. Lady Helena would\nhave rushed towards her husband, but the major restrained her. \"These two ladies,\" continued Glenarvan, turning respectfully towards\nthem, \"hold a high rank in their country.\" The warrior glanced coldly at his prisoner. A malicious smile passed\nover his face; but he almost instantly repressed it, and replied, in a\nvoice which he could scarcely control:\n\n\"Do you hope, then, to deceive Kai-Koumou by false words, cursed\nEuropean? Do you think that Kai-Koumou's eyes cannot read your heart?\" Then, pointing to Lady Helena, he said:\n\n\"That is your wife!\" \"No, mine!\" cried Kara-Tété. Then, pushing back the prisoners, the chief laid his hand on Lady\nHelena's shoulder, who grew pale at the touch. \"Edward!\" cried the unfortunate woman, in terror. Glenarvan, without uttering a word, raised his arm. A report resounded. Kara-Tété fell dead. At this sound a crowd of natives issued from the huts. The pah was\nfilled in an instant. A hundred arms were raised against the captives. Glenarvan's revolver was snatched from his hand.

A\nhorrible death was in store for them,--to perish either by the flames\nor by the teeth of the alligators. There are circumstances in which\nman is powerless to struggle, and where a raging element can only be\nrepulsed by another equally strong. Glenarvan, with a wild look, gazed\nat the fire and water leagued against him, not knowing what aid to\nimplore of Heaven. The storm had now begun to abate; but it had developed in the air a\ngreat quantity of vapor, which the electric phenomena were about to\nset in violent commotion. To the south an enormous water-spout was\ngradually forming,--an inverted cone of mist, uniting the raging waters\nbelow to the stormy clouds above. It advanced revolving with frightful\nrapidity, collected at its centre a liquid column, and by a powerful\nattraction, caused by its gyratory motion, drew towards it all the\nsurrounding currents of air. [Sidenote: A STRANGE BARK.] In a few moments the gigantic water-spout struck the ombu and enveloped\nit in its watery folds.

The taboo, which is common to the tribes of Polynesia, has the power\nto prohibit at once all connection with the object or person tabooed. According to the Maori religion, whoever should lay his sacrilegious\nhand on what is declared taboo would be punished with death by the\noffended god; and in case the divinity should delay to avenge his own\ninsult, the priests would not fail to excite his anger. As for the prisoners confined in the temple, the taboo had rescued\nthem from the fury of the tribe. Some of the natives, the friends and\npartisans of Kai-Koumou, had stopped suddenly at the command of their\nchief, and had protected the captives. [Sidenote: THE TORTURES OF SUSPENSE.] Glenarvan, however, was not blind to the fate that was reserved for\nhim. Only his death could atone for the murder of a chief. Among savage\nraces death is always preceded by a protracted torture. He therefore\nexpected to cruelly expiate the righteous indignation that had nerved\nhis arm, but hoped that Kai-Koumou's rage would fall only on himself. What a night he and his companions passed! Who could depict their\nanguish, or measure their sufferings? Neither poor Robert nor brave\nPaganel had reappeared. But how could they doubt their fate? Were they\nnot the first victims of the natives' vengeance? All hope had vanished\neven from the heart of the major, who did not easily despair. John\nMangles felt himself growing mad at sight of the sad dejection of Mary\nGrant, thus separated from her brother. Glenarvan thought of that\nterrible request of Lady Helena, who, rather than yield to torture or\nslavery, preferred to die by his hand. Could he summon this fearful\ncourage? As for an escape, that was plainly impossible. Ten warriors,\narmed to the teeth, guarded the entrance of the temple. Morning came at last. There had been no communication between the\nnatives and the prisoners. The hut contained a considerable quantity\nof food, which the unfortunates scarcely touched. Hunger gave place to\ngrief. The day passed without bringing a change or a hope. Doubtless\nthe hour for the dead chief's funeral and their torture would be the\nsame. However, although Glenarvan concluded that Kai-Koumou must have\nabandoned all idea of exchange, the major on this point retained a\ngleam of hope. \"Who knows,\" said he, reminding Glenarvan of the effect produced upon\nthe chief by the death of Kara-Tété,--\"who knows but that Kai-Koumou in\nreality feels obliged to you?\" But, in spite of these observations, Glenarvan would no longer hope. The next day also passed away without the preparations for torture\nbeing made. The reason of the delay was this. The Maoris believe that the soul, for three days after death, inhabits\nthe body of the deceased, and therefore during this time the corpse\nremains unburied. This custom was rigorously observed, and for two days\nthe pah was deserted. Captain Mangles frequently stood on Wilson's\nshoulders and surveyed the fortification. No native was seen; only the\nsentinels guarded in turn at the door of their prison. But on the third day the huts were opened.

Then, after a few moments, he resumed, more coolly:\n\n\"Do you think the English will give us our Tohonga in exchange for you?\" Glenarvan hesitated, and watched the Maori chief very attentively. \"I do not know,\" said he, after a moment's silence. \"Speak,\" continued Kai-Koumou. \"Is your life worth that of our Tohonga?\" \"No,\" answered Glenarvan. \"I am neither a chief nor a priest among my\npeople.\" Paganel was astounded at this reply, and gazed at Glenarvan in profound\nwonder. Kai-Koumou seemed equally surprised. \"Then you doubt it?\" said he. \"I do not know,\" repeated Glenarvan. \"Will not your people accept you in exchange for our Tohonga?\" \"Not me alone,\" replied Glenarvan; \"but perhaps all of us.\" \"Among the Maoris,\" said Kai-Koumou, \"it is one for one.\" \"Offer these ladies first in exchange for your priest,\" answered\nGlenarvan, pointing to Lady Helena and Mary Grant. Lady Helena would\nhave rushed towards her husband, but the major restrained her. \"These two ladies,\" continued Glenarvan, turning respectfully towards\nthem, \"hold a high rank in their country.\" The warrior glanced coldly at his prisoner. A malicious smile passed\nover his face; but he almost instantly repressed it, and replied, in a\nvoice which he could scarcely control:\n\n\"Do you hope, then, to deceive Kai-Koumou by false words, cursed\nEuropean? Do you think that Kai-Koumou's eyes cannot read your heart?\" Then, pointing to Lady Helena, he said:\n\n\"That is your wife!\" \"No, mine!\" cried Kara-Tété. Then, pushing back the prisoners, the chief laid his hand on Lady\nHelena's shoulder, who grew pale at the touch. \"Edward!\" cried the unfortunate woman, in terror. Glenarvan, without uttering a word, raised his arm. A report resounded. Kara-Tété fell dead. At this sound a crowd of natives issued from the huts. The pah was\nfilled in an instant. A hundred arms were raised against the captives. Glenarvan's revolver was snatched from his hand. Kai-Koumou cast a strange look at Glenarvan, and then, guarding with\none hand the person of him who had fired, he controlled with the other\nthe throng that was rushing upon the Europeans.

Ah,\nit is beginning!\" [Sidenote: AN EXTRAORDINARY STORM.] Violent thunder-claps interrupted this conversation, and their\nintensity increased till they reached the most deafening peals.

The firmament was on fire, and during this commotion\nit was impossible to distinguish from what electric spark emanated\nthe indefinitely-prolonged rumblings that reverberated throughout the\nabysses of the sky. The incessant flashes assumed various forms. Some, darting\nperpendicularly towards the earth, were repeated five or six times in\nthe same place; others, separating into a thousand different branches,\nspread in zigzag lines and produced on the dark vault of the heavens\nastonishing jets of arborescent flame. Soon the sky, from east to\nnorth, was crossed by a phosphorescent band of intense brilliancy. This\nillumination gradually overspread the entire horizon, lighting up the\nclouds like a bonfire, and was reflected in the mirror-like waters,\nforming what seemed to be an immense circle of fire, of which the tree\noccupied the centre. Glenarvan and his companions watched this terrific spectacle in\nsilence. Sheets of dazzling light glided towards them, and blinding\nflashes followed in rapid succession, now showing the calm countenance\nof the major, then the speculative face of Paganel or the energetic\nfeatures of Glenarvan, and again the frightened look of Robert or the\nunconcerned expression of the sailors.

But soon the flood-gates of the heavens\nopened, and the rain came down in torrents, the drops, as they struck\nthe surface of the water, rebounding in thousands of sparks illuminated\nby the incessant lightning. Did this rain predict the end of the storm? Were Glenarvan and his\ncompanions to be released with a few thorough drenchings? At the height\nof this struggle of the elements, suddenly there appeared at the end\nof the branch which extended horizontally, a flaming globe, of the\nsize of a fist, and surrounded by a black smoke.

A year after his arrival\nin the country, Sergeant Manuel was naturalized, joined the Argentine\narmy, and married an honest Indian woman, who had twins,--boys, to be\nsure, for the sergeant's worthy consort would never present him with\ndaughters. Manuel did not think of any other calling than that of the\nsoldier, and hoped, in time, with the help of God, to offer to the\nrepublic a whole battalion of young soldiers. \"You have seen them?\" said he. \"Charming fellows! Good soldiers! José! Juan! Miguel! Pepe! Pepe is only seven years old, and is already biting\nhis cartridge!\" Pepe, hearing himself complimented, joined his two little feet, and\npresented arms with perfect precision. \"He will do!\" added the sergeant. \"He will be a major--or\nbrigadier-general one day!\" This story lasted a quarter of an hour, to Thalcave's great\nastonishment. The Indian could not understand how so many words could\ncome from a single throat. No one interrupted the commander; and even\na French sergeant had to conclude at last, though not without forcing\nhis guests to accompany him to his dwelling. Here they were introduced\nto Madame Ipharaguerre, who appeared to be \"a good-looking person,\" if\nthis expression may be employed in regard to an Indian. When he had exhausted himself, the sergeant asked his guests to what he\nowed the honor of their visit. And now it was their turn to explain. Paganel, opening the conversation in French, told him of their journey\nacross the Pampas, and ended by asking why the Indians had abandoned\nthe country. \"War!\" replied the sergeant. \"War?\" \"Yes, civil war.\" \"Civil war?\" rejoined Paganel. \"Yes, war between Paraguay and Buenos Ayres,\" answered the sergeant. \"Well?\" \"Why, all the Indians of the north are in the rear of General Flores,\nand those of the plains are plundering.\" \"But the caziques?\" \"The caziques with them.\" This answer was reported to Thalcave, who shook his head. Indeed,\nhe either did not know, or had forgotten, that a civil war, which\nwas afterwards to involve Brazil, was decimating two-thirds of the\nrepublic. The Indians had everything to gain in these internal\nstruggles, and could not neglect such fine opportunities for plunder. The sergeant, therefore, was not mistaken in attributing this desertion\nof the Pampas to the civil war that was being waged in the northern\npart of the Argentine Provinces. But this event disconcerted Glenarvan's hopes. If Captain Grant was\na prisoner of the caziques, he must have been carried by them to the\nnorthern frontiers. Yet how and where to find him? Must they attempt\na perilous and almost useless search to the northern limits of the\nPampas? It was a serious matter, which was to be earnestly considered. However, one important question was still to be asked of the sergeant,\nand the major thought of this, while his companions were looking at\neach other in silence. \"Have you heard of any Europeans being retained as prisoners by the\ncaziques of the Pampas?\" Manuel reflected for a few moments, like a man who recalls events to\nrecollection. \"Yes,\" said he, at length. \"Ah!\" cried Glenarvan, conceiving a new hope.

Having discovered a whole cargo of odd books in the mate's\nchests, and among them a number of Cervantes' works, the Frenchman\nresolved to learn Spanish, which nobody on board knew, and which would\nfacilitate his search on the shores of Chili. Thanks to his love for\nphilology, he did not despair of speaking this new tongue fluently on\narriving at Concepcion. He therefore studied assiduously, and was heard\nincessantly muttering heterogeneous syllables. During his leisure hours\nhe did not fail to give young Robert practical instruction, and taught\nhim the history of the country they were rapidly approaching. In the meantime the Duncan was proceeding at a remarkable rate. She\ncut the Tropic of Capricorn, and her prow was headed toward the strait\nof the celebrated geographer. Now and then the low shores of Patagonia\nwere seen, but like an almost invisible line on the horizon. They\nsailed along the coast for more than ten miles, but Paganel's famous\ntelescope gave him only a vague idea of these American shores. The vessel soon found herself at the head of the strait, and entered\nwithout hesitation. This way is generally preferred by steam-vessels\nbound for the Pacific. Its exact length is three hundred and\nseventy-six miles. Ships of the greatest tonnage can always find deep\nwater, even near its shores, an excellent bottom, and many springs of\nwater. The rivers abound in fish, the forest in game, there are safe\nand easy landings at twenty places, and, in short, a thousand resources\nthat are wanting in the Strait of Lemaire, and off the terrible rocks\nof Cape Horn, which are continually visited by storms and tempests. [Illustration: Sometimes the tips of her yards would graze the branches\nof the beeches that hung over the waves.] During the first hours of the passage, till you reach Cape Gregory,\nthe shores are low and sandy. The entire passage lasted scarcely\nthirty-six hours, and this moving panorama of the two shores well\nrewarded the pains the geographer took to admire it under the radiant\nbeams of the southern sun. No inhabitant appeared on the shores of the\ncontinent; and only a few Fuegians wandered along the barren rocks of\nTerra del Fuego. At one moment the Duncan rounded the peninsula of Brunswick between\ntwo magnificent sights. Just here the strait cuts between stupendous\nmasses of granite. The base of the mountains was hidden in the heart\nof immense forests, while their summits, whitened with eternal snow,\nwere lost in the clouds. Towards the southeast Mount Taru towered\nsix thousand five hundred feet aloft. Night came, preceded by a long\ntwilight, the light melting away insensibly by gentle degrees, while\nthe sky was studded with brilliant stars.", "similarity": 0.3678508996963501}, {"chunk_id": 52, "text": "to start for India and arrive at Chili! to learn Spanish and speak Portuguese! this is too much, and, if it\ncontinues, I shall some day throw myself out of the window instead of\nmy cigar.\" To hear Paganel take his blunder thus, to see his comical actions, it\nwas impossible to keep serious. Besides, he set the example himself. \"Laugh, my friends,\" said he, \"laugh with a will! you cannot laugh as\nmuch as I do at myself.\" And he uttered the most formidable peal of laughter that ever issued\nfrom the mouth of a geographer. \"But we are none the less without an interpreter,\" said the major. \"Oh, do not be troubled,\" replied Paganel. \"The Portuguese and Spanish\nresemble each other so much that I made a mistake. However, this very\nresemblance will soon enable me to rectify my error, and in a short\ntime I will thank this worthy Patagonian in the language he speaks so\nwell.\" Paganel was right, for he could soon exchange a few words with the\nnative. He even learned that his name was Thalcave, a word which\nsignifies in Araucanian \"the thunderer.\" This surname was doubtless\ngiven to him for his skill in the use of fire-arms. [Sidenote: BETTER PROSPECTS.] But Glenarvan was particularly rejoiced to discover that the Patagonian\nwas a guide, and, moreover, a guide of the Pampas. There was,\ntherefore, something so providential in this meeting that the success\nof the enterprise seemed already an accomplished fact, and no one any\nlonger doubted the rescue of Captain Grant. In the meantime the travelers and the Patagonian had returned to\nRobert. The latter stretched his arms towards the native, who, without\na word, placed his hand upon his head. He examined the child and felt\nhis wounded limbs. Then, smiling, he went and gathered on the banks\nof the stream a few handfuls of wild celery, with which he rubbed the\nboy's body. Under this treatment, performed with an extreme gentleness,\nthe child felt his strength revive, and it was plain that a few hours\nwould suffice to restore him. It was therefore decided that that day and the following night should\nbe passed at the encampment. Besides, two important questions remained\nto be settled--food, and means of conveyance. Provisions and mules were\nboth wanting. Fortunately Thalcave solved the difficulty. This guide, who was\naccustomed to conduct travelers along the Patagonian frontiers, and\nwas one of the most intelligent baqueanos of the country, engaged to\nfurnish Glenarvan all that his little party needed. He offered to take\nhim to a \"tolderia\" (encampment) of Indians, about four miles distant,\nwhere they would find everything necessary for the expedition. This\nproposal was made partly by gestures, partly by Spanish words which\nPaganel succeeded in understanding. It was accepted, and Glenarvan and\nhis learned friend, taking leave of their companions, reascended the\nstream under the guidance of the Patagonian. They proceeded at a good pace for an hour and a half, taking long\nstrides to keep up to the giant Thalcave. All the region was charming,\nand of a rich fertility. The grassy pastures succeeded each other,\nand could easily have fed thousands of cattle. Large ponds, united by\na winding chain of streams, gave these plains a verdant moisture. Black-headed swans sported on the mirror-like surface, and disputed the\nempire of the waters with numberless ostriches that gamboled over the\nplains, while the brilliant feathered tribes were in wonderful variety. [Illustration]\n\nJacques Paganel proceeded from admiration to ecstasy.", "similarity": 0.4360347092151642}, {"chunk_id": 57, "text": "\"Perhaps,\" replied the Patagonian. As soon as this word was translated, Thalcave was surrounded by the\nseven travelers, who gazed at him with questioning looks. Paganel,\nexcited and scarcely finding his words, resumed these interesting\ninterrogatories, while his eyes, fixed upon the grave Indian, strove\nto anticipate his reply before it issued from his lips. Every word the\nPatagonian said he repeated in English, so that his companions heard\nthe Indian speak, as it were, in their own language. \"And this prisoner?\" inquired Paganel. \"He was a stranger,\" replied Thalcave slowly; \"a European.\" \"You have seen him?\" \"No, but he is mentioned in the accounts of the Indians. He was a brave\nman.\" \"You understand, my friends,\" said Paganel; \"a courageous man!\" \"My father!\" cried Robert Grant. Then, addressing Paganel:\n\n\"How do you say 'It is my father,' in Spanish?\" he asked. \"_Es mio padre_,\" answered the geographer. Immediately Robert, taking Thalcave's hands, said in a sweet voice,--\n\n\"_Es mio padre!_\"\n\n\"_Suo padre!_\" replied the Patagonian, whose look brightened. He took the boy in his arms, lifted him from his horse, and gazed at\nhim with the most curious sympathy. His intelligent countenance became\nsuffused with a peaceful emotion. But Paganel had not finished his inquiries. Where was this prisoner? What was he doing? When had Thalcave heard of him? All these questions\nthronged his mind at once. He did not have to wait long for answers,\nbut learnt that the European was a slave of one of the Indian tribes\nthat scour the plains. \"But where was he last?\" asked Paganel. \"With the cazique Calfoucoura,\" answered Thalcave. \"On the line we have been following?\" \"Yes.\" \"And who is this cazique?\" \"The chief of the Poyuches Indians; a man with two tongues and two\nhearts.\" [Sidenote: A SCIENTIFIC BATH.] \"That is to say, false in word and in deed,\" said Paganel, after\ntranslating to his companions this beautiful metaphor of the Indian\nlanguage. \"And can we rescue our friend?\" he added. \"Perhaps so, if your friend is still in the hands of the Indians.\" \"And when did you hear of him?\" \"A long time ago, and, since then, the sun has brought back two summers\nto the sky.\" Glenarvan's joy could not be described. This answer coincided exactly\nwith the date of the document. But one question remained to be asked. \"You speak of a prisoner,\" said Paganel; \"but were there not three?\" \"I do not know,\" replied Thalcave. \"And you know nothing of their actual situation?\" \"Nothing.\" This last word ended the conversation. It was possible that the three\nprisoners had been separated a long time. But the substance of the\nPatagonian's information was that the Indians spoke of a European who\nhad fallen into their power. The date of his captivity, the place where\nhe must have been, everything, even to the Patagonian phrase used to\nexpress his courage, related evidently to Captain Harry Grant. Their progress was now somewhat slow and difficult; their next object\nbeing to reach and cross the river Colorado, to which at length\ntheir horses brought them. Here Paganel's first care was to bathe\n\"geographically\" in its waters, which are colored by a reddish clay. He\nwas surprised to find the depth so great as it really was, this being\nthe result of the snow having melted rapidly under the first heat of\nsummer.", "similarity": 0.40714946389198303}]}

But was Jacques Paganel to die a bachelor? Certainly not; for, after\nhis heroic exploits, the worthy geographer could not escape celebrity. His eccentricities (and his abilities) made him much talked of in\nScotland. People seemed as though they could not show him enough\nattention. Just at this time an amiable lady of thirty, none other than the\nmajor's cousin, a little eccentric herself, but still agreeable and\ncharming, fell in love with the geographer's peculiarities. Paganel was\nfar from being insensible to Miss Arabella's attractions, yet did not\ndare to declare his sentiments. The major accordingly undertook the\npart of Cupid's messenger between these two congenial hearts, and even\ntold Paganel that marriage was \"the last blunder\" that he could commit. But the geographer was very much embarrassed, and, strangely enough,\ncould not summon courage to speak for himself. [Illustration: Early in the afternoon the travelers reached Malcolm\nCastle, amidst the hurrahs of their tenantry and friends.] \"Does not Miss Arabella please you?\" MacNabb would say to him. \"Oh, major, she is charming!\" cried Paganel,--\"a thousand times too\ncharming for me; and, if I must tell you, would please me better if she\nwere less so. I should like to find a defect.\" \"Be easy,\" answered the major; \"she has more than one. The most perfect\nwoman always has her share. Well, then, Paganel, are you decided?\" \"I do not dare.\" \"But, my learned friend, why do you hesitate?\" \"I am unworthy of her!\" was the geographer's invariable reply. At last, one day, driven desperate by the irrepressible major, Paganel\nconfessed to him, under the pledge of secrecy, a peculiarity that would\nfacilitate his identification, if the police should ever be on his\ntrack! \"Bah!\" exclaimed the major. \"It is as I tell you,\" persisted Paganel. \"What matter, my worthy friend?\" \"Is that your opinion?\" \"On the contrary, you are only more remarkable. This adds to your\npersonal advantages. It makes you the inimitable individual of whom\nArabella has dreamed.\" And the major, preserving an imperturbable gravity, left Paganel a prey\nto the most acute anxiety. A short interview took place between MacNabb and the lady, and fifteen\nweeks after a marriage was celebrated with great pomp in the chapel of\nMalcolm Castle. [Illustration: Fifteen weeks after a marriage was celebrated with great\npomp in the chapel of Malcolm Castle.] The geographer's secret would doubtless have remained forever\nburied in the abysses of the unknown if the major had not told it to\nGlenarvan, who did not conceal it from Lady Helena, who communicated\nit to Mrs. Mangles.

Manuel did not think of any other calling than that of the\nsoldier, and hoped, in time, with the help of God, to offer to the\nrepublic a whole battalion of young soldiers. \"You have seen them?\" said he. \"Charming fellows! Good soldiers! José! Juan! Miguel! Pepe! Pepe is only seven years old, and is already biting\nhis cartridge!\" Pepe, hearing himself complimented, joined his two little feet, and\npresented arms with perfect precision. \"He will do!\" added the sergeant. \"He will be a major--or\nbrigadier-general one day!\" This story lasted a quarter of an hour, to Thalcave's great\nastonishment. The Indian could not understand how so many words could\ncome from a single throat. No one interrupted the commander; and even\na French sergeant had to conclude at last, though not without forcing\nhis guests to accompany him to his dwelling. Here they were introduced\nto Madame Ipharaguerre, who appeared to be \"a good-looking person,\" if\nthis expression may be employed in regard to an Indian. When he had exhausted himself, the sergeant asked his guests to what he\nowed the honor of their visit. And now it was their turn to explain. Paganel, opening the conversation in French, told him of their journey\nacross the Pampas, and ended by asking why the Indians had abandoned\nthe country. \"War!\" replied the sergeant. \"War?\" \"Yes, civil war.\" \"Civil war?\" rejoined Paganel. \"Yes, war between Paraguay and Buenos Ayres,\" answered the sergeant. \"Well?\" \"Why, all the Indians of the north are in the rear of General Flores,\nand those of the plains are plundering.\" \"But the caziques?\" \"The caziques with them.\" This answer was reported to Thalcave, who shook his head. Indeed,\nhe either did not know, or had forgotten, that a civil war, which\nwas afterwards to involve Brazil, was decimating two-thirds of the\nrepublic. The Indians had everything to gain in these internal\nstruggles, and could not neglect such fine opportunities for plunder. The sergeant, therefore, was not mistaken in attributing this desertion\nof the Pampas to the civil war that was being waged in the northern\npart of the Argentine Provinces. But this event disconcerted Glenarvan's hopes. If Captain Grant was\na prisoner of the caziques, he must have been carried by them to the\nnorthern frontiers. Yet how and where to find him? Must they attempt\na perilous and almost useless search to the northern limits of the\nPampas? It was a serious matter, which was to be earnestly considered. However, one important question was still to be asked of the sergeant,\nand the major thought of this, while his companions were looking at\neach other in silence. \"Have you heard of any Europeans being retained as prisoners by the\ncaziques of the Pampas?\" Manuel reflected for a few moments, like a man who recalls events to\nrecollection. \"Yes,\" said he, at length. \"Ah!\" cried Glenarvan, conceiving a new hope.

Paganel, opening the conversation in French, told him of their journey\nacross the Pampas, and ended by asking why the Indians had abandoned\nthe country. \"War!\" replied the sergeant. \"War?\" \"Yes, civil war.\" \"Civil war?\" rejoined Paganel. \"Yes, war between Paraguay and Buenos Ayres,\" answered the sergeant. \"Well?\" \"Why, all the Indians of the north are in the rear of General Flores,\nand those of the plains are plundering.\" \"But the caziques?\" \"The caziques with them.\" This answer was reported to Thalcave, who shook his head. Indeed,\nhe either did not know, or had forgotten, that a civil war, which\nwas afterwards to involve Brazil, was decimating two-thirds of the\nrepublic. The Indians had everything to gain in these internal\nstruggles, and could not neglect such fine opportunities for plunder. The sergeant, therefore, was not mistaken in attributing this desertion\nof the Pampas to the civil war that was being waged in the northern\npart of the Argentine Provinces. But this event disconcerted Glenarvan's hopes. If Captain Grant was\na prisoner of the caziques, he must have been carried by them to the\nnorthern frontiers. Yet how and where to find him? Must they attempt\na perilous and almost useless search to the northern limits of the\nPampas? It was a serious matter, which was to be earnestly considered. However, one important question was still to be asked of the sergeant,\nand the major thought of this, while his companions were looking at\neach other in silence. \"Have you heard of any Europeans being retained as prisoners by the\ncaziques of the Pampas?\" Manuel reflected for a few moments, like a man who recalls events to\nrecollection. \"Yes,\" said he, at length. \"Ah!\" cried Glenarvan, conceiving a new hope. [Sidenote: REVELATIONS.] Paganel, MacNabb, Robert, and he now surrounded the sergeant. \"Speak, speak!\" cried they, gazing at him with eagerness even in their\nlooks. \"Several years ago,\" replied Manuel, \"yes,--that is it,--European\nprisoners--but have never seen them.\" \"Several years ago?\" said Glenarvan. \"You are mistaken.

I speak two\nlanguages instead of one.\" \"By my faith, I should not have thought of that,\" replied MacNabb. \"My\ncompliments, Paganel, my sincere compliments!\" [Sidenote: TABLE-TALK IN THE SOUTH ATLANTIC.] Paganel was applauded, but did not lose a single mouthful. He did not,\nhowever, notice one peculiarity observed by Glenarvan, and that was the\nyoung captain's attentions to his neighbor, Mary Grant. A slight sign\nfrom Lady Helena to her husband told him how matters stood. He gazed at\nthe two young people with affectionate sympathy, and finally addressed\nthe captain, but upon a different subject. \"How did you succeed with your voyage, captain?\" he inquired. \"Excellently,\" replied the captain; \"only I must inform your lordship\nthat we did not return by way of the Strait of Magellan.\" \"What!\" cried Paganel, \"you doubled Cape Horn, and I was not there!\" \"Hang yourself!\" said the major. \"Selfish fellow! you give me this advice in order that you may share my\nrope!\" retorted the geographer. \"Well, my dear Paganel,\" added Glenarvan, \"unless we are endowed with\nubiquity, we cannot be everywhere. Since you crossed the Pampas, you\ncould not at the same time double Cape Horn.\" \"Nevertheless, I am sorry,\" replied the geographer. Captain Mangles now told the story of his voyage, and was congratulated\nby Glenarvan, who, addressing Mary Grant, said,--\n\n\"My dear young lady, I see that Captain John pays his homage to your\nnoble qualities, and I am happy to find that you are not displeased\nwith his ship.\" \"Oh, how could I be?\" replied Mary, gazing at Lady Helena, and perhaps\nalso at the young captain. \"My sister loves you, Mr. Captain,\" cried Robert, \"and I do too.\" \"And I return your love, my dear boy,\" replied Captain Mangles, a\nlittle confused by Robert's words, which also brought a slight blush to\nthe face of the young girl. Then, changing the conversation to a less embarrassing subject, the\ncaptain added,--\n\n\"Since I have related the Duncan's voyage, will not your lordship give\nus a few particulars of your travels, and the exploits of our young\nhero?\" No recital could have been more agreeable to Lady Helena and Miss\nGrant, and Glenarvan hastened to satisfy their curiosity. He told, word\nfor word, all about their journey from ocean to ocean. The passage\nof the Andes, the earthquake, Robert's disappearance, his capture by\nthe condor, Thalcave's fortunate shot, the adventure with the wolves,\nthe boy's devotion, the meeting with Sergeant Manuel, the inundation,\ntheir refuge in the tree, the lightning, the fire, the alligators,\nthe water-spout, the night on the shores of the Atlantic, all these\nincidents, cheerful or serious, excited alternately the joy and terror\nof his hearers. Many a circumstance was related that brought Robert\nthe caresses of his sister and Lady Helena. Never was boy more highly\npraised, or by more enthusiastic friends. \"Now, my friends,\" remarked Lord Glenarvan, when he had finished his\nrecital, \"let us think of the present. Let us return to the subject of\nCaptain Grant.\" When breakfast was over, the party repaired to Lady Helena's\nstate-room, and, taking seats around a table loaded with maps and\ncharts, resumed the conversation.", "similarity": 0.492257297039032}, {"chunk_id": 52, "text": "to start for India and arrive at Chili! to learn Spanish and speak Portuguese! this is too much, and, if it\ncontinues, I shall some day throw myself out of the window instead of\nmy cigar.\" To hear Paganel take his blunder thus, to see his comical actions, it\nwas impossible to keep serious. Besides, he set the example himself. \"Laugh, my friends,\" said he, \"laugh with a will! you cannot laugh as\nmuch as I do at myself.\" And he uttered the most formidable peal of laughter that ever issued\nfrom the mouth of a geographer. \"But we are none the less without an interpreter,\" said the major. \"Oh, do not be troubled,\" replied Paganel. \"The Portuguese and Spanish\nresemble each other so much that I made a mistake. However, this very\nresemblance will soon enable me to rectify my error, and in a short\ntime I will thank this worthy Patagonian in the language he speaks so\nwell.\" Paganel was right, for he could soon exchange a few words with the\nnative. He even learned that his name was Thalcave, a word which\nsignifies in Araucanian \"the thunderer.\" This surname was doubtless\ngiven to him for his skill in the use of fire-arms. [Sidenote: BETTER PROSPECTS.] But Glenarvan was particularly rejoiced to discover that the Patagonian\nwas a guide, and, moreover, a guide of the Pampas. There was,\ntherefore, something so providential in this meeting that the success\nof the enterprise seemed already an accomplished fact, and no one any\nlonger doubted the rescue of Captain Grant. In the meantime the travelers and the Patagonian had returned to\nRobert. The latter stretched his arms towards the native, who, without\na word, placed his hand upon his head. He examined the child and felt\nhis wounded limbs. Then, smiling, he went and gathered on the banks\nof the stream a few handfuls of wild celery, with which he rubbed the\nboy's body. Under this treatment, performed with an extreme gentleness,\nthe child felt his strength revive, and it was plain that a few hours\nwould suffice to restore him. It was therefore decided that that day and the following night should\nbe passed at the encampment. Besides, two important questions remained\nto be settled--food, and means of conveyance. Provisions and mules were\nboth wanting. Fortunately Thalcave solved the difficulty. This guide, who was\naccustomed to conduct travelers along the Patagonian frontiers, and\nwas one of the most intelligent baqueanos of the country, engaged to\nfurnish Glenarvan all that his little party needed. He offered to take\nhim to a \"tolderia\" (encampment) of Indians, about four miles distant,\nwhere they would find everything necessary for the expedition. This\nproposal was made partly by gestures, partly by Spanish words which\nPaganel succeeded in understanding. It was accepted, and Glenarvan and\nhis learned friend, taking leave of their companions, reascended the\nstream under the guidance of the Patagonian. They proceeded at a good pace for an hour and a half, taking long\nstrides to keep up to the giant Thalcave. All the region was charming,\nand of a rich fertility. The grassy pastures succeeded each other,\nand could easily have fed thousands of cattle. Large ponds, united by\na winding chain of streams, gave these plains a verdant moisture. Black-headed swans sported on the mirror-like surface, and disputed the\nempire of the waters with numberless ostriches that gamboled over the\nplains, while the brilliant feathered tribes were in wonderful variety. [Illustration]\n\nJacques Paganel proceeded from admiration to ecstasy.", "similarity": 0.5261027812957764}, {"chunk_id": 57, "text": "\"Perhaps,\" replied the Patagonian. As soon as this word was translated, Thalcave was surrounded by the\nseven travelers, who gazed at him with questioning looks. Paganel,\nexcited and scarcely finding his words, resumed these interesting\ninterrogatories, while his eyes, fixed upon the grave Indian, strove\nto anticipate his reply before it issued from his lips. Every word the\nPatagonian said he repeated in English, so that his companions heard\nthe Indian speak, as it were, in their own language. \"And this prisoner?\" inquired Paganel. \"He was a stranger,\" replied Thalcave slowly; \"a European.\" \"You have seen him?\" \"No, but he is mentioned in the accounts of the Indians. He was a brave\nman.\" \"You understand, my friends,\" said Paganel; \"a courageous man!\" \"My father!\" cried Robert Grant. Then, addressing Paganel:\n\n\"How do you say 'It is my father,' in Spanish?\" he asked. \"_Es mio padre_,\" answered the geographer. Immediately Robert, taking Thalcave's hands, said in a sweet voice,--\n\n\"_Es mio padre!_\"\n\n\"_Suo padre!_\" replied the Patagonian, whose look brightened. He took the boy in his arms, lifted him from his horse, and gazed at\nhim with the most curious sympathy. His intelligent countenance became\nsuffused with a peaceful emotion. But Paganel had not finished his inquiries. Where was this prisoner? What was he doing? When had Thalcave heard of him? All these questions\nthronged his mind at once. He did not have to wait long for answers,\nbut learnt that the European was a slave of one of the Indian tribes\nthat scour the plains. \"But where was he last?\" asked Paganel. \"With the cazique Calfoucoura,\" answered Thalcave. \"On the line we have been following?\" \"Yes.\" \"And who is this cazique?\" \"The chief of the Poyuches Indians; a man with two tongues and two\nhearts.\" [Sidenote: A SCIENTIFIC BATH.] \"That is to say, false in word and in deed,\" said Paganel, after\ntranslating to his companions this beautiful metaphor of the Indian\nlanguage. \"And can we rescue our friend?\" he added. \"Perhaps so, if your friend is still in the hands of the Indians.\" \"And when did you hear of him?\" \"A long time ago, and, since then, the sun has brought back two summers\nto the sky.\" Glenarvan's joy could not be described. This answer coincided exactly\nwith the date of the document. But one question remained to be asked. \"You speak of a prisoner,\" said Paganel; \"but were there not three?\" \"I do not know,\" replied Thalcave. \"And you know nothing of their actual situation?\" \"Nothing.\" This last word ended the conversation. It was possible that the three\nprisoners had been separated a long time. But the substance of the\nPatagonian's information was that the Indians spoke of a European who\nhad fallen into their power. The date of his captivity, the place where\nhe must have been, everything, even to the Patagonian phrase used to\nexpress his courage, related evidently to Captain Harry Grant. Their progress was now somewhat slow and difficult; their next object\nbeing to reach and cross the river Colorado, to which at length\ntheir horses brought them. Here Paganel's first care was to bathe\n\"geographically\" in its waters, which are colored by a reddish clay. He\nwas surprised to find the depth so great as it really was, this being\nthe result of the snow having melted rapidly under the first heat of\nsummer.", "similarity": 0.4987715184688568}]}

CHAPTER XLIII. HELPLESS AND HOPELESS. It was not the time to despair, but to act. If Kemple Pier bridge was\ndestroyed, they must cross the Snowy at all events, and reach Twofold\nBay before Ben Joyce's band. They lost no time, therefore, in vain\nwords; but the next day Captain Mangles and Glenarvan went to examine\nthe river, preparatory to a passage. The tumultuous waters, swollen by the rains, had not subsided. They\nwhirled along with indescribable fury. It was certain death to brave\nthis torrent. Glenarvan, with folded arms and lowered head, stood\nmotionless. \"Do you wish me to try to swim to the opposite bank?\" asked Captain\nMangles. \"No, John,\" replied Glenarvan, seizing the bold young man by the hand;\n\"let us wait.\" They both returned to the encampment. The day was passed in the most\nlively anxiety. Ten times did Glenarvan return to the river. He sought\nto contrive some bold plan of crossing it, but in vain. It would not\nhave been more impassable if a torrent of lava had flowed between its\nbanks. During these long hours of delay, Lady Helena, with the major's\nassistance, bestowed upon Mulready the most skillful care. The sailor\nfelt that he was returning to life. MacNabb ventured to affirm that no\nvital organ had been injured, the loss of blood sufficiently explained\nthe patient's weakness. Thus, as soon as his wound was healed and the\nhemorrhage stopped, only time and rest were needed for his complete\nrestoration. Lady Helena had insisted upon his occupying her end of the\ncart. Mulready felt greatly honored. His greatest anxiety was in the\nthought that his condition might delay Glenarvan, and he forced them to\npromise that they would leave him at the camp in charge of Wilson, as\nsoon as the river became fordable. Unfortunately, this was not possible, either that day or the next. At\nseeing himself thus detained, Glenarvan despaired. Lady Helena and the\nmajor tried in vain to pacify and exhort him to patience. Patience! when, at that moment perhaps, Ben Joyce was going on board the yacht,\nwhen the Duncan was weighing anchor and steaming towards that fatal\ncoast, to which every hour brought her nearer! [Sidenote: ALMOST DESPAIRING.] Captain Mangles felt at heart all Glenarvan's anguish, and, as he\nwished to overcome the difficulty at all hazards, he constructed a\ncanoe in the Australian fashion, with large pieces of the bark of the\ngum-trees. These slabs, which were very light, were held together by\nwooden cross-bars, and formed a very frail craft. The captain and the sailor tried the canoe. All that skill, strength,\nor courage could do they did. But scarcely were they in the current,\nwhen they capsized and narrowly escaped with their lives. The boat was\ndrawn into the eddies and disappeared. Captain Mangles and Wilson had\nnot advanced ten yards into the river, which was swollen by the rains\nand melting snows till it was now a mile in breadth. Two days were wasted in this way. The major and Glenarvan went five\nmiles up stream without finding a practicable ford. Everywhere was the\nsame impetuosity, the same tumultuous rush of water; all the southern\nslopes of the mountains had poured their liquid torrents into this\nsingle stream. They were forced, therefore, to give up any hope of\nsaving the Duncan. Five days had passed since Ben Joyce's departure,\nthe yacht was probably that very moment at the coast, in the hands of\nthe convicts. However, this state of things could not last long.", "similarity": 0.5137561559677124}, {"chunk_id": 216, "text": "Paganel wondered whether he should\nconsider himself a prisoner; but seeing that he could not take a step\nwithout being graciously accompanied by the chief, he soon knew how\nmatters stood on this point. The chief, whose name was \"Hihy\" (sunbeam), was not a bad man. The\nspectacles and telescope gave him a high opinion of Paganel, whom he\nattached carefully to his person, not only by his benefits, but by\nstrong flaxen ropes, especially at night. This novel situation lasted three long days. Was he well or badly\ntreated? Both, as he stated without further explanation. In short, he\nwas a prisoner, and, except for the prospect of immediate torture,\nhis condition did not seem more enviable than that of his unfortunate\nfriends. Fortunately, last night he succeeded in biting asunder his ropes and\nescaping. He had witnessed at a distance the burial of the chief,\nknew that he had been interred on the summit of Maunganamu mountain,\nand that it was tabooed in consequence. He therefore resolved to take\nrefuge there, not wishing to leave the place where his companions were\nheld captives. He succeeded in his undertaking, arrived at Kara-Tété's\ntomb, and waited in hope that Providence would in some way deliver his\nfriends. Such was Paganel's story. Did he omit designedly any circumstance\nof his stay among the natives? More than once his embarrassment led\nthem to suspect so. However that might be, he received unanimous\ncongratulations; and as the past was now known, they returned to the\npresent. Their situation was still exceedingly critical. The natives, if they\ndid not venture to climb the mountain, expected that hunger and thirst\nwould force their prisoners to surrender. It was only a matter of time,\nand the savages had great patience. Glenarvan did not disregard the\ndifficulties of his position, but waited for the favorable issue which\nProvidence seemed to promise. And first he wished to examine this improvised fortress; not to defend\nit, for an attack was not to be feared, but that he might find a way of\nescaping. The major and the captain, Robert, Paganel, and himself, took\nthe exact bearings of the mountain. They observed the direction of the\npaths, their branches and declivities. A ridge a mile in length united\nthe Maunganamu to the Wahiti range, and then declined to the plain. Its\nnarrow and winding summit presented the only practicable route, in case\nescape should become possible. If the fugitives could pass this point\nunperceived, under cover of the night, perhaps they might succeed in\nreaching the deep valleys and outwitting the Maoris. But this course offered more than one danger, as they would have to\npass below within gun-shot. The bullets of the natives on the lower\nramparts of the pah might intercept them, and form a barrier that no\none could safely cross. Glenarvan and his friends, as soon as they ventured on the dangerous\npart of the ridge, were saluted with a volley of shots; but only a\nfew wads, borne by the wind, reached them. They were made of printed\npaper. Paganel picked them up out of curiosity, but it was difficult to\ndecipher them. [Sidenote: A STRANGE COLPORTEUR.] \"Why!\" said he, \"do you know, my friends, what these creatures use for\nwads in their guns?\" \"No,\" replied Glenarvan. \"Leaves of the Bible!

Each looked to the geographer, who beat his brow in despair. \"Ah! I understand,\" said he, at last. \"All is clear, all is explained.\" \"But what is to be done?\" asked Glenarvan, with as much anxiety as\nimpatience. \"My friends,\" answered Paganel, taking Robert's hands, \"we must submit\nto a severe misfortune.

While thinking that we were on the track of Captain\nGrant, we have fallen upon that of young Guinnard.\" A profound silence followed this declaration. The mistake was palpable. The sergeant's story, the nationality of the prisoner, the murder\nof his companion, and his escape from the hands of the Indians, all\naccorded with the evident facts. Glenarvan gazed at Thalcave with a\nbewildered air. The Indian then resumed the conversation. \"Have you never heard of three English captives?\" he asked the sergeant. \"Never,\" replied Manuel. \"It would have been known at Tandil. I should\nhave heard of it. No, it cannot be.\" Glenarvan, after this formal response, had nothing more to do at Fort\nIndependence. He and his friends, therefore, departed, not without\nthanking the sergeant and shaking hands with him. Glenarvan was in despair at this complete overthrow of his hopes. Robert walked beside him in silence, with tearful eyes, while his\nprotector could not find a single word to console him. Paganel\ngesticulated and talked to himself. The major did not open his lips. As for Thalcave, his Indian pride seemed humbled at having gone astray\non a false trail. No one, however, thought of reproaching him for so\nexcusable an error. They returned to the encampment, saddened indeed. Still, not one of\nthe courageous and devoted men regretted so many hardships uselessly\nendured, so many dangers vainly incurred. But each saw all hope of\nsuccess annihilated in an instant. Could they find Captain Grant\nbetween Tandil and the sea? No. If any prisoner had fallen into the\nhands of the Indians on the Atlantic coast, Sergeant Manuel would\ncertainly have been informed. An event of such a nature could not\nhave escaped the natives who trade from Tandil to Carmen. Among the\ntraders of the Argentine Plains everything is known and reported. There\nwas therefore but one course now to take,--to join, without delay, the\nDuncan at Cape Medano, the appointed rendezvous.

The major took the book, and looked at it. \"Well, what work is this?\" he asked. \"The Lusiad,\" replied Paganel; \"an admirable poem which----\"\n\n\"The Lusiad!\" cried Glenarvan. \"Yes, my friend, the Lusiad of the immortal Camoëns, nothing more or\nless.\" \"Camoëns!\" repeated Glenarvan; \"but, unfortunate friend, Camoëns was\na Portuguese! It is Portuguese that you have been studying for six\nweeks.\" \"Camoëns! Lusiad! Portuguese!\" Paganel could say no more. His eyes wandered, while a peal of Homeric\nlaughter rang in his ears. The Patagonian did not wink; he waited patiently for the explanation of\nthis event, which was totally incomprehensible to him. \"Insensate! fool!\" cried Paganel, at last. \"What! is it so?

The chief, whose name was \"Hihy\" (sunbeam), was not a bad man. The\nspectacles and telescope gave him a high opinion of Paganel, whom he\nattached carefully to his person, not only by his benefits, but by\nstrong flaxen ropes, especially at night. This novel situation lasted three long days. Was he well or badly\ntreated? Both, as he stated without further explanation. In short, he\nwas a prisoner, and, except for the prospect of immediate torture,\nhis condition did not seem more enviable than that of his unfortunate\nfriends. Fortunately, last night he succeeded in biting asunder his ropes and\nescaping. He had witnessed at a distance the burial of the chief,\nknew that he had been interred on the summit of Maunganamu mountain,\nand that it was tabooed in consequence. He therefore resolved to take\nrefuge there, not wishing to leave the place where his companions were\nheld captives. He succeeded in his undertaking, arrived at Kara-Tété's\ntomb, and waited in hope that Providence would in some way deliver his\nfriends. Such was Paganel's story. Did he omit designedly any circumstance\nof his stay among the natives? More than once his embarrassment led\nthem to suspect so. However that might be, he received unanimous\ncongratulations; and as the past was now known, they returned to the\npresent. Their situation was still exceedingly critical. The natives, if they\ndid not venture to climb the mountain, expected that hunger and thirst\nwould force their prisoners to surrender. It was only a matter of time,\nand the savages had great patience. Glenarvan did not disregard the\ndifficulties of his position, but waited for the favorable issue which\nProvidence seemed to promise. And first he wished to examine this improvised fortress; not to defend\nit, for an attack was not to be feared, but that he might find a way of\nescaping. The major and the captain, Robert, Paganel, and himself, took\nthe exact bearings of the mountain. They observed the direction of the\npaths, their branches and declivities. A ridge a mile in length united\nthe Maunganamu to the Wahiti range, and then declined to the plain. Its\nnarrow and winding summit presented the only practicable route, in case\nescape should become possible. If the fugitives could pass this point\nunperceived, under cover of the night, perhaps they might succeed in\nreaching the deep valleys and outwitting the Maoris. But this course offered more than one danger, as they would have to\npass below within gun-shot. The bullets of the natives on the lower\nramparts of the pah might intercept them, and form a barrier that no\none could safely cross. Glenarvan and his friends, as soon as they ventured on the dangerous\npart of the ridge, were saluted with a volley of shots; but only a\nfew wads, borne by the wind, reached them. They were made of printed\npaper. Paganel picked them up out of curiosity, but it was difficult to\ndecipher them. [Sidenote: A STRANGE COLPORTEUR.] \"Why!\" said he, \"do you know, my friends, what these creatures use for\nwads in their guns?\" \"No,\" replied Glenarvan. \"Leaves of the Bible! If this is the use they make of the sacred\nwritings, I pity the missionaries. They will have difficulty in\nfounding Maori libraries.\" \"And what passage of the Scriptures have these natives fired at us?\" asked Glenarvan.", "similarity": 0.48120418190956116}, {"chunk_id": 78, "text": "Masses of vapor, generated by the high temperature\nof the preceding days, condensed into thick clouds and threatened to\ndissolve in showers of rain. Moreover, the proximity of the Atlantic,\nand the west wind, which here reigns supreme, rendered the climate of\nthis region peculiarly moist. However, for that day at least the heavy\nclouds did not break; and at evening the horses, after traveling forty\nmiles, halted on the edge of a deep \"cañada,\" an immense natural ditch\nfilled with water. A shelter was wanting, but the ponchos served for\ntents as well as clothing, and peaceful slumbers enwrapped all. The next day, as they progressed farther, the presence of subterranean\nstreams betrayed itself more noticeably, and moisture was seen in every\ndepression of the ground. Soon they came to large ponds, some already\ndeep and others just forming. So long as there were only lagoons, the\nhorses could easily extricate themselves; but with these treacherous\nswamps it was more difficult. Tall grass obstructed them, and it was\nnecessary to incur the danger before it could be understood. These\nquagmires had been already fatal to more than one human being. Robert, who had ridden half a mile in advance, returned at a gallop,\ncrying,--\n\n\"Monsieur Paganel! Monsieur Paganel! A forest of horns!\" \"What!\" replied the geographer, \"have you found a forest of horns?\" \"Yes, yes; or at least a field.\" \"A field! you are dreaming, my boy,\" said Paganel, shrugging his\nshoulders. \"I am not dreaming,\" retorted Robert; \"you shall see for yourself. This\nis a strange country! People sow horns, and they spring up like corn! I\nshould like very well to have some of the seed.\" \"But he speaks seriously,\" said the major. \"Yes, major, you shall see.\" Robert was not mistaken, and soon they found themselves before a vast\nfield of horns, regularly planted. \"Well?\" said Robert. \"This is something singular,\" replied Paganel, turning towards the\nIndian with a questioning look. [Sidenote: AN ANXIOUS INDIAN.] \"The horns come from the ground,\" explained Thalcave; \"and the cattle\nare under it.\" \"What!\" cried Paganel, \"is there a whole drove in this mire?\" \"Yes,\" answered the Patagonian. In fact, a vast herd had perished in this bog, which had given way\nbeneath them. Hundreds of cattle had thus met their death, side by\nside, by suffocation in this vast quagmire. This circumstance, which\nsometimes takes place on the plains, could not be ignored by the\nIndian, and it was a warning which it was proper to heed. They passed\naround this immense hecatomb, which would have satisfied the most\nexacting gods of antiquity; and an hour after the field of horns was\nfar behind. Thalcave now began to observe with an anxious air the state of things\naround him. He frequently stopped, and rose in his stirrups. His tall\nform enabled him to survey a wide range; but, perceiving nothing that\ncould enlighten him, he resumed his undeviating course. A mile farther,\nhe stopped again, and, turning from the beaten track, proceeded a short\ndistance, first to the north, then to the south, and then resumed his\nplace at the head of the party, without saying either what he hoped or\nwhat he feared. These manoeuvres, many times repeated, puzzled Paganel and annoyed\nGlenarvan. The geographer was accordingly requested to interrogate\nthe Indian, which he did at once. Thalcave replied that he was\nastonished to see the plain so soaked with moisture. Never within his\nrecollection, since he had performed the office of guide, had his feet\ntrodden a soil so saturated.", "similarity": 0.4503403902053833}, {"chunk_id": 199, "text": "Paganel, addressing Captain Mangles in French, so as not to be\nunderstood by the savages, asked him how fast the canoe was going. The\ncaptain thought about three miles an hour. \"Then,\" replied the geographer, \"if we do not travel during the night,\nour voyage to the lake will last about four days.\" \"But whereabouts are the English garrisons?\" asked Glenarvan. \"It is difficult to say,\" replied Paganel. \"At all events, the war\nmust have reached the province of Taranaki, and probably the troops\nare collected beyond the mountains, on the side of the lake where the\nhabitations of the savages are concentrated.\" \"God grant it!\" said Lady Helena. Glenarvan cast a sorrowful glance at his young wife and Mary Grant,\nexposed to the mercy of these fierce natives, and captives in a wild\ncountry, far from all human assistance. But he saw that he was watched\nby Kai-Koumou, and, not wishing to show that one of the captives was\nhis wife, he prudently kept his thoughts to himself, and gazed at the\nbanks of the river with apparent indifference. [Sidenote: ACCESSIONS, AND PROGRESS.] The sun was just sinking below the horizon as the canoe ran upon a bank\nof pumice-stones, which the Waikato carries with it from its source\nin the volcanic mountains. Several trees grew here, as if designed to\nshelter an encampment. Kai-Koumou landed his prisoners. The men had their hands tied, the ladies were free. All were placed\nin the centre of the encampment, around which large fires formed an\nimpassable barrier. Before Kai-Koumou had informed his captives of his intention to\nexchange them, Glenarvan and Captain Mangles had discussed various\nmethods of recovering their liberty. What they could not venture in the\nboat they hoped to attempt on land, at the hour for encamping, under\ncover of the night. But since Glenarvan's conversation with the chief, it seemed wise to\nabandon this design. They must be patient. It was the most prudent\nplan. The exchange offered chances that neither an open attack nor a\nflight across these unknown regions could afford. Many circumstances\nmight indeed arise that would delay, and even prevent, such a\ntransaction; but still it was better to await the result. What,\nmoreover, could ten defenceless men do against thirty well-armed\nsavages? Besides, Glenarvan thought it likely that Kai-Koumou's tribe\nhad lost some chief of high rank whom they were particularly anxious to\nrecover; and he was not mistaken. The next day the canoe ascended the river with increased swiftness. It stopped for a moment at the junction of a small river which wound\nacross the plains on the right bank. Here another canoe, with ten\nnatives on board, joined Kai-Koumou. The warriors merely exchanged\nsalutations, and then continued their course. The new-comers had\nrecently fought against the English troops, as could be seen by their\ntattered garments, their gory weapons, and the wounds that still bled\nbeneath their rags. They were gloomy and taciturn, and, with the\nindifference common to all savage races, paid no attention to the\ncaptives. Towards evening Kai-Koumou landed at the foot of the mountains,\nwhose nearer ridges reached precipitously to the river-bank. Here\ntwenty natives, who had disembarked from their canoes, were making\npreparations for the night. Fires blazed beneath the trees. A chief,\nequal in rank to Kai-Koumou, advanced with measured pace, and, rubbing\nhis nose against that of the latter, saluted him cordially.", "similarity": 0.5059853792190552}]}

Their line of travel now struck\nthe dusty roads of the county of Dalhousie. Half the journey was\naccomplished. In fifteen days more of travel equally rapid the little\nparty would reach the shores of Twofold Bay. Moreover, every one was in\ngood health. Paganel's assertions as to the salubrity of this climate\nwere verified. There was little or no moisture, and the heat was quite\nendurable. Neither men nor animals complained.

The criminal disaster on the railway, when made known\nto Ayrton, had induced him to take precautions hitherto needless. The horsemen were not to lose sight of the cart. During the hours of\nencampment one of them was always on guard. Morning and evening the\npriming of the fire-arms was renewed. It was certain that a band of\nmalefactors were scouring the country; and, although nothing gave cause\nfor immediate suspicion, still it was necessary to be ready for any\nemergency. In truth they had reason to act thus. An imprudence, or negligence\neven, might cost them dear. Glenarvan, moreover, was not alone in\ngiving heed to this state of affairs. In the isolated towns and\nstations the inhabitants and squatters took precautions against any\nattack or surprise. The houses were closed at nightfall. The dogs were\nlet loose within the palisades, and barked at the slightest alarm. There was not a shepherd, collecting his numerous flocks on horseback\nfor the evening return, who did not carry a carbine suspended from the\npommel of his saddle. The news of the crime committed at Camden Bridge\nwas the reason for this excessive caution, and many a colonist who had\nformerly slept with open doors and windows now carefully locked his\nhouse at twilight.

It was \"_Il mio tesoro tanto_\"\nfrom Don Juan. [Illustration: Paganel did not lie down, but, rifle on shoulder,\nguarded the encampment, walking to and fro that he might the better\nresist sleep.] \"Parbleu!\" thought the geographer, \"however strange the Australian\nbirds may be, or even though the parrots were the most musical in the\nworld, they could not sing Mozart.\" He listened to the end of this grand inspiration of the master. The\neffect of this sweet melody, in the stillness of the starlit night,\nwas indescribable. He remained a long time under the influences of its\nenchantment. At last the voice ceased, and all was silent. When Wilson came to relieve the geographer, he found him wrapt in a\nprofound reverie. Paganel said nothing to the sailor, but, reserving\nhis account of the incident for Glenarvan the next day, he crept into\nthe tent. In the morning the whole party were awakened by unexpected bayings. Glenarvan at once arose. Two magnificent pointers were gamboling along\nthe edge of a small wood; but at the approach of the travelers they\ndisappeared among the trees, barking loudly. \"There must be a station in this desert,\" said Glenarvan, \"and hunters,\nsince those are hunting-dogs.\" Paganel was just about to relate his experiences of the past night,\nwhen two men appeared, in hunting costume, mounted on fine horses. They\nnaturally stopped at sight of the little party, encamped in gypsy-like\nfashion, and seemed to be wondering what the presence of armed men in\nthis place meant, when they perceived the ladies, who were alighting\nfrom the cart. They immediately dismounted, and advanced towards them, hat in hand. Glenarvan went to meet them, and introduced himself and party, giving\nthe name and rank of each member. The young men bowed, and one of them,\nthe elder, said:\n\n\"My lord, will your ladies, your companions, and yourself do us the\nhonor to accompany us to our house?\" \"May I ask, gentlemen, whom I have the honor of addressing?\" inquired\nGlenarvan. \"Michael and Alexander Patterson, proprietors of Hottam Station.

The horses had\nbeen confided to the care of Ayrton and the sailors, and the travelers\nat once betook themselves on foot to Hottam Station, under the guidance\nof the two young men.

I therefore think it wise to avoid this village,\nand likewise any meeting with the natives. Once at Drury, it will be\ndifferent, and there our courageous ladies can refresh themselves at\ntheir ease for the fatigues of their journey.\" The geographer's opinion prevailed. Lady Helena preferred to pass\nthe last night in the open air rather than to expose her companions. Neither she nor Mary Grant required a halt, and they therefore\ncontinued to follow the banks of the river. Two hours after, the first shadows of evening began to descend the\nmountains. The sun before disappearing below the western horizon had\nglinted a few rays through a rift in the clouds. The eastern peaks were\ncrimsoned with the last beams of day. Glenarvan and his friends hastened their pace. They knew the shortness\nof the twilight in this latitude, and how quickly night sets in. It\nwas important to reach the junction of the two rivers before it became\ndark. But a dense fog rose from the earth, and made it very difficult\nto distinguish the way. Fortunately, hearing availed in place of sight. Soon a distinct murmur\nof the waters indicated the union of the two streams in a common bed,\nand not long after the little party arrived at the point where the\nWaipa mingles with the Waikato in resounding cascades. \"Here is the Waikato,\" cried Paganel, \"and the road to Auckland runs\nalong its right bank.\" \"We shall see to-morrow,\" replied the major. \"Let us encamp here. It\nseems to me as if those deeper shadows yonder proceeded from a little\nthicket of trees that has grown here expressly to shelter us.

We have arrived here unseen; let us try to go away in the same\nmanner. Fortunately, this fog will render us invisible.\" The group of trees was reached, and each conformed to the geographer's\nrigorous regulations. The cold supper was noiselessly eaten, and soon a\nprofound sleep overcame the weary travelers. CHAPTER XLVIII. INTRODUCTION TO THE CANNIBALS. The next morning at break of day a dense fog was spreading heavily over\nthe river, but the rays of the sun were not long in piercing the mist,\nwhich rapidly disappeared under the influence of the radiant orb. The\nbanks of the stream were released from their shroud, and the course of\nthe Waikato appeared in all its morning beauty. A narrow tongue of land bristling with shrubbery ran out to a point\nat the junction of the two rivers. The waters of the Waipa, which\nflowed more swiftly, drove back those of the Waikato for a quarter of a\nmile before they mingled; but the calm power of the one soon overcame\nthe boisterous impetuosity of the other, and both glided peacefully\ntogether to the broad bosom of the Pacific. As the mist rose, a boat might have been seen ascending the Waikato. It\nwas a canoe seventy feet long and five broad. The lofty prow resembled\nthat of a Venetian gondola, and the whole had been fashioned out of the\ntrunk of a pine. A bed of dry fern covered the bottom. Eight oars at\nthe bow propelled it up the river, while a man at the stern guided it\nby means of a movable paddle.", "similarity": 0.5113592147827148}, {"chunk_id": 23, "text": "Lord Glenarvan,\nmoreover, knew perfectly whom he had met.

The Frenchman, mistaking the vessel, had embarked while the crew of\nthe Duncan were engaged in the ceremony at Saint Mungo. Everything was\nexplained. But what would the geographer say, when he learned the name\nand destination of the vessel on which he had taken passage? \"So, Monsieur Paganel,\" said Glenarvan, \"you have chosen Calcutta as\nyour centre of action?\" \"Yes, my lord. To see India is an idea that I have cherished all my\nlife.

Wood was\nwanting, it is true, but fortunately a scanty and dry moss clothed the\nrocks. An ample supply was taken, as well as of a plant whose roots\nwere quite combustible. This precious fuel was brought to the hut, and\npiled in the fire-place; but it was difficult to kindle the fire, and\nespecially to keep it burning. When the viands were prepared, each one drank several mouthfuls of\nhot coffee with delight. As for the dried meat, it appeared a little\nunsatisfactory, which provoked on the part of Paganel a remark as\nuseless as it was true. \"Indeed,\" said he, \"I must confess a llama-steak would not be bad just\nnow.\" \"What!\" cried the major, \"are you not content with our supper, Paganel?\" \"Enchanted, my good major; but I acknowledge a plate of venison would\nbe welcome.\" \"You are a sybarite,\" said MacNabb. \"I accept the title, major; but you yourself, whatever you may say,\nwould not be displeased with a beefsteak.\" \"Probably not.\" \"And if you were asked to take your post at the cannon, you would go\nwithout a word.\" \"Certainly: and, although it pleases you----\"\n\nHis companions had not heard any more, when distant and prolonged howls\nwere heard.

There were\nhundreds, perhaps thousands, of these animals. Were they wild beasts\nof the Pampas, or only llamas? The whole party had only time to throw\nthemselves to the earth, while this living whirlwind passed a few feet\nabove them. At this moment the report of a fire-arm was heard. The major had shot\nat a venture. He thought that a large animal fell a few paces from\nhim, while the whole herd, carried along by their resistless motion,\ndisappeared down the slopes illumined by the volcano. \"Ah, I have them!\" cried a voice, that of Paganel. \"What have you?\" asked Glenarvan. \"My glasses, to be sure!\" \"You are not wounded?\" \"No, a little kick,--but by what?\"", "similarity": 0.400505930185318}, {"chunk_id": 249, "text": "It was arranged that Robert should be a sailor,\nlike his father and brother-in-law, and that he should continue the\ncontemplated project of the former, under the munificent patronage of\nLord Glenarvan.

His eccentricities (and his abilities) made him much talked of in\nScotland. People seemed as though they could not show him enough\nattention. Just at this time an amiable lady of thirty, none other than the\nmajor's cousin, a little eccentric herself, but still agreeable and\ncharming, fell in love with the geographer's peculiarities. Paganel was\nfar from being insensible to Miss Arabella's attractions, yet did not\ndare to declare his sentiments. The major accordingly undertook the\npart of Cupid's messenger between these two congenial hearts, and even\ntold Paganel that marriage was \"the last blunder\" that he could commit. But the geographer was very much embarrassed, and, strangely enough,\ncould not summon courage to speak for himself. [Illustration: Early in the afternoon the travelers reached Malcolm\nCastle, amidst the hurrahs of their tenantry and friends.] \"Does not Miss Arabella please you?\" MacNabb would say to him. \"Oh, major, she is charming!\" cried Paganel,--\"a thousand times too\ncharming for me; and, if I must tell you, would please me better if she\nwere less so. I should like to find a defect.\" \"Be easy,\" answered the major; \"she has more than one. The most perfect\nwoman always has her share. Well, then, Paganel, are you decided?\" \"I do not dare.\" \"But, my learned friend, why do you hesitate?\" \"I am unworthy of her!\" was the geographer's invariable reply. At last, one day, driven desperate by the irrepressible major, Paganel\nconfessed to him, under the pledge of secrecy, a peculiarity that would\nfacilitate his identification, if the police should ever be on his\ntrack! \"Bah!\" exclaimed the major. \"It is as I tell you,\" persisted Paganel. \"What matter, my worthy friend?\" \"Is that your opinion?\" \"On the contrary, you are only more remarkable. This adds to your\npersonal advantages.

A short interview took place between MacNabb and the lady, and fifteen\nweeks after a marriage was celebrated with great pomp in the chapel of\nMalcolm Castle.

This supposition seemed plausible, for one\nhalf of the bridge lay beneath the fragments of the cars, while the\nother still hung intact in its chains. Doubt was no longer possible;\nsurely carelessness must have caused the calamity. The accident had happened to the night express, which left Melbourne\nat forty-five minutes past eleven.

The travelers\nand employés of the last car at once busied themselves in seeking\nassistance; but the telegraph-wires, whose poles lay on the ground,\nwere no longer available. It took the authorities of Castlemaine three\nhours to reach the scene of the disaster; and it was, therefore, six\no'clock in the morning before a corps of workers was organized under\nthe direction of the surveyor-general of the district, and a detachment\nof policemen, commanded by an officer. The squatters had come to their\naid, and exerted themselves to extinguish the fire, which consumed the\nheap of ruins with unconquerable fierceness.

Glenarvan turned to Mr. Mitchell, the surveyor-general, with a\nquestioning look. \"That is correct,\" said the latter; \"our examination has convinced us\nthat the catastrophe is the result of a crime.

In the clover-fields beyond the chestnut-trees, a lark\nwas mounting up to heaven, while pouring out her clear morning song.

Emotion stifled him, and, kneeling, he wept\nbeside this child so miraculously saved. CHAPTER XV. THALCAVE. After the great danger that he had just escaped, Robert incurred\nanother, no less great,--that of being overwhelmed with caresses. However feeble he was still, not one of these good people could refrain\nfrom pressing him to his heart. But it must be confessed that these\nwell-meant embraces are not fatal, for the boy did not die. When his rescue was certain, thought reverted to his rescuer, and the\nmajor very naturally thought of looking around him. Fifty paces from\nthe stream, a man of lofty stature was standing, motionless, on one\nof the first ledges of the mountain. A long gun lay at his feet. This\nindividual, who had so suddenly appeared, had broad shoulders, and\nlong hair tied with leathern thongs. His height exceeded six feet, and\nhis bronzed face was red between his eyes and mouth, black below his\neyelids, and white on his forehead. After the manner of the Patagonians\nof the frontiers, the native wore a splendid cloak, decorated with\nred arabesques, made of the skin of a guanaco, its silky fur turned\noutward, and sewed with ostrich-tendons. Under his cloak a tippet of\nfox-skin encircled his neck and terminated in a point in front. At his\ngirdle hung a little bag containing the colors with which he painted\nhis face. His leggings were of ox-hide, and fastened to the ankle with\nstraps regularly crossed. The figure of this Patagonian was fine, and his face denoted real\nintelligence in spite of the colors that adorned (!) it. He waited in\nan attitude full of dignity, and, seeing him so motionless and stern on\nhis pedestal of rocks, you would have taken him for a statue. The major, as soon as he perceived him, pointed him out to Glenarvan,\nwho hastened towards him. The Patagonian took two steps forward;\nGlenarvan took his hand, and pressed it. There was in the latter's\nlook, in his physiognomy, such a feeling, such an expression of\ngratitude, that the native could not mistake it. He inclined his head\ngently, and uttered a few words that neither the major nor his friend\ncould understand. The Patagonian, after regarding the strangers attentively, now changed\nthe language; but whatever it was, this new idiom was no better\nunderstood than the first. However, certain expressions which he used\nstruck Glenarvan. They seemed to belong to the Spanish language, of\nwhich he knew several common words. \"Spanish?\" said he. The Patagonian nodded. \"Well,\" said the major, \"this is our friend Paganel's business. It is\nfortunate that he thought of learning Spanish.\" Paganel was called. He came at once and with all the grace of a\nFrenchman saluted the Patagonian, to which the latter paid no\nattention. The geographer was informed of the state of affairs, and was\nonly too glad to use his diligently-acquired knowledge. [Sidenote: SOMETHING WRONG.] \"Exactly,\" said he. And opening his mouth widely in order to articulate\nbetter, he said, in his best Spanish,--\n\n\"You--are--a--brave--man.\" The native listened, but did not answer. \"He does not understand,\" said the geographer. \"Perhaps you do not pronounce well,\" replied the major. \"Very true!

Of all the passengers, the one most to be pitied was Lord Glenarvan. They rarely saw him below; he could not keep still. His nervous and\nexcitable nature would not submit to an imprisonment between four\nwooden walls. Day and night, heedless of the torrents of rain and the\ndashing spray of the sea, he remained on deck, sometimes bending over\nthe rail, sometimes pacing up and down with feverish agitation. His\neyes gazed continually into space, and, during the brief lulls, his\nglass persistently surveyed the horizon. He seemed to question the mute\nwaves; the mist that veiled the sky, the masses of vapor, he would have\npenetrated with a glance; he could not be resigned, and his countenance\nbetokened an acute grief. The power and hopefulness of this man,\nhitherto so energetic and courageous, had suddenly failed. Captain Mangles seldom left him, but at his side endured the severity\nof the storm. That day, Glenarvan, wherever there was an opening in\nthe mist, scanned the horizon with the utmost persistency. The young\ncaptain approached him. \"Is your lordship looking for land?\" he asked. Glenarvan shook his head. \"It will yet be some time before we leave the brig. We ought to have\nsighted Auckland light thirty-six hours ago.\" Glenarvan did not answer.

His\nrelations struck their heads together; his kinswomen lacerated their\nfaces with their nails, and showed themselves more lavish of blood than\nof tears. These unfortunate females conscientiously fulfilled their\nbarbarous duty. But these demonstrations were not enough to appease the soul of the\ndeceased, whose wrath would doubtless have smitten the survivors of his\ntribe; and his warriors, as they could not recall him to life, wished\nthat he should have no cause to regret in the other world the happiness\nof this.

Moreover,\nthe unfortunate woman would not have been allowed to survive him;\nit was the custom, in accordance with duty, and examples of such\nsacrifices are not wanting in New Zealand history. The woman appeared. She was still young. Her hair floated in disorder over her shoulders. Vague words, lamentations, and broken phrases, in which she celebrated\nthe virtues of the dead, interrupted her groans; and, in a final\nparoxysm of grief, she stretched herself at the foot of the mound,\nbeating the ground with her head. At this moment Kai-Koumou approached her. Suddenly the unfortunate\nvictim rose; but a violent blow with the \"méré,\" a formidable club,\nwielded by the hand of the chief, struck her lifeless to the earth.

But for the eternal life his faithful spouse could\nnot alone suffice the deceased. Who would serve them in presence of\nNouï-Atoua, if their slaves did not follow them?

Moreover, this\ndeath was rapid, protracted sufferings were spared them. These were\nreserved for the captives who stood trembling not twenty paces distant. Six blows of the méré, given by six stalwart warriors, stretched the\nvictims on the ground in a pool of blood. It was the signal for a\nterrible scene of cannibalism, which followed in all its horrible\ndetails. Glenarvan and his companions, breathless with fright, strove to hide\nthis awful scene from the eyes of the two unhappy ladies.

Every word the\nPatagonian said he repeated in English, so that his companions heard\nthe Indian speak, as it were, in their own language. \"And this prisoner?\" inquired Paganel. \"He was a stranger,\" replied Thalcave slowly; \"a European.\" \"You have seen him?\" \"No, but he is mentioned in the accounts of the Indians.

He took the boy in his arms, lifted him from his horse, and gazed at\nhim with the most curious sympathy. His intelligent countenance became\nsuffused with a peaceful emotion. But Paganel had not finished his inquiries. Where was this prisoner? What was he doing? When had Thalcave heard of him? All these questions\nthronged his mind at once. He did not have to wait long for answers,\nbut learnt that the European was a slave of one of the Indian tribes\nthat scour the plains. \"But where was he last?\" asked Paganel. \"With the cazique Calfoucoura,\" answered Thalcave. \"On the line we have been following?\" \"Yes.\" \"And who is this cazique?\" \"The chief of the Poyuches Indians; a man with two tongues and two\nhearts.\" [Sidenote: A SCIENTIFIC BATH.] \"That is to say, false in word and in deed,\" said Paganel, after\ntranslating to his companions this beautiful metaphor of the Indian\nlanguage. \"And can we rescue our friend?\" he added. \"Perhaps so, if your friend is still in the hands of the Indians.\" \"And when did you hear of him?\" \"A long time ago, and, since then, the sun has brought back two summers\nto the sky.\" Glenarvan's joy could not be described. This answer coincided exactly\nwith the date of the document. But one question remained to be asked. \"You speak of a prisoner,\" said Paganel; \"but were there not three?\" \"I do not know,\" replied Thalcave. \"And you know nothing of their actual situation?\" \"Nothing.\" This last word ended the conversation. It was possible that the three\nprisoners had been separated a long time. But the substance of the\nPatagonian's information was that the Indians spoke of a European who\nhad fallen into their power. The date of his captivity, the place where\nhe must have been, everything, even to the Patagonian phrase used to\nexpress his courage, related evidently to Captain Harry Grant. Their progress was now somewhat slow and difficult; their next object\nbeing to reach and cross the river Colorado, to which at length\ntheir horses brought them. Here Paganel's first care was to bathe\n\"geographically\" in its waters, which are colored by a reddish clay.

But here a serious\ndisappointment awaited them,--the lake was dry! CHAPTER XVIII. IN SEARCH OF WATER. Lake Salinas terminates the cluster of lagoons that adjoin the Ventana\nand Guamini mountains. Numerous expeditions are made to this place\nto obtain supplies of salt, with which these waters are strongly\nimpregnated. But now the water had evaporated under the heat of the\nsun, and the lake was only a vast glittering basin. When Thalcave announced the presence of a drinkable liquid at Lake\nSalinas, he meant the streams of fresh water that flow from it in\nmany places. But at this time its affluents were as dry as itself. The burning sun had absorbed everything. Hence, the consternation was\ngeneral when the thirsty party arrived at the parched shores of Lake\nSalinas. It was necessary to take counsel. The little water in the leathern\nbottles was half spoiled, and could not quench their thirst, which\nbegan to make itself acutely felt. Hunger and fatigue gave place to\nthis imperative want. A \"roukah,\" a kind of upright tent, of leather,\nwhich stood in a hollow, and had been abandoned by the natives, served\nas a refuge for the travelers, while their horses, stretched on the\nmuddy shores of the lake, ate the saline plants and dry reeds, although\nreluctantly. When each had sat down in the roukah, Paganel asked Thalcave's advice\nas to what was best to be done.

Glenarvan blindly persisted in his resolve to sacrifice\nhimself, when suddenly he was pushed violently back.

An ominous silence reigned over the plain. \"They are going,\" said Robert. \"Perhaps,\" replied Glenarvan, who was listening with intentness. But Thalcave shook his head. He knew well that the animals would not\nabandon a certain prey until at daybreak they returned to their holes\nand dens. However, the tactics of their enemies had evidently changed, they no\nlonger endeavored to force the entrance of the ramada; but their new\nmanoeuvres were already causing a still more imminent danger. The wolves, abandoning their design of penetrating the inclosure by\nthis entrance, which was defended by weapon and fire, went to the\nback of the ramada and sought to assail it in the rear. Their claws\nwere soon heard rattling against the half-decayed wood. Already their\npowerful paws and bloody mouths had forced their way between the\nshattered stakes. The horses, bewildered and panic-stricken, broke\ntheir halters and dashed into the inclosure. Glenarvan seized Robert\nin his arms, to defend him to the last extremity; and he would have\nattempted a rash flight, and rushed out of the ramada, had not his eyes\nfallen upon the Indian. Thalcave, turning like a deer, had suddenly approached his horse,\nwhich was neighing with impatience, and was beginning to saddle him\ncarefully, forgetting neither strap nor buckle. He seemed no longer to\ncare for the howls, that were now redoubled. Glenarvan gazed at him\nwith a dark foreboding. \"He is leaving us!\" cried he, seeing Thalcave gather up his reins as\nthough he were about to mount. \"He? never!\" said Robert. In truth the Indian was about to make a venture, not to leave his\nfriends, but to save them by sacrificing himself. Thaouka was ready. He champed his bit; he pranced; his eyes, full of a fiery spirit, shot\nforth lightning flashes; he understood his master. Just as the Indian was seizing the mane of his horse, Glenarvan caught\nhim by the arm with a convulsive grasp. \"You are going?\" said he, pointing to the plain, which was now deserted. \"Yes,\" replied the Indian, who comprehended the gesture of his\ncompanion; and, with vehement gesticulations which were however\nperfectly intelligible, he added a few words in Spanish, which\nsignified: \"Thaouka--good horse--swift--will draw the wolves after him.\" [Illustration: Frightful howls resounded. The wolves, starting on the\ntrack of the horse, fled into the darkness with a terrible speed.] \"Ha! Thalcave!\" cried Glenarvan. \"Quick, quick!\"", "similarity": 0.4249304234981537}, {"chunk_id": 49, "text": "The condor became more distinct every\nmoment.

He attacks sheep, goats, and calves\nwandering on the plain, and carries them in his talons to a great\nheight. Sometimes he hovers at an elevation beyond the limit of human\nvision, and there this king of the air surveys, with a piercing look,\nthe regions below, and distinguishes the faintest objects with a power\nof sight that is the astonishment of naturalists. What had the condor seen? A corpse,--that of Robert Grant? \"Who knows?\" repeated Glenarvan, without losing sight of him. The enormous bird\napproached, now hovering, now falling with the swiftness of inert\nbodies. He soon described circles of larger extent, and could be\nperfectly distinguished. He measured fifteen feet across his wings,\nwhich supported him in the air almost without motion, for it is the\npeculiarity of these great birds to sail with a majestic calmness\nunlike all others of the winged tribes. The major and Wilson had seized their rifles, but Glenarvan stopped\nthem with a gesture. The condor was approaching in the circles of his\nflight a sort of inaccessible plateau a quarter of a mile distant. He was turning with a vertical rapidity, opening and closing his\nformidable claws, and shaking his cartilaginous neck. [Sidenote: SOMETHING WORSE.] \"There! there!\" cried Glenarvan. Then suddenly a thought flashed through his mind. \"If Robert is still living!\" exclaimed he, with a cry of terror, \"this\nbird! Fire, my friends, fire!\" But he was too late. The condor had disappeared behind the lofty\nboulders. A second passed that seemed an eternity. Then the enormous\nbird reappeared, heavily laden, and rising slowly. A cry of horror was uttered. In the claws of the condor an inanimate\nbody was seen suspended and dangling. It was Robert Grant. The bird had\nraised him by his garments, and was now hovering in mid-air at least\none hundred and fifty feet above the encampment. He had perceived the\ntravelers, and was violently striving to escape with his heavy prey. [Illustration]\n\n\"May Robert's body be dashed upon these rocks,\" cried Glenarvan,\n\"rather than serve----\"\n\nHe did not finish, but, seizing Wilson's rifle, attempted to take aim\nat the condor.

With clear eye, steady hand, and motionless body, he aimed at the bird,\nthat was already three hundred feet above him. But he had not pressed\nthe trigger, when a report resounded in the valley. A light smoke\ncurled up between two rocks, and the condor, shot in the head, fell,\nslowly turning, sustained by his broad outspread wings. He had not\nreleased his prey, and at last reached the ground, ten paces from the\nbanks of the stream. \"Quick! quick!\" said Glenarvan; and without seeking whence this\nprovidential shot had come, he rushed towards the condor. His\ncompanions closely followed him. [Illustration]\n\n[Sidenote: \"THE LOST IS FOUND.\"] When they arrived the bird was dead, and the body of Robert was hidden\nunder its great wings.

Besides, he set the example himself. \"Laugh, my friends,\" said he, \"laugh with a will! you cannot laugh as\nmuch as I do at myself.\" And he uttered the most formidable peal of laughter that ever issued\nfrom the mouth of a geographer. \"But we are none the less without an interpreter,\" said the major. \"Oh, do not be troubled,\" replied Paganel. \"The Portuguese and Spanish\nresemble each other so much that I made a mistake. However, this very\nresemblance will soon enable me to rectify my error, and in a short\ntime I will thank this worthy Patagonian in the language he speaks so\nwell.\" Paganel was right, for he could soon exchange a few words with the\nnative. He even learned that his name was Thalcave, a word which\nsignifies in Araucanian \"the thunderer.\" This surname was doubtless\ngiven to him for his skill in the use of fire-arms. [Sidenote: BETTER PROSPECTS.] But Glenarvan was particularly rejoiced to discover that the Patagonian\nwas a guide, and, moreover, a guide of the Pampas. There was,\ntherefore, something so providential in this meeting that the success\nof the enterprise seemed already an accomplished fact, and no one any\nlonger doubted the rescue of Captain Grant. In the meantime the travelers and the Patagonian had returned to\nRobert. The latter stretched his arms towards the native, who, without\na word, placed his hand upon his head. He examined the child and felt\nhis wounded limbs. Then, smiling, he went and gathered on the banks\nof the stream a few handfuls of wild celery, with which he rubbed the\nboy's body. Under this treatment, performed with an extreme gentleness,\nthe child felt his strength revive, and it was plain that a few hours\nwould suffice to restore him. It was therefore decided that that day and the following night should\nbe passed at the encampment. Besides, two important questions remained\nto be settled--food, and means of conveyance. Provisions and mules were\nboth wanting. Fortunately Thalcave solved the difficulty. This guide, who was\naccustomed to conduct travelers along the Patagonian frontiers, and\nwas one of the most intelligent baqueanos of the country, engaged to\nfurnish Glenarvan all that his little party needed. He offered to take\nhim to a \"tolderia\" (encampment) of Indians, about four miles distant,\nwhere they would find everything necessary for the expedition. This\nproposal was made partly by gestures, partly by Spanish words which\nPaganel succeeded in understanding. It was accepted, and Glenarvan and\nhis learned friend, taking leave of their companions, reascended the\nstream under the guidance of the Patagonian. They proceeded at a good pace for an hour and a half, taking long\nstrides to keep up to the giant Thalcave. All the region was charming,\nand of a rich fertility. The grassy pastures succeeded each other,\nand could easily have fed thousands of cattle. Large ponds, united by\na winding chain of streams, gave these plains a verdant moisture. Black-headed swans sported on the mirror-like surface, and disputed the\nempire of the waters with numberless ostriches that gamboled over the\nplains, while the brilliant feathered tribes were in wonderful variety.

His eccentricities (and his abilities) made him much talked of in\nScotland. People seemed as though they could not show him enough\nattention. Just at this time an amiable lady of thirty, none other than the\nmajor's cousin, a little eccentric herself, but still agreeable and\ncharming, fell in love with the geographer's peculiarities. Paganel was\nfar from being insensible to Miss Arabella's attractions, yet did not\ndare to declare his sentiments. The major accordingly undertook the\npart of Cupid's messenger between these two congenial hearts, and even\ntold Paganel that marriage was \"the last blunder\" that he could commit. But the geographer was very much embarrassed, and, strangely enough,\ncould not summon courage to speak for himself. [Illustration: Early in the afternoon the travelers reached Malcolm\nCastle, amidst the hurrahs of their tenantry and friends.] \"Does not Miss Arabella please you?\" MacNabb would say to him. \"Oh, major, she is charming!\" cried Paganel,--\"a thousand times too\ncharming for me; and, if I must tell you, would please me better if she\nwere less so. I should like to find a defect.\" \"Be easy,\" answered the major; \"she has more than one. The most perfect\nwoman always has her share. Well, then, Paganel, are you decided?\" \"I do not dare.\" \"But, my learned friend, why do you hesitate?\" \"I am unworthy of her!\" was the geographer's invariable reply. At last, one day, driven desperate by the irrepressible major, Paganel\nconfessed to him, under the pledge of secrecy, a peculiarity that would\nfacilitate his identification, if the police should ever be on his\ntrack! \"Bah!\" exclaimed the major. \"It is as I tell you,\" persisted Paganel. \"What matter, my worthy friend?\" \"Is that your opinion?\" \"On the contrary, you are only more remarkable. This adds to your\npersonal advantages.

Let us search these bushes\naround the cart.\" [Sidenote: UNRAVELINGS.] The major and captain scoured the surrounding country. But from the\nedge of the wood to the banks of the Snowy they did not meet with a\nsingle convict. Ben Joyce's band seemed to have flown away, like a\nflock of mischievous birds. This disappearance was too strange to\ninspire a perfect security. They therefore resolved to keep on the\nwatch. The cart, which was a really immovable fortress, became the\ncentre of the encampment, and two men kept guard, relieving each other\nevery hour.

Having\nfulfilled this duty, and enjoyed this privilege, the prisoners embraced\neach other. Lady Helena and Mary Grant then retired to one corner of\nthe hut, and stretched themselves upon a mat. Sleep, which soothes all\nwoes, soon closed their eyes, and they slumbered in each other's arms,\novercome by fatigue and long wakefulness. Glenarvan, taking his friends aside, said:\n\n\"My dear companions, our lives and those of these poor ladies are in\nGod's hands. If Heaven has decreed that we shall die to-morrow, we can,\nI am sure, die like brave people, like Christians, ready to appear\nfearlessly before the final Judge.

However severe his decree may\nbe, I shall not murmur against it. But this is not death alone; it is\ntorture, disgrace; and here are two women----\"\n\nGlenarvan's voice, hitherto firm, now faltered. He paused to control\nhis emotion. After a moment's silence, he said to the young captain:\n\n\"John, you have promised Mary Grant what I have promised Lady Helena. What have you resolved?\" \"This promise,\" replied John Mangles, \"I believe I have the right in\nthe sight of God to fulfill.\" \"Yes, John; but we have no weapons.\" \"Here is one,\" answered John, displaying a poniard. \"I snatched it from\nKara-Tété's hands when he fell at your feet. My lord, he of us who\nsurvives the other shall fulfill this vow.\" At these words a profound silence reigned in the hut. At last the major\ninterrupted it by saying:\n\n\"My friends, reserve this extreme measure till the last moment. I am no\nadvocate of what is irremediable.\" \"I do not speak for ourselves,\" replied Glenarvan. \"We can brave\ndeath, whatever it may be. Ah, if we were alone! Twenty times already\nwould I have urged you to make a sally and attack those wretches. But\n_they_----\"\n\n[Sidenote: THE APPROACH OF DAY.] At this moment Captain Mangles raised the mat and counted twenty-five\nnatives, who were watching at the door of their prison.

Indeed,\nthe design of one is stronger than that of the other, for the first\nmay forget that he is guarding, but the second cannot forget that he\nis guarded; the captive thinks oftener of escaping than his guardian\nthinks of preventing his escape. But here it was hate and vengeance\nthat watched the prisoners, and not an indifferent jailer. They had not\nbeen bound, for bonds were useless where twenty-five men guarded the\nonly outlet of the prison. This hut was built against the rock that terminated the fortification,\nand was only accessible by a narrow passage that connected it with the\nfront of the pah.

Then, in a lower tone, he\nrepeated: \"Aland! aland! aland!\" He had risen; he had seized the paper. He shook it, seeking to\nrepress words ready to escape his lips.

Everything was\nready for the departure of Mulready, who was happy to give his master\nthis proof of his devotion. Paganel had regained his coolness and accustomed manners. His look\nstill indicated an uneasy state of mind, but he appeared decided to\nkeep his secret. He had doubtless strong reasons for acting thus,\nfor the major overheard him repeating these words, like a man who is\nstruggling with himself:\n\n\"No, no! they would not believe me! And, besides what use is it? It is\ntoo late!\" [Illustration: \"Adieu, my lord,\" said he, in a calm voice, and soon\ndisappeared by a path along the edge of the wood.] This resolution taken, he occupied himself with giving Mulready the\nnecessary directions for reaching Melbourne, and, with the map before\nhim, marked out his course. All the trails of the prairie converged\ntowards the Lucknow road, which, after extending straight southward to\nthe coast, suddenly turned in the direction towards Melbourne. It was\nsimply necessary to follow this, and not attempt to cross the unknown\ncountry. Mulready could not, therefore, go astray.

Even without his speaking you felt that he was a talker; but\nhe was abstracted, after the manner of those who do not see what they\nare looking at or hear what they are listening to. He wore a traveling\ncap, stout yellow buskins and leather gaiters, pantaloons of maroon\nvelvet, and a jacket of the same material, whose innumerable pockets\nseemed stuffed with note-books, memoranda, scraps, portfolios, and a\nthousand articles as inconvenient as they were useless, not to speak\nof a telescope which he carried in a sling.

When this enigmatical character saw his approaches mocked by the\nindifference of the major, he seized his telescope, which at its full\nlength measured four feet; and motionless, with legs straddled, like a\nsign-post on a highway, he pointed his instrument to the line where sky\nand water met.

He allowed this bloody orgy an hour to reach its utmost\nintensity. The last act of the funeral was played with the usual rites. The bodies of Kara-Tété and his wife were taken up, and their limbs\nbent and gathered against the stomach, according to the New Zealand\ncustom. The place for the tomb had been chosen outside of the\nfortification, about two miles distant, on the summit of a small\nmountain, called Maunganamu, situated on the right shore of the lake. Thither the bodies were to be carried. Two very rude palanquins, or\nrather litters, were brought to the foot of the mound. The corpses,\nfolded together, in a sitting posture, and tied in their clothes by a\ngirdle of withes, were placed on this primitive bier. Four warriors\nbore it between them, and the entire tribe, chanting the funeral hymn,\nfollowed them in procession to the place of burial. The captives, who were always watched, saw them leave the inner\ninclosure of the pah, and then the songs and cries gradually died away.

The distance gave a fantastic appearance to the\nundulating movements of the long, sinuous column. The tribe stopped at the summit of the mountain, which was eight\nhundred feet high, at the place prepared for Kara-Tété's interment. A common Maori would have had only a hole and a heap of stones for a\ngrave; but for a powerful and dreaded chief, destined doubtless for a\nspeedy deification, a tomb worthy of his exploits was reserved.

But if Kai-Koumou was outwitted, they believed\nthemselves safe from all the savages of New Zealand. A whole day must pass before the decisive attempt could be made, and\nthey employed their time in arranging a plan of escape.

They therefore determined to avoid them at all\nhazards, and gain the eastern coast, where the missionaries have\nfounded several establishments. Moreover, this portion of the island\nhad hitherto escaped the ravages of the war and the depredations of the\nnatives. As for the distance that separated Lake Taupo from the Bay of\nPlenty, it could not be more than one hundred miles. Ten days would\nsuffice for the journey.

They stopped at the least sound,--they examined the faintest\nlight; each slid down the declivity, the better to elude detection. Two hundred feet below the summit, Captain Mangles and his sailor\nreached the dangerous ridge that had been so obstinately guarded by the\nnatives. If, unfortunately, the Maoris, more crafty than the fugitives,\nhad feigned a retreat to entice them within reach, if they had not\nbeen deceived by the eruption, their presence would be discovered\nat this point.

If the savages were still in\nambush, these unusual sounds would provoke from each side a formidable\nvolley. However, in gliding like serpents along this inclined crest, the\nfugitives could not advance rapidly.

But it ought to and will succeed.\" \"And this project?\" asked the major. \"This is it,\" replied Paganel. \"The superstition of the natives has\nmade this mountain a place of refuge, and this superstition must help\nus to escape. If I succeed in convincing Kai-Koumou that we have become\nthe victims of our sacrilege, that the wrath of Heaven has fallen upon\nus, in short, that we have met a terrible death, do you think that he\nwill abandon the mountain and return to his village?\" \"Probably,\" said Glenarvan. \"And with what horrible death do you threaten us?\" inquired Lady Helena. \"The death of the sacrilegious, my friends,\" continued Paganel. \"The\navenging flames are under our feet. Let us open a way for them.\" \"What! you would make a volcano?\" cried Captain Mangles. \"Yes, a factitious, an improvised one, whose fury we will control. There is quite a supply of vapors and subterranean fires that only\nask for an outlet. Let us arrange an artificial eruption for our own\nadvantage.\" \"The idea is good,\" said the major, \"and well conceived, Paganel.\" \"You understand,\" resumed the geographer, \"that we are to feign being\nconsumed by the flames of Pluto, and shall disappear spiritually in the\ntomb of Kara-Tété.\" [Sidenote: A VOLCANO IN MINIATURE.] \"Where we shall remain three, four, or five days, if necessary, till\nthe savages are convinced of our death, and abandon the siege.\" \"But if they think of making sure of our destruction,\" said Miss Grant,\n\"and climb the mountain?\" \"No, my dear Mary,\" replied Paganel, \"they will not do that. The\nmountain is tabooed, and if it shall itself devour its profaners the\ntaboo will be still more rigorous.\" \"This plan is really well conceived,\" remarked Glenarvan. \"There is\nonly one chance against it, and that is, that the savages may persist\nin remaining at the foot of the mountain till the provisions fail\nus. But this is scarcely probable, especially if we play our part\nskillfully.\" \"And when shall we make this last venture?\" asked Lady Helena. \"This very evening,\" answered Paganel, \"at the hour of the greatest\ndarkness.\" \"Agreed,\" said MacNabb. \"Paganel, you are a man of genius; and although\nfrom habit I am scarcely ever enthusiastic, I will answer for your\nsuccess. Ha! these rascals! we shall perform a little miracle for them\nthat will delay their conversion a good century. May the missionaries\npardon us!\" Paganel's plan was therefore adopted, and really, with the\nsuperstitious notions of the Maoris, it might and ought to succeed. It only remained to execute it. The idea was good, but in practice\ndifficult. Might not this volcano consume the audacious ones who should\ndig the crater?", "similarity": 0.4730967581272125}]}

At this moment a commotion took place among the natives. Glenarvan cast\na rapid glance around him. The crowd opened, and a warrior, dripping\nwith sweat and overcome with fatigue, appeared.

They were to attend\nthat day the funeral of the dead chief, and the bloody ceremonies\nconnected therewith. A party of natives conducted them to the foot of\nan enormous koudi, where these guardians remained without losing sight\nof their prisoners. The rest of the tribe, absorbed in their official\nmourning, seemed to have forgotten them. The customary three days had elapsed since the death of Kara-Tété. The\nsoul of the deceased had therefore forever abandoned its mortal abode. The sacred rites began. The body was carried to a small mound in the centre of the\nfortification, clothed in splendid costume, and enveloped in a\nmagnificent flaxen mat. The head was adorned with plumes, and wore a\ncrown of green leaves. The face, arms, and breast had been rubbed with\noil, and therefore showed no mortification.

[Sidenote: NEW ZEALAND TOPOGRAPHY.] Long before historic times, an abyss, twenty-five miles long and\ntwenty wide, must at some period have been formed by a subsidence of\nsubterranean caverns in the volcanic district forming the centre of\nthe island. The waters of the surrounding country have rushed down and\nfilled this enormous cavity, and the abyss has become a lake, whose\ndepth no one has yet been able to measure. Such is this strange Lake Taupo, elevated eleven hundred and fifty\nfeet above the level of the sea, and surrounded by lofty mountains. On\nthe west of the prisoners towered precipitous rocks of imposing form;\non the north rose several distant ridges, crowned with small forests;\non the east spread a broad plain furrowed by a trail and covered with\npumice-stones that glittered beneath a net-work of bushes; and on\nthe north, behind a stretch of woodland, volcanic peaks majestically\nencircled this vast extent of water, the fury of whose tempests equaled\nthat of the ocean cyclones. But Paganel was scarcely disposed to enlarge his account of these\nwonders, nor were his friends in a mood to listen. They gazed in\nsilence towards the northeast shore of the lake, whither the canoe was\nbringing them. The mission established at Pukawa, on the western shores, no longer\nexisted. The missionary had been driven by the war far from the\nprincipal dwellings of the insurrectionists. The prisoners were\nhelpless, abandoned to the mercy of the vengeful Maoris, and in that\nwild part of the island to which Christianity has never penetrated. Kai-Koumou, leaving the waters of the Waikato, passed through the\nlittle creek which served as an outlet to the river, doubled a sharp\npromontory, and landed on the eastern border of the lake, at the base\nof the first slopes of Mount Manga. A quarter of a mile distant, on a buttress of the mountain, appeared\na \"pah,\" a Maori fortification, situated in an impregnable position. The prisoners were taken ashore, with their hands and feet free, and\nconducted thither by the warriors. After quite a long détour, Glenarvan\nand his companions reached the pah. [Illustration: At noon the whole fleet of boats entered Lake Taupo.] [Illustration: On their arrival, the captives were terribly impressed\nat sight of the heads that ornamented the stakes of the second\ninclosure.] This fortress was defended by an outer rampart of strong palisades,\nfifteen feet high.

On their arrival, the captives were terribly impressed at sight of\nthe heads that ornamented the stakes of the second inclosure. Lady\nHelena and Mary Grant turned away their eyes with more of disgust than\nterror.

The\ngeographer knew them to be such by their hollow and eyeless sockets! In Kai-Koumou's pah only the heads of his enemies formed this frightful\nmuseum; and here, doubtless, more than one English skull had served to\nincrease the size of the chief's collection. His hut, among those belonging to warriors of lower rank, stood at the\nrear of the pah, in front of a large open terrace.

I would have torn out your heart, I would have hung your companions'\nheads and yours forever to the stakes of this palisade.

Then, after a few moments, he resumed, more coolly:\n\n\"Do you think the English will give us our Tohonga in exchange for you?\" Glenarvan hesitated, and watched the Maori chief very attentively. \"I do not know,\" said he, after a moment's silence. \"Speak,\" continued Kai-Koumou. \"Is your life worth that of our Tohonga?\" \"No,\" answered Glenarvan. \"I am neither a chief nor a priest among my\npeople.\" Paganel was astounded at this reply, and gazed at Glenarvan in profound\nwonder. Kai-Koumou seemed equally surprised. \"Then you doubt it?\" said he. \"I do not know,\" repeated Glenarvan. \"Will not your people accept you in exchange for our Tohonga?\" \"Not me alone,\" replied Glenarvan; \"but perhaps all of us.\" \"Among the Maoris,\" said Kai-Koumou, \"it is one for one.\" \"Offer these ladies first in exchange for your priest,\" answered\nGlenarvan, pointing to Lady Helena and Mary Grant. Lady Helena would\nhave rushed towards her husband, but the major restrained her. \"These two ladies,\" continued Glenarvan, turning respectfully towards\nthem, \"hold a high rank in their country.\" The warrior glanced coldly at his prisoner. A malicious smile passed\nover his face; but he almost instantly repressed it, and replied, in a\nvoice which he could scarcely control:\n\n\"Do you hope, then, to deceive Kai-Koumou by false words, cursed\nEuropean? Do you think that Kai-Koumou's eyes cannot read your heart?\" Then, pointing to Lady Helena, he said:\n\n\"That is your wife!\" \"No, mine!\" cried Kara-Tété. Then, pushing back the prisoners, the chief laid his hand on Lady\nHelena's shoulder, who grew pale at the touch. \"Edward!\" cried the unfortunate woman, in terror. Glenarvan, without uttering a word, raised his arm. A report resounded. Kara-Tété fell dead. At this sound a crowd of natives issued from the huts. The pah was\nfilled in an instant. A hundred arms were raised against the captives. Glenarvan's revolver was snatched from his hand. Kai-Koumou cast a strange look at Glenarvan, and then, guarding with\none hand the person of him who had fired, he controlled with the other\nthe throng that was rushing upon the Europeans.

He allowed this bloody orgy an hour to reach its utmost\nintensity. The last act of the funeral was played with the usual rites. The bodies of Kara-Tété and his wife were taken up, and their limbs\nbent and gathered against the stomach, according to the New Zealand\ncustom. The place for the tomb had been chosen outside of the\nfortification, about two miles distant, on the summit of a small\nmountain, called Maunganamu, situated on the right shore of the lake. Thither the bodies were to be carried. Two very rude palanquins, or\nrather litters, were brought to the foot of the mound. The corpses,\nfolded together, in a sitting posture, and tied in their clothes by a\ngirdle of withes, were placed on this primitive bier. Four warriors\nbore it between them, and the entire tribe, chanting the funeral hymn,\nfollowed them in procession to the place of burial. The captives, who were always watched, saw them leave the inner\ninclosure of the pah, and then the songs and cries gradually died away. For about half an hour this funeral escort continued in sight, in the\ndepths of the valley. Finally they perceived it again winding along\nthe mountain paths. The distance gave a fantastic appearance to the\nundulating movements of the long, sinuous column. The tribe stopped at the summit of the mountain, which was eight\nhundred feet high, at the place prepared for Kara-Tété's interment. A common Maori would have had only a hole and a heap of stones for a\ngrave; but for a powerful and dreaded chief, destined doubtless for a\nspeedy deification, a tomb worthy of his exploits was reserved. [Sidenote: THE LAST NIGHT.] The sepulchre had been surrounded by palisades, while stakes,\nornamented with faces reddened with ochre, stood beside the grave\nwhere the bodies were to lie. The relatives had not forgotten that the\n\"waidoua\" (the spirit of the dead) feeds on substantial nourishment\nlike the body during this perishable life. Food had therefore been\ndeposited in the inclosure, together with the weapons and clothes of\nthe deceased. Nothing was wanting for the comfort of the tomb. Husband and wife were\nlaid side by side, and then covered with earth and grass after a series\nof renewed lamentations.

Well, then, see, here is\na gentleman who had none of these resources at his disposal—a\ngentleman, only a simple magistrate, who learned more than you with all\nyour police, and who would have saved my crown, if, like you, he had\nthe power of directing a telegraph.” The look of the minister of police\nwas turned with concentrated spite on Villefort, who bent his head in\nmodest triumph. “I do not mean that for you, Blacas,” continued Louis XVIII. ; “for if\nyou have discovered nothing, at least you have had the good sense to\npersevere in your suspicions. Any other than yourself would have\nconsidered the disclosure of M. de Villefort insignificant, or else\ndictated by venal ambition.” These words were an allusion to the\nsentiments which the minister of police had uttered with so much\nconfidence an hour before. Villefort understood the king’s intent. Any other person would,\nperhaps, have been overcome by such an intoxicating draught of praise;\nbut he feared to make for himself a mortal enemy of the police\nminister, although he saw that Dandré was irrevocably lost. In fact,\nthe minister, who, in the plenitude of his power, had been unable to\nunearth Napoleon’s secret, might in despair at his own downfall\ninterrogate Dantès and so lay bare the motives of Villefort’s plot. Realizing this, Villefort came to the rescue of the crest-fallen\nminister, instead of aiding to crush him. “Sire,” said Villefort, “the suddenness of this event must prove to\nyour majesty that the issue is in the hands of Providence; what your\nmajesty is pleased to attribute to me as profound perspicacity is\nsimply owing to chance, and I have profited by that chance, like a good\nand devoted servant—that’s all.", "similarity": 0.5877426862716675}, {"chunk_id": 485, "text": "“Sir,” said Villefort, after the first salutations were over, “you were\nsent for by M.

Valentine, by\nmeans of her love, her patience, and her devotion, had learned to read\nin Noirtier’s look all the varied feelings which were passing in his\nmind. To this dumb language, which was so unintelligible to others, she\nanswered by throwing her whole soul into the expression of her\ncountenance, and in this manner were the conversations sustained\nbetween the blooming girl and the helpless invalid, whose body could\nscarcely be called a living one, but who, nevertheless, possessed a\nfund of knowledge and penetration, united with a will as powerful as\never although clogged by a body rendered utterly incapable of obeying\nits impulses.

Villefort did not need the help of either Valentine or the domestic in\norder to carry on with his father the strange conversation which he was\nabout to begin. As we have said, he perfectly understood the old man’s\nvocabulary, and if he did not use it more often, it was only\nindifference and _ennui_ which prevented him from so doing.

He was particularly\ninterested in this young girl; and this feeling he concealed so well,\nthat, except Miss Grant and himself, no one on board the Duncan had\nperceived it. As for the learned geographer, he was probably the happiest man in the\nsouthern hemisphere. He passed his time in studying the maps with which\nhe covered the cabin-table; and then followed daily discussions with\nMr. Olbinett, so that he could scarcely set the table. But Paganel had all the passengers on his side except the major,\nwho was very indifferent to geographical questions, especially at\ndinner-time. Having discovered a whole cargo of odd books in the mate's\nchests, and among them a number of Cervantes' works, the Frenchman\nresolved to learn Spanish, which nobody on board knew, and which would\nfacilitate his search on the shores of Chili. Thanks to his love for\nphilology, he did not despair of speaking this new tongue fluently on\narriving at Concepcion. He therefore studied assiduously, and was heard\nincessantly muttering heterogeneous syllables. During his leisure hours\nhe did not fail to give young Robert practical instruction, and taught\nhim the history of the country they were rapidly approaching. In the meantime the Duncan was proceeding at a remarkable rate. She\ncut the Tropic of Capricorn, and her prow was headed toward the strait\nof the celebrated geographer. Now and then the low shores of Patagonia\nwere seen, but like an almost invisible line on the horizon. They\nsailed along the coast for more than ten miles, but Paganel's famous\ntelescope gave him only a vague idea of these American shores. The vessel soon found herself at the head of the strait, and entered\nwithout hesitation. This way is generally preferred by steam-vessels\nbound for the Pacific. Its exact length is three hundred and\nseventy-six miles. Ships of the greatest tonnage can always find deep\nwater, even near its shores, an excellent bottom, and many springs of\nwater. The rivers abound in fish, the forest in game, there are safe\nand easy landings at twenty places, and, in short, a thousand resources\nthat are wanting in the Strait of Lemaire, and off the terrible rocks\nof Cape Horn, which are continually visited by storms and tempests.

No inhabitant appeared on the shores of the\ncontinent; and only a few Fuegians wandered along the barren rocks of\nTerra del Fuego. At one moment the Duncan rounded the peninsula of Brunswick between\ntwo magnificent sights. Just here the strait cuts between stupendous\nmasses of granite.

I took a cab from the Caledonian Railway to the Scotia, in which I had\nengaged cabin number six at Paris. The night was dark. I saw no one on\nboard. Feeling fatigued by thirty hours of travel, and knowing that\na good way to avoid sea-sickness is to go to bed on embarking, and\nnot stir from your bunk for the first days of the voyage, I retired\nimmediately, and have conscientiously slept thirty-six hours, I assure\nyou.\" Jacques Paganel's hearers now knew the reason of his presence on board. The Frenchman, mistaking the vessel, had embarked while the crew of\nthe Duncan were engaged in the ceremony at Saint Mungo. Everything was\nexplained. But what would the geographer say, when he learned the name\nand destination of the vessel on which he had taken passage? \"So, Monsieur Paganel,\" said Glenarvan, \"you have chosen Calcutta as\nyour centre of action?\" \"Yes, my lord. To see India is an idea that I have cherished all my\nlife. It is my brightest dream, which shall be realized at last in the\ncountry of the elephants and the Thugs.\" \"Then you would not care to visit another country?\" \"No, my lord; it would be even disagreeable, for I have letters from\nLord Somerset to the governor-general of India, and a mission from the\nGeographical Society which I must fulfil.\" \"Ah! you have a mission?\" \"Yes, a useful and curious voyage to undertake, the programme of\nwhich has been arranged by my scientific friend and colleague, M.\nVivien de Saint Martin. It is to follow in the steps of the brothers\nSchlagintweit, and many other celebrated travelers. I hope to succeed\nwhere Missionary Krick unfortunately failed in 1846. In a word, I wish\nto discover the course of the Yaroo-tsang-bo-tsoo, which waters Thibet,\nand finally to settle whether this river does not join the Brahmapootra\nin the northeast part of Assam. A gold medal is promised to that\ntraveler who shall succeed in supplying this much-needed information on\nIndian geography.\" Paganel was grandiloquent. He spoke with a lofty animation, and was\ncarried away in the rapid flight of imagination. It would have been\nas impossible to check him as to stay the Rhine at the Falls of\nSchaffhausen. \"Monsieur Jacques Paganel,\" said Lord Glenarvan, after a moment\nof silence, \"that is certainly a fine voyage, and one for which\nscience would be very grateful; but I will not further prolong your\nignorance. For the present, you must give up the pleasure of seeing\nIndia.\" \"Give it up! And why?\" \"Because you are turning your back upon the Indian peninsula.\" \"How? Captain Burton----\"\n\n\"I am not Captain Burton,\" replied John Mangles. \"But the Scotia?\" \"This vessel is not the Scotia.\" Paganel's amazement cannot be depicted.", "similarity": 0.6115338206291199}, {"chunk_id": 33, "text": "So saying, Paganel spread out before them upon the table a large map of\nChili and the Argentine Provinces. \"Look,\" said he, \"and follow me in\nthis passage across the American continent.

No. Here are the Rio Negro, the Rio Colorado, and their\naffluents, cut by the thirty-seventh parallel, all of which might have\nserved to transport the document.

All rose to shake hands with him. \"Yes, my father is there!\" cried Robert Grant, devouring the map with\nhis eyes. \"And wherever he is,\" replied Glenarvan, \"we shall find him, my child. Nothing is more consistent than our friend Paganel's interpretation,\nand we must follow without hesitation the course he has indicated.

In\nthe former, after ascertaining his situation, we will join the Duncan\non the eastern coast, sail to Buenos Ayres, and with a detachment,\norganized by the major, can overcome all the Indians of the Argentine\nPlains.\" \"Yes, yes, your lordship,\" answered Captain Mangles; \"and I will add\nthat this passage of the continent will be without peril.\" \"Without peril, or fatigue,\" continued Paganel. \"How many have already\naccomplished it who had scarcely our means for success, and whose\ncourage was not sustained by the grandeur of the undertaking!\" \"Sir, sir,\" exclaimed Mary Grant, in a voice broken with emotion, \"how\ncan I thank a devotion that exposes you to so many dangers?\" \"Dangers!\" cried Paganel. \"Who uttered the word _danger_?\" \"Not I!\" replied Robert Grant, with flashing eye and determined look. \"Danger!\" repeated Paganel; \"does such a thing exist? Moreover, what is\nthe question? A journey of scarcely three hundred and fifty leagues,\nsince we shall proceed in a straight line; a journey which will be\naccomplished in a favorable latitude and climate; in short, a journey\nwhose duration will be only a month at most. It is a mere walk.\" \"Monsieur Paganel,\" asked Lady Helena at last, \"do you think that, if\nthe shipwrecked sailors have fallen into the power of the Indians,\ntheir lives have been spared?\" \"Certainly I do, madam. The Indians are not cannibals; far from that,\none of my countrymen whom I knew in the Society was three years\nprisoner among the Indians of the Pampas. He suffered, was ill-treated,\nbut at last gained the victory in this trying ordeal. A European is\na useful person in these countries. The Indians know his value, and\nesteem him very highly.\" \"Well then, there is no more hesitation,\" said Glenarvan; \"we must\nstart, and that, too, without delay. What course shall we take?\" \"An easy and agreeable one,\" replied Paganel.", "similarity": 0.5826791524887085}, {"chunk_id": 52, "text": "to start for India and arrive at Chili! to learn Spanish and speak Portuguese! this is too much, and, if it\ncontinues, I shall some day throw myself out of the window instead of\nmy cigar.\" To hear Paganel take his blunder thus, to see his comical actions, it\nwas impossible to keep serious. Besides, he set the example himself. \"Laugh, my friends,\" said he, \"laugh with a will! you cannot laugh as\nmuch as I do at myself.\" And he uttered the most formidable peal of laughter that ever issued\nfrom the mouth of a geographer. \"But we are none the less without an interpreter,\" said the major. \"Oh, do not be troubled,\" replied Paganel. \"The Portuguese and Spanish\nresemble each other so much that I made a mistake. However, this very\nresemblance will soon enable me to rectify my error, and in a short\ntime I will thank this worthy Patagonian in the language he speaks so\nwell.\" Paganel was right, for he could soon exchange a few words with the\nnative. He even learned that his name was Thalcave, a word which\nsignifies in Araucanian \"the thunderer.\" This surname was doubtless\ngiven to him for his skill in the use of fire-arms. [Sidenote: BETTER PROSPECTS.] But Glenarvan was particularly rejoiced to discover that the Patagonian\nwas a guide, and, moreover, a guide of the Pampas. There was,\ntherefore, something so providential in this meeting that the success\nof the enterprise seemed already an accomplished fact, and no one any\nlonger doubted the rescue of Captain Grant. In the meantime the travelers and the Patagonian had returned to\nRobert. The latter stretched his arms towards the native, who, without\na word, placed his hand upon his head. He examined the child and felt\nhis wounded limbs. Then, smiling, he went and gathered on the banks\nof the stream a few handfuls of wild celery, with which he rubbed the\nboy's body. Under this treatment, performed with an extreme gentleness,\nthe child felt his strength revive, and it was plain that a few hours\nwould suffice to restore him. It was therefore decided that that day and the following night should\nbe passed at the encampment. Besides, two important questions remained\nto be settled--food, and means of conveyance. Provisions and mules were\nboth wanting. Fortunately Thalcave solved the difficulty. This guide, who was\naccustomed to conduct travelers along the Patagonian frontiers, and\nwas one of the most intelligent baqueanos of the country, engaged to\nfurnish Glenarvan all that his little party needed. He offered to take\nhim to a \"tolderia\" (encampment) of Indians, about four miles distant,\nwhere they would find everything necessary for the expedition. This\nproposal was made partly by gestures, partly by Spanish words which\nPaganel succeeded in understanding. It was accepted, and Glenarvan and\nhis learned friend, taking leave of their companions, reascended the\nstream under the guidance of the Patagonian. They proceeded at a good pace for an hour and a half, taking long\nstrides to keep up to the giant Thalcave. All the region was charming,\nand of a rich fertility. The grassy pastures succeeded each other,\nand could easily have fed thousands of cattle. Large ponds, united by\na winding chain of streams, gave these plains a verdant moisture. Black-headed swans sported on the mirror-like surface, and disputed the\nempire of the waters with numberless ostriches that gamboled over the\nplains, while the brilliant feathered tribes were in wonderful variety. [Illustration]\n\nJacques Paganel proceeded from admiration to ecstasy.", "similarity": 0.5879930853843689}, {"chunk_id": 180, "text": "However, he was not deterred from rehearsing how one and\nanother not merely visited, but began to settle, on the island, so that\nin the treaty of 1814 it was formally recognized as belonging to Great\nBritain, and twenty years after was important enough to have a separate\nofficial and governmental establishment. Paganel also told, at great length, the tales of many of the sad\nincidents which from time to time have marked even the commercial\nintercourse between the European and the Maori; as, for instance, the\nsad tale of conflict and bloodshed connected with the death of Captain\nMarion, a French navigator, in 1772. He had landed near the spot where\nSurville had ill-treated some of the natives and traitorously seized\na son of the chief, Takouri, who yet appeared to welcome this next\nFrench visitant, though remembering none the less the terrible duty of\nvengeance which is felt by the Maori to be so binding. [Illustration: It was on the sixth of October, 1769, that this\nnavigator (Captain Cook) first landed on the shores.] For a long time the cloak of friendship was worn by the natives, the\nmore thoroughly to lull the suspicions of the whites, and to entice a\nlarger number on shore; in which endeavor they succeeded only too well. The French ships being greatly out of repair, Marion was induced to\nfell timber at some distance in the interior, and to establish in this\noccupation a great number of his men, going frequently to them, and\nremaining with them and the apparently friendly chiefs. On one of these\noccasions the Maoris fulfilled their revengeful project with a terrible\nsatisfaction to themselves. Only one man, of all those in the interior,\nmanaged to escape, the commander himself falling a prey to their\nvengeance. They then endeavored to kill the second in command, who,\nwith several others, was nearer to the shore. These, of course, at once\nstarted for their boats; breathless, they reached them, hotly pursued\nto the water's edge by the insatiate savages. Then, safe themselves,\nthe French marksmen picked off the chief, and the previous exultation\nof the aborigines was, even in the hour of their triumph, turned to\nlamentation, coupled with wonder at the terrible power of the white\nman's fire-barrel. [Illustration: Safe themselves, the French marksmen picked off the\nchief.] All this and much more did the geographer narrate; but it must be\nconfessed that he neither spoke, nor did they listen, with the\ncomplacency evinced in his previous tales. Besides, their surroundings\nwere at the time uncomfortable, and the first prognostications of a\nspeedy passage were not likely to be verified. Unfortunately, this painful voyage was prolonged. Six days after her\ndeparture, the Macquarie had not descried the shores of Auckland. The wind was fair, however, and still blew from the southwest; but\nnevertheless the brig did not make much headway. The sea was rough, the\nrigging creaked, the ribs cracked, and the vessel rode the waves with\ndifficulty. Fortunately, Will Halley, like a man who was in no hurry, did not crowd\non sail, or his masts would inevitably have snapped. Captain Mangles\nhoped, therefore, that this clumsy craft would reach its destination\nin safety; still, he was pained to see his companions on board in such\nmiserable quarters. [Sidenote: PERSISTENT GRIEF.] But neither Lady Helena nor Mary Grant complained, although the\ncontinual rain kept them confined, and the want of air and rolling of\nthe ship seriously incommoded them.", "similarity": 0.48313814401626587}]}

He did not admit, however, that Paganel was joking the least\nin the world. An Indian, with his natural seriousness, never imagines\nthat you are not speaking in earnest. \"You are not going to Carmen then?\" he added, after an instant of\nsilence. [Sidenote: A PROFESSORIAL DIFFICULTY.] \"No,\" replied Paganel. \"Nor to Mendoza?\" \"No.\" At this moment Glenarvan, rejoining Paganel, asked what Thalcave said,\nand why he had stopped. When he had told him, Glenarvan said,--\n\n\"Could you not explain to him the object of our expedition, and why we\nmust always proceed toward the east?\" \"That would be very difficult,\" answered Paganel, \"for an Indian\nunderstands nothing of geography.\" \"But,\" said the major seriously, \"is it the history, or the historian,\nthat he cannot understand?\" \"Ah, MacNabb,\" said Paganel, \"you still doubt my Spanish!\" \"Try, my worthy friend.\" \"Very well.\" Paganel turned to the Patagonian, and began a discourse, frequently\ninterrupted for want of words and from the difficulty of explaining to\na half-ignorant savage details which were rather incomprehensible to\nhim. The geographer was just then a curious sight. He gesticulated,\narticulated, and exerted himself in a hundred ways, while great\ndrops of sweat rolled down his face. When his tongue could no longer\nmove, his arm came to his aid. He dismounted, and traced on the\nsand a geographical map, with lines of latitude and longitude, the\ntwo oceans, and the road to Carmen. Never was professor in such\nembarrassment. Thalcave watched these manoeuvres without showing whether\nhe comprehended or not. The lesson in geography lasted more than half an hour. At last Paganel\nceased, wiped his face, which was wet with perspiration, and looked at\nthe Patagonian. \"Did he understand?\" inquired Glenarvan. \"We shall see,\" replied Paganel; \"but, if he did not, I give it up.\" [Sidenote: \"PERHAPS!\"] Thalcave did not stir. He no longer spoke. His eyes were fixed upon\nthe figures traced on the sand, which the wind was gradually effacing. [Illustration: An important road--that from Carmen to\nMendoza--distinguishable by the bones of such animals as mules, horses,\nsheep and oxen, whose remains were scattered by the birds of prey, and\nlay bleaching in the sun.] \"Well?\" asked Paganel. Thalcave did not appear to hear him. Paganel already saw an ironical\nsmile forming upon the lips of the major, and, wishing to save\nhis reputation, had begun with renewed energy his geographical\ndemonstrations, when the Patagonian stopped him with a gesture. \"You are searching for a prisoner?\" he said. \"Yes,\" replied Paganel. \"And exactly on the line from the setting to the rising sun?\" said\nThalcave, indicating by a comparison, in the Indian manner, the course\nfrom west to east. \"Yes, yes, that is it!\" \"And it is your God,\" said the Patagonian, \"who has confided to the\nwaves of the vast ocean the secrets of the prisoner?\" \"God himself.\" \"May his will be accomplished then!\" replied Thalcave, with a certain\nsolemnity. \"We will go to the east, and, if necessary, even to the sun.\" Paganel, in his exultation over his pupil, immediately translated to\nhis companions the replies of the Indian. Glenarvan requested Paganel to ask the Patagonian if he had heard\nof any strangers falling into the hands of the Indians, which was\naccordingly done. \"Perhaps,\" replied the Patagonian. As soon as this word was translated, Thalcave was surrounded by the\nseven travelers, who gazed at him with questioning looks.", "similarity": 0.6573455333709717}, {"chunk_id": 73, "text": "Paganel's avowal was followed by a general laugh, which did not\ndisconcert him at all. According to Thalcave's orders, they advanced in close ranks, and\nat evening encamped in a spacious abandoned rancho, where the chief\nCatriel generally assembled his bands of natives. From an examination\nof the ground and the absence of fresh tracks, the Patagonian knew that\nit had not been occupied for a long time. The next morning Glenarvan and his companions found themselves again\non the plain. The first estancias (vast establishments for raising\ncattle), which border upon the Tandil, were descried; but Thalcave\nresolved not to stop, but to keep straight on to Fort Independence,\nwhere he wished to obtain information, especially concerning the\nsingular condition of this abandoned country. The trees, so rare since leaving the Andes, now reappeared. The greater\npart of these have been planted since the arrival of the Europeans\non the American continent. They generally surround \"corrals,\" vast\ncattle-inclosures protected with stakes. Here thousands of cattle,\nsheep, cows, and horses, branded with the mark of the owner, graze\nand fatten, while large numbers of huge dogs keep watch. The soil is\nadmirably adapted to raising cattle, and yields an excellent fodder. The people lead the life of the shepherds of the Bible. Their flocks\nare perhaps even more numerous than those which fed on the plains of\nMesopotamia; but the family element is wanting, and the owners of the\ngreat folds of the Pampas have little to recommend themselves or their\nmanner of life. Paganel explained all these particulars to his companions, and even\nsucceeded in interesting the major. Thalcave, meanwhile, hastened their progress, as he wished to arrive\nthat evening at Fort Independence. The horses, urged on by their\nmasters, and following the example of Thaouka, dashed through the\ntall grass. They passed several farms, fortified and defended by deep\nditches. The principal house was provided with an elevated terrace,\nfrom which the inmates could fire upon the plunderers of the plain. Glenarvan might perhaps have obtained here the information that he\nsought; but it was wisest to go to the village of Tandil. They did not\nstop, therefore, and soon the feet of the horses struck the grassy\nsward of the first mountain slopes. An hour afterward the village\nappeared at the bottom of a narrow gorge crowned by the embattled walls\nof Fort Independence. [Illustration: In fact, they were a dozen young children and boys who\nwere drilling very nicely. Their uniform consisted of a striped shirt\nconfined at the waist by a leathern girdle.] CHAPTER XXI. A FALSE TRAIL. Paganel, after giving his companions a brief account of the village of\nTandil, added that they could not fail to obtain information there;\nmoreover, the fort was always garrisoned by a detachment of national\ntroops. Glenarvan, accordingly, put the horses into the stable of a\n\"fonda;\" and Paganel, the major, Robert, and he, under the guidance of\nThalcave, proceeded towards Fort Independence. After ascending the ridges of the mountains for a short time, they\narrived at the postern, rather carelessly guarded by a native sentinel. They passed without difficulty, and inferred either great negligence or\nextreme security. A few soldiers were exercising on the parade-ground\nof the fort, the oldest of whom was not more than twenty and the\nyoungest scarcely ten. In fact, they were a dozen young children and\nboys who were drilling very nicely.", "similarity": 0.604779839515686}, {"chunk_id": 38, "text": "It was still rich in amaryllis, violets,\ndate-trees, and golden-flowered cactuses. A few animals, among\nothers the ocelot, inhabited the thickets. A heron, a solitary owl,\nthrushes and snipes wary of the talons of the hawk, were the only\nrepresentatives of the feathered tribe. Of the natives few were seen; only some \"guassos\" (degenerate children\nof the Indians and Spanish), galloping on horses which they lacerated\nwith the gigantic spurs that adorned their naked feet, and passing\nlike shadows. They met on the way no one who could inform them, and\ninquiries were therefore utterly impossible. [Sidenote: AN ASTONISHED CATAPAZ.] Glenarvan thought that Captain Grant, if prisoner of the Indians, must\nhave been carried by them beyond the Andes. Their search could be\nsuccessful only in the Pampas. They must be patient, and travel on\nswiftly and continuously. [Illustration: By means of a ford, they crossed the Rio Tubal, the\nmountains visible in the distance.] They advanced in the same order as before, which Robert with difficulty\nkept, for his eagerness led him to press forward, to the great\nannoyance of his animal. Nothing but a command from Glenarvan would\nkeep the young boy at his place in the line. The country now became\nmore uneven; and several hillocks indicated that they were approaching\nthe mountains. Paganel still continued his study of Spanish. \"What a language it is!\" exclaimed he; \"so full and sonorous!\" \"But you are making progress, of course?\" replied Glenarvan. \"Certainly, my dear lord. Ah! if there were only no accent! But, alas! there is one!\" In studying this language, Paganel did not, however, neglect his\ngeographical observations. In these, indeed, he was astonishingly\nclever, and could not have found his superior. When Glenarvan\nquestioned the catapaz about some peculiarity of the country, his\nlearned companion would always anticipate the answer of the guide, who\nthen gazed at him with a look of amazement. That same day they met a road which crossed the line that they had\nhitherto pursued. Lord Glenarvan naturally asked its name of their\nguide, and Paganel as naturally answered,--\n\n\"The road from Yumbel to Los Angelos.\" Glenarvan looked at the catapaz. \"Exactly,\" replied he. Then, addressing the geographer, he said,--\n\n\"You have traveled in this country?\" \"Certainly,\" replied Paganel gravely. \"On a mule?\" \"No; in an arm-chair.\" The catapaz did not understand, for he shrugged his shoulders and\nreturned to the head of the troop. At five o'clock in the afternoon they stopped in a shallow gorge, a\nfew miles above the little town of Loja; and that night the travelers\nencamped at the foot of the first slopes of the Andes. CHAPTER XII. ELEVEN THOUSAND FEET ALOFT. The route through Chili had as yet presented no serious obstacles; but\nnow the dangers that attend a journey across the mountains suddenly\nincreased, the struggle with the natural difficulties was about to\nbegin in earnest. An important question had to be decided before starting. By what pass\ncould they cross the Andes with the least departure from the prescribed\ncourse? The catapaz was questioned on this subject. \"I know,\" he replied, \"of but two passes that are practicable in this\npart of the Andes.\" \"Doubtless the pass of Arica,\" said Paganel, \"which was discovered by\nValdivia Mendoza.\" \"Exactly.\" \"And that of Villarica, situated to the south of Nevado.\" \"You are right.\" \"Well, my friend, these two passes have only one difficulty; they will\ncarry us to the south, or the north, farther than we wish.\"", "similarity": 0.6410065293312073}, {"chunk_id": 33, "text": "So saying, Paganel spread out before them upon the table a large map of\nChili and the Argentine Provinces. \"Look,\" said he, \"and follow me in\nthis passage across the American continent.

Here Thalcave hoped\nto meet the chiefs in whose hands he doubted not that he should find\nHarry Grant and rescue him and his two companions from slavery. Since they had left the Guamini, the travelers noticed, with great\nsatisfaction, a considerable change in the temperature, thanks to the\ncold winds of Patagonia, which cause continual currents of air. Neither\nman nor beast had any reason to complain, after suffering so much from\ndryness and heat. They therefore pushed on with courage and confidence. But, whatever might have been said, the country seemed to be entirely\nuninhabited, or, to use a more exact word, \"disinhabited.\" Frequently they skirted the shores of fresh-water lagoons, on whose\nbanks, in the shelter of the bushes, tiny wrens skipped and melodious\nlarks warbled, in company with the brilliant-plumaged tanagers. These\npretty birds gayly fluttered about, heedless of the haughty starlings\nthat strutted on the banks like soldiers with their epaulettes and red\nbreasts. In the thorny coppices the nests of the annubis swung like\nhammocks, and on the shores of the lagoons magnificent flamingoes,\nmarching in regular file, spread their fiery-colored wings to the wind. Their nests were seen, by thousands together, like a small village, in\nthe shape of truncated cones a foot high. The birds were not startled\nat the approach of the travelers, which was contrary to Paganel's\ncalculations. \"I have been curious for a long time,\" said he to the major, \"to see a\nflamingo fly.\" \"Well,\" said MacNabb. \"Now, since I have an opportunity, I shall profit by it.\" \"Do so, Paganel.\" \"Come with me, major, and you too, Robert; I need witnesses.\" And Paganel, leaving his companions to go on, proceeded towards the\nflock of flamingoes, followed by Robert and the major. Arriving within\nrange, Paganel fired a blank charge (for he would not needlessly\ndestroy even a bird), and all the flamingoes flew away, while the\ngeographer gazed at them attentively through his glasses. \"Well,\" said he to the major, when the flock had disappeared, \"did you\nsee them fly?\" \"Certainly,\" replied MacNabb; \"you could not do otherwise, unless you\nwere blind. But let us hasten on, for we have fallen a mile behind.\" When he had joined his companions, Paganel found Glenarvan in excited\nconversation with the Indian, whom he did not appear to understand.

Fernand was a Spaniard, and\nbeing sent to Spain to ascertain the feeling of his fellow-countrymen,\nfound Danglars there, got on very intimate terms with him, won over the\nsupport of the royalists at the capital and in the provinces, received\npromises and made pledges on his own part, guided his regiment by paths\nknown to himself alone through the mountain gorges which were held by\nthe royalists, and, in fact, rendered such services in this brief\ncampaign that, after the taking of Trocadero, he was made colonel, and\nreceived the title of count and the cross of an officer of the Legion\nof Honor.”\n\n“Destiny! destiny!” murmured the abbé. “Yes, but listen: this was not all. The war with Spain being ended,\nFernand’s career was checked by the long peace which seemed likely to\nendure throughout Europe. Greece only had risen against Turkey, and had\nbegun her war of independence; all eyes were turned towards Athens—it\nwas the fashion to pity and support the Greeks. The French government,\nwithout protecting them openly, as you know, gave countenance to\nvolunteer assistance. Fernand sought and obtained leave to go and serve\nin Greece, still having his name kept on the army roll. 0345m\n\n\n\nSome time after, it was stated that the Comte de Morcerf (this was the\nname he bore) had entered the service of Ali Pasha with the rank of\ninstructor-general.

But I have seen things so extraordinary, that what you tell\nme seems less astonishing than it otherwise might.”\n\n“Mercédès was at first in the deepest despair at the blow which\ndeprived her of Edmond.

Still, it\nmust have been many years in use, for it was thickly covered with a\ncoating of soot; this soot I dissolved in a portion of the wine brought\nto me every Sunday, and I assure you a better ink cannot be desired. For very important notes, for which closer attention is required, I\npricked one of my fingers, and wrote with my own blood.”\n\n“And when,” asked Dantès, “may I see all this?”\n\n“Whenever you please,” replied the abbé. “Oh, then let it be directly!” exclaimed the young man. “Follow me, then,” said the abbé, as he re-entered the subterranean\npassage, in which he soon disappeared, followed by Dantès. Chapter 17. The Abbé’s Chamber\n\nAfter having passed with tolerable ease through the subterranean\npassage, which, however, did not admit of their holding themselves\nerect, the two friends reached the further end of the corridor, into\nwhich the abbé’s cell opened; from that point the passage became much\nnarrower, and barely permitted one to creep through on hands and knees. The floor of the abbé’s cell was paved, and it had been by raising one\nof the stones in the most obscure corner that Faria had been able to\ncommence the laborious task of which Dantès had witnessed the\ncompletion. As he entered the chamber of his friend, Dantès cast around one eager\nand searching glance in quest of the expected marvels, but nothing more\nthan common met his view. “It is well,” said the abbé; “we have some hours before us—it is now\njust a quarter past twelve o’clock.” Instinctively Dantès turned round\nto observe by what watch or clock the abbé had been able so accurately\nto specify the hour. “Look at this ray of light which enters by my window,” said the abbé,\n“and then observe the lines traced on the wall. Well, by means of these\nlines, which are in accordance with the double motion of the earth, and\nthe ellipse it describes round the sun, I am enabled to ascertain the\nprecise hour with more minuteness than if I possessed a watch; for that\nmight be broken or deranged in its movements, while the sun and earth\nnever vary in their appointed paths.”\n\nThis last explanation was wholly lost upon Dantès, who had always\nimagined, from seeing the sun rise from behind the mountains and set in\nthe Mediterranean, that it moved, and not the earth. A double movement\nof the globe he inhabited, and of which he could feel nothing, appeared\nto him perfectly impossible.

Fortunately, I\nwas so well concealed that he could not find me. Then he became\nalarmed, and dared not stay any longer at Nîmes, so he solicited a\nchange of residence, and, as he was in reality very influential, he was\nnominated to Versailles. But, as you know, a Corsican who has sworn to\navenge himself cares not for distance, so his carriage, fast as it\nwent, was never above half a day’s journey before me, who followed him\non foot. The most important thing was, not to kill him only—for I had\nan opportunity of doing so a hundred times—but to kill him without\nbeing discovered—at least, without being arrested. I no longer belonged\nto myself, for I had my sister-in-law to protect and provide for. “For three months I watched M. de Villefort, for three months he took\nnot a step out-of-doors without my following him. At length I\ndiscovered that he went mysteriously to Auteuil. I followed him\nthither, and I saw him enter the house where we now are, only, instead\nof entering by the great door that looks into the street, he came on\nhorseback, or in his carriage, left the one or the other at the little\ninn, and entered by the gate you see there.”\n\nMonte Cristo made a sign with his head to show that he could discern in\nthe darkness the door to which Bertuccio alluded. “As I had nothing more to do at Versailles, I went to Auteuil, and\ngained all the information I could. If I wished to surprise him, it was\nevident this was the spot to lie in wait for him. The house belonged,\nas the concierge informed your excellency, to M. de Saint-Méran,\nVillefort’s father-in-law. M. de Saint-Méran lived at Marseilles, so\nthat this country house was useless to him, and it was reported to be\nlet to a young widow, known only by the name of ‘the Baroness.’\n\n“One evening, as I was looking over the wall, I saw a young and\nhandsome woman who was walking alone in that garden, which was not\noverlooked by any windows, and I guessed that she was awaiting M. de\nVillefort. When she was sufficiently near for me to distinguish her\nfeatures, I saw she was from eighteen to nineteen, tall and very fair. As she had a loose muslin dress on and as nothing concealed her figure,\nI saw she would ere long become a mother. A few moments after, the\nlittle door was opened and a man entered. The young woman hastened to\nmeet him. They threw themselves into each other’s arms, embraced\ntenderly, and returned together to the house.

Behind the head of the bed, and concealed by a stone fitting\nin so closely as to defy all suspicion, was a hollow space, and in this\nspace a ladder of cords between twenty-five and thirty feet in length.

Nevertheless, I\ncarefully preserved my ladder against one of those unforeseen\nopportunities of which I spoke just now, and which sudden chance\nfrequently brings about.”\n\nWhile affecting to be deeply engaged in examining the ladder, the mind\nof Dantès was, in fact, busily occupied by the idea that a person so\nintelligent, ingenious, and clear-sighted as the abbé might probably be\nable to solve the dark mystery of his own misfortunes, where he himself\ncould see nothing. “What are you thinking of?” asked the abbé smilingly, imputing the deep\nabstraction in which his visitor was plunged to the excess of his awe\nand wonder.", "similarity": 0.4525548219680786}, {"chunk_id": 403, "text": "Her attitude, though perfectly\nnatural for an Eastern woman would, in a European, have been deemed too\nfull of coquettish straining after effect.

But how could he find his\nway in the darkness of the night? At this moment he saw the light of Planier, gleaming in front of him\nlike a star.

The guests were still at table, and the heated and energetic\nconversation that prevailed betrayed the violent and vindictive\npassions that then agitated each dweller of the South, where unhappily,\nfor five centuries religious strife had long given increased bitterness\nto the violence of party feeling. The emperor, now king of the petty Island of Elba, after having held\nsovereign sway over one-half of the world, counting as his subjects a\nsmall population of five or six thousand souls,—after having been\naccustomed to hear the “_Vive Napoléons_” of a hundred and twenty\nmillions of human beings, uttered in ten different languages,—was\nlooked upon here as a ruined man, separated forever from any fresh\nconnection with France or claim to her throne.

Napoleon would, doubtless, have deprived Villefort of his office had it\nnot been for Noirtier, who was all powerful at court, and thus the\nGirondin of ’93 and the Senator of 1806 protected him who so lately had\nbeen his protector.

Villefort retained his place, but his marriage was put off until a more\nfavorable opportunity.

He took the boy in his arms, lifted him from his horse, and gazed at\nhim with the most curious sympathy. His intelligent countenance became\nsuffused with a peaceful emotion. But Paganel had not finished his inquiries. Where was this prisoner? What was he doing? When had Thalcave heard of him? All these questions\nthronged his mind at once. He did not have to wait long for answers,\nbut learnt that the European was a slave of one of the Indian tribes\nthat scour the plains. \"But where was he last?\" asked Paganel. \"With the cazique Calfoucoura,\" answered Thalcave. \"On the line we have been following?\" \"Yes.\" \"And who is this cazique?\" \"The chief of the Poyuches Indians; a man with two tongues and two\nhearts.\" [Sidenote: A SCIENTIFIC BATH.] \"That is to say, false in word and in deed,\" said Paganel, after\ntranslating to his companions this beautiful metaphor of the Indian\nlanguage. \"And can we rescue our friend?\" he added. \"Perhaps so, if your friend is still in the hands of the Indians.\" \"And when did you hear of him?\" \"A long time ago, and, since then, the sun has brought back two summers\nto the sky.\" Glenarvan's joy could not be described. This answer coincided exactly\nwith the date of the document. But one question remained to be asked. \"You speak of a prisoner,\" said Paganel; \"but were there not three?\" \"I do not know,\" replied Thalcave. \"And you know nothing of their actual situation?\" \"Nothing.\" This last word ended the conversation. It was possible that the three\nprisoners had been separated a long time. But the substance of the\nPatagonian's information was that the Indians spoke of a European who\nhad fallen into their power. The date of his captivity, the place where\nhe must have been, everything, even to the Patagonian phrase used to\nexpress his courage, related evidently to Captain Harry Grant. Their progress was now somewhat slow and difficult; their next object\nbeing to reach and cross the river Colorado, to which at length\ntheir horses brought them. Here Paganel's first care was to bathe\n\"geographically\" in its waters, which are colored by a reddish clay.

Then mud, lava, and volcanic fragments mingled in the scene of\ndevastation. Torrents of flame furrowed the sides of the Maunganamu. The adjoining mountains glowed in the light of the eruption, and the\ndeep valleys were illumined with a vivid brightness. The savages were soon aroused, both by the noise and the heat\nof the lava that flowed in a scalding tide through the midst of\ntheir encampment. Those whom the fiery flood had not reached fled,\nand ascended the surrounding hills, turning and gazing back at\nthis terrific phenomenon, with which their god, in his wrath, had\noverwhelmed the desecrators of the sacred mountain; while at certain\nmoments they were heard howling their consecratory cry:\n\n\"Taboo! taboo! taboo!\" [Illustration: The fugitives made themselves levers out of the stakes\nof the tomb.] [Illustration: An incandescent column poured forth towards the sky with\nloud explosions, while streams of boiling water and lava rolled towards\nthe encampment of the natives.] Meantime an enormous quantity of vapor, melted stones, and lava had\nescaped from the crater.

All this\nvolcanic effervescence had hitherto been confined beneath the crust of\nthe peak, since the outlets of Tangariro sufficed for its expansion;\nbut as a new opening had been made, it had rushed forth with extreme\nviolence. All night long, during the storm that raged above and below, the peak\nwas shaken with a commotion that could not but alarm Glenarvan. The\nprisoners, concealed behind the palisade of the tomb, watched the\nfearful progress of the outbreak. Morning came. The fury of the volcano had not moderated. Thick,\nyellowish vapors mingled with the flames, and torrents of lava poured\nin every direction. Glenarvan, with eye alert and beating heart,\nglanced between the interstices of the inclosure, and surveyed the camp\nof the Maoris. The natives had fled to the neighboring plateaus, beyond the reach of\nthe volcano. Several corpses, lying at the foot of the peak, had been\ncharred by the fire. Farther on, towards the pah, the lava had consumed\na number of huts, that were still smoking. The savages, in scattered\ngroups, were gazing at the vapory summit of Maunganamu with religious\nawe. Kai-Koumou came into the midst of his warriors, and Glenarvan\nrecognized him. The chief advanced to the base of the peak, on the side\nspared by the eruption, but did not cross the first slopes. Here, with\noutstretched arms, like a sorcerer exorcising, he made a few grimaces,\nthe meaning of which did not escape the prisoners. As Paganel had\nforeseen, Kai-Koumou was invoking upon the mountain a more rigorous\ntaboo. Soon after, the natives descended, in single file, the winding paths\nthat led towards the pah.

They owed him too\nmuch not to obey him, and they accordingly resumed their journey. The rain had ceased, but the hard earth held what had fallen. On the\nimpenetrable clay, pools, marshes, and ponds overflowed and formed\nimmense \"bañados\" of treacherous depth. Paganel, on consulting his map,\njudged rightly that the Grande and Nivarota Rivers, into which the\nwaters of the plain usually flow, must have mingled together in one\nbroad stream. An extremely rapid advance, therefore, became necessary. The common\nsafety was at stake. If the inundation increased, where could they find\na refuge? The vast circle of the horizon did not offer a single point,\nand on this level plain the progress of the water must be rapid. The\nhorses were urged to their utmost speed.

However feeble he was still, not one of these good people could refrain\nfrom pressing him to his heart. But it must be confessed that these\nwell-meant embraces are not fatal, for the boy did not die. When his rescue was certain, thought reverted to his rescuer, and the\nmajor very naturally thought of looking around him. Fifty paces from\nthe stream, a man of lofty stature was standing, motionless, on one\nof the first ledges of the mountain. A long gun lay at his feet. This\nindividual, who had so suddenly appeared, had broad shoulders, and\nlong hair tied with leathern thongs. His height exceeded six feet, and\nhis bronzed face was red between his eyes and mouth, black below his\neyelids, and white on his forehead. After the manner of the Patagonians\nof the frontiers, the native wore a splendid cloak, decorated with\nred arabesques, made of the skin of a guanaco, its silky fur turned\noutward, and sewed with ostrich-tendons. Under his cloak a tippet of\nfox-skin encircled his neck and terminated in a point in front. At his\ngirdle hung a little bag containing the colors with which he painted\nhis face. His leggings were of ox-hide, and fastened to the ankle with\nstraps regularly crossed. The figure of this Patagonian was fine, and his face denoted real\nintelligence in spite of the colors that adorned (!) it. He waited in\nan attitude full of dignity, and, seeing him so motionless and stern on\nhis pedestal of rocks, you would have taken him for a statue. The major, as soon as he perceived him, pointed him out to Glenarvan,\nwho hastened towards him. The Patagonian took two steps forward;\nGlenarvan took his hand, and pressed it. There was in the latter's\nlook, in his physiognomy, such a feeling, such an expression of\ngratitude, that the native could not mistake it. He inclined his head\ngently, and uttered a few words that neither the major nor his friend\ncould understand. The Patagonian, after regarding the strangers attentively, now changed\nthe language; but whatever it was, this new idiom was no better\nunderstood than the first. However, certain expressions which he used\nstruck Glenarvan. They seemed to belong to the Spanish language, of\nwhich he knew several common words. \"Spanish?\" said he. The Patagonian nodded. \"Well,\" said the major, \"this is our friend Paganel's business. It is\nfortunate that he thought of learning Spanish.\" Paganel was called. He came at once and with all the grace of a\nFrenchman saluted the Patagonian, to which the latter paid no\nattention. The geographer was informed of the state of affairs, and was\nonly too glad to use his diligently-acquired knowledge. [Sidenote: SOMETHING WRONG.] \"Exactly,\" said he.

Manuel did not think of any other calling than that of the\nsoldier, and hoped, in time, with the help of God, to offer to the\nrepublic a whole battalion of young soldiers. \"You have seen them?\" said he. \"Charming fellows! Good soldiers! José! Juan! Miguel! Pepe! Pepe is only seven years old, and is already biting\nhis cartridge!\" Pepe, hearing himself complimented, joined his two little feet, and\npresented arms with perfect precision. \"He will do!\" added the sergeant. \"He will be a major--or\nbrigadier-general one day!\" This story lasted a quarter of an hour, to Thalcave's great\nastonishment. The Indian could not understand how so many words could\ncome from a single throat. No one interrupted the commander; and even\na French sergeant had to conclude at last, though not without forcing\nhis guests to accompany him to his dwelling. Here they were introduced\nto Madame Ipharaguerre, who appeared to be \"a good-looking person,\" if\nthis expression may be employed in regard to an Indian. When he had exhausted himself, the sergeant asked his guests to what he\nowed the honor of their visit. And now it was their turn to explain. Paganel, opening the conversation in French, told him of their journey\nacross the Pampas, and ended by asking why the Indians had abandoned\nthe country. \"War!\" replied the sergeant. \"War?\" \"Yes, civil war.\" \"Civil war?\" rejoined Paganel. \"Yes, war between Paraguay and Buenos Ayres,\" answered the sergeant. \"Well?\" \"Why, all the Indians of the north are in the rear of General Flores,\nand those of the plains are plundering.\" \"But the caziques?\" \"The caziques with them.\" This answer was reported to Thalcave, who shook his head. Indeed,\nhe either did not know, or had forgotten, that a civil war, which\nwas afterwards to involve Brazil, was decimating two-thirds of the\nrepublic. The Indians had everything to gain in these internal\nstruggles, and could not neglect such fine opportunities for plunder. The sergeant, therefore, was not mistaken in attributing this desertion\nof the Pampas to the civil war that was being waged in the northern\npart of the Argentine Provinces. But this event disconcerted Glenarvan's hopes. If Captain Grant was\na prisoner of the caziques, he must have been carried by them to the\nnorthern frontiers. Yet how and where to find him?

Fortunately, Ayrton had lost neither his time nor his trouble. The\nnext morning he reappeared at break of day. A man accompanied him, by\nprofession a farrier. He was a tall, stout fellow, but of a low and\nbrutish appearance, which did not prepossess one in his favor. However,\nthis was of little importance, if he knew his business. At all events\nhis breath was not wasted in idle words. \"Is he an efficient workman?\" inquired Captain Mangles of the\nquartermaster. \"I know no more than you, captain,\" replied Ayrton. \"We shall see.\" The farrier began his work. He was a man who understood his trade, as\none could see by the way in which he repaired the wheels of the cart. He labored skillfully and with uncommon energy. During the operation, the major noticed that the farrier's wrists were\nconsiderably eroded, and that they were each encircled by a blackish\nring of extravasated blood. These were the marks of recent wounds,\nwhich the sleeves of a miserable woolen shirt but partially concealed. MacNabb questioned the man about these erosions, which must have been\nvery painful. He, however, made no reply, but stolidly kept on at his\nwork. Two hours after, the injuries of the cart were repaired. As for\nGlenarvan's horse, he was quickly shod. The farrier had taken care to\nbring shoes all prepared. There was a peculiarity about them, however,\nwhich did not escape the major. It was a trefoil rudely carved on the\nouter rim.

Under his cloak a tippet of\nfox-skin encircled his neck and terminated in a point in front. At his\ngirdle hung a little bag containing the colors with which he painted\nhis face. His leggings were of ox-hide, and fastened to the ankle with\nstraps regularly crossed.

The major, as soon as he perceived him, pointed him out to Glenarvan,\nwho hastened towards him. The Patagonian took two steps forward;\nGlenarvan took his hand, and pressed it. There was in the latter's\nlook, in his physiognomy, such a feeling, such an expression of\ngratitude, that the native could not mistake it. He inclined his head\ngently, and uttered a few words that neither the major nor his friend\ncould understand.

The Patagonian nodded. \"Well,\" said the major, \"this is our friend Paganel's business. It is\nfortunate that he thought of learning Spanish.\" Paganel was called. He came at once and with all the grace of a\nFrenchman saluted the Patagonian, to which the latter paid no\nattention.

Every word the\nPatagonian said he repeated in English, so that his companions heard\nthe Indian speak, as it were, in their own language. \"And this prisoner?\" inquired Paganel. \"He was a stranger,\" replied Thalcave slowly; \"a European.\" \"You have seen him?\" \"No, but he is mentioned in the accounts of the Indians.

It was possible that the three\nprisoners had been separated a long time. But the substance of the\nPatagonian's information was that the Indians spoke of a European who\nhad fallen into their power. The date of his captivity, the place where\nhe must have been, everything, even to the Patagonian phrase used to\nexpress his courage, related evidently to Captain Harry Grant.

But bear in mind, that should\nthere fall in your way anyone guilty of conspiring against the\ngovernment, you will be so much the more bound to visit the offence\nwith rigorous punishment, as it is known you belong to a suspected\nfamily.”\n\n“Alas, madame,” returned Villefort, “my profession, as well as the\ntimes in which we live, compels me to be severe.

As Villefort observes, it is a great act of folly\nto have left such a man between Corsica, where he was born, and Naples,\nof which his brother-in-law is king, and face to face with Italy, the\nsovereignty of which he coveted for his son.”\n\n“Unfortunately,” said Villefort, “there are the treaties of 1814, and\nwe cannot molest Napoleon without breaking those compacts.”\n\n“Oh, well, we shall find some way out of it,” responded M. de Salvieux. “There wasn’t any trouble over treaties when it was a question of\nshooting the poor Duc d’Enghien.”\n\n“Well,” said the marquise, “it seems probable that, by the aid of the\nHoly Alliance, we shall be rid of Napoleon; and we must trust to the\nvigilance of M. de Villefort to purify Marseilles of his partisans.", "similarity": 0.4835115671157837}, {"chunk_id": 718, "text": "Go and tell M.

After\nnumberless windings, Dantès saw a door with an iron wicket. The\ncommissary took up an iron mallet and knocked thrice, every blow\nseeming to Dantès as if struck on his heart. The door opened, the two\ngendarmes gently pushed him forward, and the door closed with a loud\nsound behind him. The air he inhaled was no longer pure, but thick and\nmephitic,—he was in prison. He was conducted to a tolerably neat chamber, but grated and barred,\nand its appearance, therefore, did not greatly alarm him; besides, the\nwords of Villefort, who seemed to interest himself so much, resounded\nstill in his ears like a promise of freedom. It was four o’clock when\nDantès was placed in this chamber. It was, as we have said, the 1st of\nMarch, and the prisoner was soon buried in darkness. The obscurity\naugmented the acuteness of his hearing; at the slightest sound he rose\nand hastened to the door, convinced they were about to liberate him,\nbut the sound died away, and Dantès sank again into his seat. At last,\nabout ten o’clock, and just as Dantès began to despair, steps were\nheard in the corridor, a key turned in the lock, the bolts creaked, the\nmassy oaken door flew open, and a flood of light from two torches\npervaded the apartment. By the torchlight Dantès saw the glittering sabres and carbines of four\ngendarmes. He had advanced at first, but stopped at the sight of this\ndisplay of force. “Are you come to fetch me?” asked he. “Yes,” replied a gendarme. “By the orders of the deputy procureur?”\n\n“I believe so.” The conviction that they came from M. de Villefort\nrelieved all Dantès’ apprehensions; he advanced calmly, and placed\nhimself in the centre of the escort.", "similarity": 0.5535862445831299}, {"chunk_id": 64, "text": "This person, a sailor, of turbulent character,\nand whom I suspected of Bonapartism, has been secretly to the Island of\nElba.

He remained in his cell, and\nthis visit only increased the belief in his insanity. Caligula or Nero, those treasure-seekers, those desirers of the\nimpossible, would have accorded to the poor wretch, in exchange for his\nwealth, the liberty he so earnestly prayed for. But the kings of modern\ntimes, restrained by the limits of mere probability, have neither\ncourage nor desire. They fear the ear that hears their orders, and the\neye that scrutinizes their actions. Formerly they believed themselves\nsprung from Jupiter, and shielded by their birth; but nowadays they are\nnot inviolable. It has always been against the policy of despotic governments to suffer\nthe victims of their persecutions to reappear. As the Inquisition\nrarely allowed its victims to be seen with their limbs distorted and\ntheir flesh lacerated by torture, so madness is always concealed in its\ncell, from whence, should it depart, it is conveyed to some gloomy\nhospital, where the doctor has no thought for man or mind in the\nmutilated being the jailer delivers to him. The very madness of the\nAbbé Faria, gone mad in prison, condemned him to perpetual captivity. The inspector kept his word with Dantès; he examined the register, and\nfound the following note concerning him:\n\n_Edmond Dantès:_\n\nViolent Bonapartist; took an active part in the return from Elba. The greatest watchfulness and care to be exercised. This note was in a different hand from the rest, which showed that it\nhad been added since his confinement. The inspector could not contend\nagainst this accusation; he simply wrote, _Nothing to be done._\n\nThis visit had infused new vigor into Dantès; he had, till then,\nforgotten the date; but now, with a fragment of plaster, he wrote the\ndate, 30th July, 1816, and made a mark every day, in order not to lose\nhis reckoning again. Days and weeks passed away, then months—Dantès\nstill waited; he at first expected to be freed in a fortnight. This\nfortnight expired, he decided that the inspector would do nothing until\nhis return to Paris, and that he would not reach there until his\ncircuit was finished, he therefore fixed three months; three months\npassed away, then six more. Finally ten months and a half had gone by\nand no favorable change had taken place, and Dantès began to fancy the\ninspector’s visit but a dream, an illusion of the brain. At the expiration of a year the governor was transferred; he had\nobtained charge of the fortress at Ham. He took with him several of his\nsubordinates, and amongst them Dantès’ jailer. A new governor arrived;\nit would have been too tedious to acquire the names of the prisoners;\nhe learned their numbers instead. This horrible place contained fifty\ncells; their inhabitants were designated by the numbers of their cell,\nand the unhappy young man was no longer called Edmond Dantès—he was now\nnumber 34. Chapter 15. Number 34 and Number 27\n\nDantès passed through all the stages of torture natural to prisoners in\nsuspense. He was sustained at first by that pride of conscious\ninnocence which is the sequence to hope; then he began to doubt his own\ninnocence, which justified in some measure the governor’s belief in his\nmental alienation; and then, relaxing his sentiment of pride, he\naddressed his supplications, not to God, but to man.

But, as you know, a Corsican who has sworn to\navenge himself cares not for distance, so his carriage, fast as it\nwent, was never above half a day’s journey before me, who followed him\non foot.

When she was sufficiently near for me to distinguish her\nfeatures, I saw she was from eighteen to nineteen, tall and very fair. As she had a loose muslin dress on and as nothing concealed her figure,\nI saw she would ere long become a mother. A few moments after, the\nlittle door was opened and a man entered. The young woman hastened to\nmeet him. They threw themselves into each other’s arms, embraced\ntenderly, and returned together to the house.

The count seized it hastily, his eyes immediately fell upon the\nepigraph, and he read:\n\n“Thou shalt tear out the dragons’ teeth, and shall trample the lions\nunder foot, saith the Lord.”\n\n“Ah,” he exclaimed, “here is my answer.

On landing, the count turned towards the cemetery, where he felt sure\nof finding Morrel. He, too, ten years ago, had piously sought out a\ntomb, and sought it vainly. He, who returned to France with millions,\nhad been unable to find the grave of his father, who had perished from\nhunger. Morrel had indeed placed a cross over the spot, but it had\nfallen down and the grave-digger had burnt it, as he did all the old\nwood in the churchyard. The worthy merchant had been more fortunate. Dying in the arms of his\nchildren, he had been by them laid by the side of his wife, who had\npreceded him in eternity by two years. Two large slabs of marble, on\nwhich were inscribed their names, were placed on either side of a\nlittle enclosure, railed in, and shaded by four cypress-trees.

This person, a sailor, of turbulent character,\nand whom I suspected of Bonapartism, has been secretly to the Island of\nElba. There he saw the grand-marshal, who charged him with an oral\nmessage to a Bonapartist in Paris, whose name I could not extract from\nhim; but this mission was to prepare men’s minds for a return (it is\nthe man who says this, sire)—a return which will soon occur.”\n\n“And where is this man?”\n\n“In prison, sire.”\n\n“And the matter seems serious to you?”\n\n“So serious, sire, that when the circumstance surprised me in the midst\nof a family festival, on the very day of my betrothal, I left my bride\nand friends, postponing everything, that I might hasten to lay at your\nmajesty’s feet the fears which impressed me, and the assurance of my\ndevotion.”\n\n“True,” said Louis XVIII., “was there not a marriage engagement between\nyou and Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran?”\n\n“Daughter of one of your majesty’s most faithful servants.”\n\n“Yes, yes; but let us talk of this plot, M. de Villefort.”\n\n“Sire, I fear it is more than a plot; I fear it is a conspiracy.”\n\n“A conspiracy in these times,” said Louis XVIII., smiling, “is a thing\nvery easy to meditate, but more difficult to conduct to an end,\ninasmuch as, re-established so recently on the throne of our ancestors,\nwe have our eyes open at once upon the past, the present, and the\nfuture.", "similarity": 0.5678423643112183}, {"chunk_id": 596, "text": "It would be conceding too much to allow you to put on a mask to aid you\nin the discovery of our secret, and then to remove it that you may ruin\nthose who have confided in you.

The chief, whose name was \"Hihy\" (sunbeam), was not a bad man. The\nspectacles and telescope gave him a high opinion of Paganel, whom he\nattached carefully to his person, not only by his benefits, but by\nstrong flaxen ropes, especially at night. This novel situation lasted three long days. Was he well or badly\ntreated? Both, as he stated without further explanation. In short, he\nwas a prisoner, and, except for the prospect of immediate torture,\nhis condition did not seem more enviable than that of his unfortunate\nfriends. Fortunately, last night he succeeded in biting asunder his ropes and\nescaping. He had witnessed at a distance the burial of the chief,\nknew that he had been interred on the summit of Maunganamu mountain,\nand that it was tabooed in consequence. He therefore resolved to take\nrefuge there, not wishing to leave the place where his companions were\nheld captives. He succeeded in his undertaking, arrived at Kara-Tété's\ntomb, and waited in hope that Providence would in some way deliver his\nfriends. Such was Paganel's story. Did he omit designedly any circumstance\nof his stay among the natives? More than once his embarrassment led\nthem to suspect so. However that might be, he received unanimous\ncongratulations; and as the past was now known, they returned to the\npresent. Their situation was still exceedingly critical. The natives, if they\ndid not venture to climb the mountain, expected that hunger and thirst\nwould force their prisoners to surrender. It was only a matter of time,\nand the savages had great patience. Glenarvan did not disregard the\ndifficulties of his position, but waited for the favorable issue which\nProvidence seemed to promise. And first he wished to examine this improvised fortress; not to defend\nit, for an attack was not to be feared, but that he might find a way of\nescaping. The major and the captain, Robert, Paganel, and himself, took\nthe exact bearings of the mountain. They observed the direction of the\npaths, their branches and declivities. A ridge a mile in length united\nthe Maunganamu to the Wahiti range, and then declined to the plain. Its\nnarrow and winding summit presented the only practicable route, in case\nescape should become possible. If the fugitives could pass this point\nunperceived, under cover of the night, perhaps they might succeed in\nreaching the deep valleys and outwitting the Maoris. But this course offered more than one danger, as they would have to\npass below within gun-shot. The bullets of the natives on the lower\nramparts of the pah might intercept them, and form a barrier that no\none could safely cross.

Is it not\na mere joke? Have I done this? It is the confusion of languages, as at\nBabel.

He kept repeating\nthose fatal words: \"The Duncan! the Duncan!\" He could find no others\nin his vocabulary. He went to and fro, examining the rigging of the\nyacht, and questioning the mute horizon of the open sea. At last he\nreturned to Lord Glenarvan.

The chief, whose name was \"Hihy\" (sunbeam), was not a bad man. The\nspectacles and telescope gave him a high opinion of Paganel, whom he\nattached carefully to his person, not only by his benefits, but by\nstrong flaxen ropes, especially at night. This novel situation lasted three long days. Was he well or badly\ntreated? Both, as he stated without further explanation. In short, he\nwas a prisoner, and, except for the prospect of immediate torture,\nhis condition did not seem more enviable than that of his unfortunate\nfriends. Fortunately, last night he succeeded in biting asunder his ropes and\nescaping. He had witnessed at a distance the burial of the chief,\nknew that he had been interred on the summit of Maunganamu mountain,\nand that it was tabooed in consequence. He therefore resolved to take\nrefuge there, not wishing to leave the place where his companions were\nheld captives. He succeeded in his undertaking, arrived at Kara-Tété's\ntomb, and waited in hope that Providence would in some way deliver his\nfriends. Such was Paganel's story. Did he omit designedly any circumstance\nof his stay among the natives? More than once his embarrassment led\nthem to suspect so. However that might be, he received unanimous\ncongratulations; and as the past was now known, they returned to the\npresent. Their situation was still exceedingly critical. The natives, if they\ndid not venture to climb the mountain, expected that hunger and thirst\nwould force their prisoners to surrender. It was only a matter of time,\nand the savages had great patience. Glenarvan did not disregard the\ndifficulties of his position, but waited for the favorable issue which\nProvidence seemed to promise. And first he wished to examine this improvised fortress; not to defend\nit, for an attack was not to be feared, but that he might find a way of\nescaping. The major and the captain, Robert, Paganel, and himself, took\nthe exact bearings of the mountain. They observed the direction of the\npaths, their branches and declivities. A ridge a mile in length united\nthe Maunganamu to the Wahiti range, and then declined to the plain. Its\nnarrow and winding summit presented the only practicable route, in case\nescape should become possible. If the fugitives could pass this point\nunperceived, under cover of the night, perhaps they might succeed in\nreaching the deep valleys and outwitting the Maoris. But this course offered more than one danger, as they would have to\npass below within gun-shot. The bullets of the natives on the lower\nramparts of the pah might intercept them, and form a barrier that no\none could safely cross. Glenarvan and his friends, as soon as they ventured on the dangerous\npart of the ridge, were saluted with a volley of shots; but only a\nfew wads, borne by the wind, reached them.

He seemingly\nexpected it, and began to smile. \"My dear Glenarvan,\" said he, \"do not be too hasty in your triumph. I am going to defeat you completely, as no Englishman has ever been\ndefeated.\" \"I ask nothing better. Defeat me, Paganel.\" \"Listen, then. You say that the Indians mentioned in the document\nbelong exclusively to Patagonia. The incomplete word _indi_ does not\nmean Indians, but natives (_indigènes_). Now do you admit that there\nare natives in Australia?\" It must be confessed that Glenarvan now gazed fixedly at Paganel. \"Bravo, Paganel!\" said the major. \"Do you admit my interpretation, my dear lord?\" \"Yes,\" replied Glenarvan, \"if you can prove to me that the imperfect\nword _gonie_ does not relate to the country of the Patagonians.\" \"No,\" cried Paganel, \"it certainly does not mean Patagonia.

I shall not even search for what it may signify.

Austin, the sailors, the major, and Robert especially, were\ndelighted to revive their hopes, and applauded the worthy geographer.

The Frenchman, mistaking the vessel, had embarked while the crew of\nthe Duncan were engaged in the ceremony at Saint Mungo. Everything was\nexplained. But what would the geographer say, when he learned the name\nand destination of the vessel on which he had taken passage? \"So, Monsieur Paganel,\" said Glenarvan, \"you have chosen Calcutta as\nyour centre of action?\" \"Yes, my lord. To see India is an idea that I have cherished all my\nlife.

When he had told him, Glenarvan said,--\n\n\"Could you not explain to him the object of our expedition, and why we\nmust always proceed toward the east?\" \"That would be very difficult,\" answered Paganel, \"for an Indian\nunderstands nothing of geography.\" \"But,\" said the major seriously, \"is it the history, or the historian,\nthat he cannot understand?\" \"Ah, MacNabb,\" said Paganel, \"you still doubt my Spanish!\" \"Try, my worthy friend.\" \"Very well.\" Paganel turned to the Patagonian, and began a discourse, frequently\ninterrupted for want of words and from the difficulty of explaining to\na half-ignorant savage details which were rather incomprehensible to\nhim. The geographer was just then a curious sight. He gesticulated,\narticulated, and exerted himself in a hundred ways, while great\ndrops of sweat rolled down his face. When his tongue could no longer\nmove, his arm came to his aid. He dismounted, and traced on the\nsand a geographical map, with lines of latitude and longitude, the\ntwo oceans, and the road to Carmen. Never was professor in such\nembarrassment. Thalcave watched these manoeuvres without showing whether\nhe comprehended or not. The lesson in geography lasted more than half an hour. At last Paganel\nceased, wiped his face, which was wet with perspiration, and looked at\nthe Patagonian. \"Did he understand?\" inquired Glenarvan. \"We shall see,\" replied Paganel; \"but, if he did not, I give it up.\" [Sidenote: \"PERHAPS!\"] Thalcave did not stir. He no longer spoke. His eyes were fixed upon\nthe figures traced on the sand, which the wind was gradually effacing. [Illustration: An important road--that from Carmen to\nMendoza--distinguishable by the bones of such animals as mules, horses,\nsheep and oxen, whose remains were scattered by the birds of prey, and\nlay bleaching in the sun.] \"Well?\" asked Paganel. Thalcave did not appear to hear him. Paganel already saw an ironical\nsmile forming upon the lips of the major, and, wishing to save\nhis reputation, had begun with renewed energy his geographical\ndemonstrations, when the Patagonian stopped him with a gesture. \"You are searching for a prisoner?\" he said. \"Yes,\" replied Paganel. \"And exactly on the line from the setting to the rising sun?\" said\nThalcave, indicating by a comparison, in the Indian manner, the course\nfrom west to east. \"Yes, yes, that is it!\" \"And it is your God,\" said the Patagonian, \"who has confided to the\nwaves of the vast ocean the secrets of the prisoner?\" \"God himself.\" \"May his will be accomplished then!\" replied Thalcave, with a certain\nsolemnity. \"We will go to the east, and, if necessary, even to the sun.\" Paganel, in his exultation over his pupil, immediately translated to\nhis companions the replies of the Indian. Glenarvan requested Paganel to ask the Patagonian if he had heard\nof any strangers falling into the hands of the Indians, which was\naccordingly done. \"Perhaps,\" replied the Patagonian. As soon as this word was translated, Thalcave was surrounded by the\nseven travelers, who gazed at him with questioning looks.", "similarity": 0.4280608296394348}, {"chunk_id": 94, "text": "\"I like a fine\nspectacle, especially when I cannot avoid it.

Ah,\nit is beginning!\" [Sidenote: AN EXTRAORDINARY STORM.] Violent thunder-claps interrupted this conversation, and their\nintensity increased till they reached the most deafening peals. They soon became sonorous, and made the atmosphere vibrate in rapid\noscillations. The firmament was on fire, and during this commotion\nit was impossible to distinguish from what electric spark emanated\nthe indefinitely-prolonged rumblings that reverberated throughout the\nabysses of the sky. The incessant flashes assumed various forms. Some, darting\nperpendicularly towards the earth, were repeated five or six times in\nthe same place; others, separating into a thousand different branches,\nspread in zigzag lines and produced on the dark vault of the heavens\nastonishing jets of arborescent flame. Soon the sky, from east to\nnorth, was crossed by a phosphorescent band of intense brilliancy. This\nillumination gradually overspread the entire horizon, lighting up the\nclouds like a bonfire, and was reflected in the mirror-like waters,\nforming what seemed to be an immense circle of fire, of which the tree\noccupied the centre. Glenarvan and his companions watched this terrific spectacle in\nsilence. Sheets of dazzling light glided towards them, and blinding\nflashes followed in rapid succession, now showing the calm countenance\nof the major, then the speculative face of Paganel or the energetic\nfeatures of Glenarvan, and again the frightened look of Robert or the\nunconcerned expression of the sailors. The rain, however, did not fall\nas yet, nor had the wind risen. But soon the flood-gates of the heavens\nopened, and the rain came down in torrents, the drops, as they struck\nthe surface of the water, rebounding in thousands of sparks illuminated\nby the incessant lightning. Did this rain predict the end of the storm? Were Glenarvan and his\ncompanions to be released with a few thorough drenchings? At the height\nof this struggle of the elements, suddenly there appeared at the end\nof the branch which extended horizontally, a flaming globe, of the\nsize of a fist, and surrounded by a black smoke. This ball, after\nrevolving a few moments, burst like a bombshell, and with a noise that\nwas distinguishable in the midst of the general tumult. A sulphurous\nvapor filled the atmosphere. There was a moment of silence, and then\nTom Austin was heard crying,--\n\n\"The tree is on fire!\" He was right. In a moment the flame, as if it had been communicated\nto an immense piece of fireworks, spread along the west side of the\ntree. The dead limbs, the nests of dry grass, and finally the live wood\nitself, furnished material for the devouring element.

The curiosity of this unknown being was a singular contrast to the\ncalmness of the major.

When this enigmatical character saw his approaches mocked by the\nindifference of the major, he seized his telescope, which at its full\nlength measured four feet; and motionless, with legs straddled, like a\nsign-post on a highway, he pointed his instrument to the line where sky\nand water met.

Two days after this conversation, Captain Mangles took an observation,\nand the passengers saw, to their great satisfaction, upon consulting\nthe map, that they were in the vicinity of Cape Bernouilli, which\nthey might expect to reach in four days. The west wind had hitherto\nfavored the progress of the yacht, but for several days it had shown a\ntendency to fail, and now there was a perfect calm. The sails flapped\nidly against the masts, and had it not been for her powerful screw, the\nDuncan would have been becalmed on the ocean. [Sidenote: FOREBODINGS OF DISASTER.] This state of things might be prolonged indefinitely. At evening\nGlenarvan consulted the captain on the subject. The latter, whose\nsupply of coal was rapidly diminishing, appeared much disturbed at the\nsubsidence of the wind. He had covered his ship with canvas, and set\nhis studding- and main-sails, that he might take advantage of the least\nbreeze; but, in nautical language, there was not enough wind \"to fill a\nhat.\" \"At all events,\" said Glenarvan, \"we need not complain.

What do you apprehend?\" \"There are signs of a great storm. Do not trust the appearance of the\nsky, my lord; nothing is more deceptive. For two days the barometer\nhas fallen to an alarming degree.

The Frenchman, mistaking the vessel, had embarked while the crew of\nthe Duncan were engaged in the ceremony at Saint Mungo. Everything was\nexplained. But what would the geographer say, when he learned the name\nand destination of the vessel on which he had taken passage? \"So, Monsieur Paganel,\" said Glenarvan, \"you have chosen Calcutta as\nyour centre of action?\" \"Yes, my lord.

Faria, the beneficent and cheerful companion,\nwith whom he was accustomed to live so intimately, no longer breathed.

I cannot tell you how long we\nremained in this state; at that period I did not even know what time\nmeant. Sometimes, but very rarely, my father summoned me and my mother\nto the terrace of the palace; these were hours of recreation for me, as\nI never saw anything in the dismal cavern but the gloomy countenances\nof the slaves and Selim’s fiery lance. My father was endeavoring to\npierce with his eager looks the remotest verge of the horizon,\nexamining attentively every black speck which appeared on the lake,\nwhile my mother, reclining by his side, rested her head on his\nshoulder, and I played at his feet, admiring everything I saw with that\nunsophisticated innocence of childhood which throws a charm round\nobjects insignificant in themselves, but which in its eyes are invested\nwith the greatest importance. The heights of Pindus towered above us;\nthe castle of Yanina rose white and angular from the blue waters of the\nlake, and the immense masses of black vegetation which, viewed in the\ndistance, gave the idea of lichens clinging to the rocks, were in\nreality gigantic fir-trees and myrtles. “One morning my father sent for us; my mother had been crying all the\nnight, and was very wretched; we found the pasha calm, but paler than\nusual. ‘Take courage, Vasiliki,’ said he; ‘today arrives the firman of\nthe master, and my fate will be decided. If my pardon be complete, we\nshall return triumphant to Yanina; if the news be inauspicious, we must\nfly this night.’—‘But supposing our enemy should not allow us to do\nso?’ said my mother. ‘Oh, make yourself easy on that head,’ said Ali,\nsmiling; ‘Selim and his flaming lance will settle that matter. They\nwould be glad to see me dead, but they would not like themselves to die\nwith me.’\n\n“My mother only answered by sighs to consolations which she knew did\nnot come from my father’s heart. She prepared the iced water which he\nwas in the habit of constantly drinking,—for since his sojourn at the\nkiosk he had been parched by the most violent fever,—after which she\nanointed his white beard with perfumed oil, and lighted his chibouque,\nwhich he sometimes smoked for hours together, quietly watching the\nwreaths of vapor that ascended in spiral clouds and gradually melted\naway in the surrounding atmosphere. Presently he made such a sudden\nmovement that I was paralyzed with fear. Then, without taking his eyes\nfrom the object which had first attracted his attention, he asked for\nhis telescope. My mother gave it him, and as she did so, looked whiter\nthan the marble against which she leaned. I saw my father’s hand\ntremble. ‘A boat!—two!—three!’ murmured my, father;—‘four!’ He then\narose, seizing his arms and priming his pistols. ‘Vasiliki,’ said he to\nmy mother, trembling perceptibly, ‘the instant approaches which will\ndecide everything.

The piercing eye of Peppino had\nnoticed all. The chief took the paper, unfolded it, and, raising his\nhand, “Heaven be praised, and his Holiness also,” said he in a loud\nvoice; “here is a pardon for one of the prisoners!”\n\n“A pardon!” cried the people with one voice; “a pardon!”\n\nAt this cry Andrea raised his head. “Pardon for whom?” cried he. Peppino remained breathless. “A pardon for Peppino, called Rocca Priori,” said the principal friar. And he passed the paper to the officer commanding the carbineers, who\nread and returned it to him. “For Peppino!” cried Andrea, who seemed roused from the torpor in which\nhe had been plunged. “Why for him and not for me?

One night Edmond awoke suddenly, believing that he heard someone\ncalling him. He opened his eyes upon utter darkness. His name, or\nrather a plaintive voice which essayed to pronounce his name, reached\nhim. He sat up in bed and a cold sweat broke out upon his brow. Undoubtedly the call came from Faria’s dungeon. “Alas,” murmured Edmond; “can it be?”\n\nHe moved his bed, drew up the stone, rushed into the passage, and\nreached the opposite extremity; the secret entrance was open.

We shall see very little of him\non the voyage.\" Lady Helena and Mary Grant were very much pleased to know that they\nwere to start the next day. Glenarvan observed, however, that the\nMacquarie could not equal the Duncan for comfort; but, after so many\nhardships, they were not likely to be overcome by trifles. Mr. Olbinett\nwas requested to take charge of the provisions. The poor man, since the\nloss of the Duncan, had often lamented the unhappy fate of his wife,\nwho had remained on board, and would be, consequently, the victim of\nthe convicts' brutality. However, he fulfilled his duties as steward\nwith his accustomed zeal, and their food might yet consist of dishes\nthat were never seen on the ship's table. In the mean time the major discounted at a money-changer's some drafts\nthat Glenarvan had on the Union Bank of Melbourne. As for Paganel, he\nprocured an excellent map of New Zealand. Mulready was now quite well. He scarcely felt his wound, which had so\nnearly proved fatal. A few hours at sea would complete his recovery. [Illustration: The landlord of Victoria Hotel furnished them with two\nhorses, and they set out.] Wilson went on board first, charged with arranging the passengers'\nquarters. Under his vigorous use of the brush and broom the aspect\nof things was greatly changed. Will Halley shrugged his shoulders,\nbut allowed the sailor to do as he pleased. As for Glenarvan and his\nfriends, he scarcely noticed them; he did not even know their names,\nnor did he care to. This increase of cargo was worth fifty pounds to\nhim, but he valued it less than the two hundred tons of tanned leather\nwith which his hold was crowded,--the skins first, and the passengers\nnext. He was a real trader; and by his nautical ability he passed for a\ngood navigator of these seas, rendered so very dangerous by the coral\nreefs. During the afternoon, Glenarvan wished to visit once more the supposed\nplace of the shipwreck. Ayrton had certainly been the quartermaster of\nthe Britannia, and the vessel might really have been lost on that part\nof the coast. And there, at all events, the Duncan had fallen into the\nhands of the convicts. Had there been a fight? Perhaps they would find\non the beach traces of a struggle. If the crew had perished in the\nwaves, would not the bodies have been cast ashore? Glenarvan, accompanied by his faithful captain, undertook this\nexamination. The landlord of Victoria Hotel furnished them with two\nhorses, and they set out. But it was a sad journey. They rode in\nsilence. The same thoughts, the same anxieties, tortured the mind of\neach. They gazed at the rocks worn by the sea. They had no need to\nquestion or answer; no sign of the Duncan could be found,--the whole\ncoast was bare. Captain Mangles, however, found on the margin of the shore evident\nsigns of an encampment, the remains of fires recently kindled beneath\nthe few trees. Had a wandering tribe of natives passed there within\na few days? No, for an object struck Glenarvan's eye, which proved\nincontestably that the convicts had visited that part of the coast. [Sidenote: THE LAST NIGHT IN AUSTRALIA.] It was a gray and yellow jacket, worn and patched, left at the foot\nof a tree.", "similarity": 0.41712984442710876}, {"chunk_id": 168, "text": "On what road? What path take?\" At this very moment, as if in answer to the major, a cry of distress\nwas heard. \"Listen!\" said Glenarvan. The cry came from the very direction whence the report had sounded, but\nless than a quarter of a mile distant. Glenarvan, pushing back MacNabb,\nwas advancing along the path, when, not far from the cart, these words\nwere uttered:\n\n\"Help! help!\" It was a plaintive and despairing voice. Captain Mangles and the major\nrushed towards it. In a few moments they perceived, on the edge of\nthe coppice, a human form that was dragging itself along and groaning\npiteously. It was Mulready, wounded and half dead. When his companions\nraised him, they felt their hands dabbling in blood. The rain now\nincreased, and the wind howled through the branches of the dead trees. In the midst of these terrific gusts, Glenarvan, the major, and the\ncaptain bore the body of Mulready. On arriving at the cart, Paganel, Robert, Wilson, and Olbinett came\nout, and Lady Helena gave up her room to the poor sailor. The major\ntook off Mulready's vest, wet with blood and rain. He discovered the\nwound. It was a poniard stab, which the unfortunate had received in his\nright side. MacNabb dressed it skillfully. Whether the weapon had reached the vital\nparts, he could not say. A stream of bright-red blood spurted forth,\nwhile the paleness and the swoon of the wounded man proved that he had\nbeen seriously injured. The major accordingly placed upon the opening\nof the wound, after first washing it with fresh water, a thick wad of\ntinder, and then a few layers of lint, confined by a bandage, and thus\nsucceeded in stopping the hemorrhage. The patient was then laid on his\nside, his head and breast raised, and Lady Helena gave him a refreshing\ndraught. At the end of a quarter of an hour, the wounded man, who had been\nmotionless till then, made a movement. His eyes half opened, his lips\nmurmured disconnected words, and the major, putting down his ear, heard\nhim say:\n\n\"My lord--the letter--Ben Joyce----\"\n\n[Sidenote: A DAY OF DOUBT.] The major repeated these words, and glanced at his companions. What did\nMulready mean? Ben Joyce had attacked the sailor, but why? Was it not\nsimply for the purpose of preventing him from reaching the Duncan? This\nletter--Glenarvan examined the sailor's pockets. The letter addressed\nto Tom Austin was gone. The night passed in anxiety and anguish. They feared every moment that\nthe wounded man would die. A burning fever consumed him. Lady Helena\nand Mary Grant, as though his sisters, did not leave him; never was\npatient better nursed, or by more tender hands. Day appeared. The rain had ceased. Heavy clouds still rolled along\nthe vault of the sky, and the earth was strewn with the fragments of\nbranches. The clay, soaked by floods of water, had yielded; and the\nsides of the cart became unsteady, but sank no deeper. Captain Mangles, Paganel, and Glenarvan took a tour of exploration\naround the camp. They traversed the path still marked with blood, but\nfound no trace of Ben Joyce or his band. They went to the place where\nthe attack had been made. Here two corpses lay on the ground, shot\nby Mulready. One was the farrier of Black Point. His face, which had\nmortified, was a horrible sight. Glenarvan did not pursue his investigations farther, prudence\nforbidding. He therefore returned to the cart, much alarmed by the\nseriousness of the situation. \"We cannot think of sending another messenger to Melbourne,\" said he.", "similarity": 0.3962074816226959}]}

Why, it is also impossible for me to\nsay.

Chance threw us in his way. He heard Glenarvan's story of the\nshipwreck, and, like a bold man, he promptly decided to take part in\nthe expedition.

His intentions had been clearly proved,\nand required, on the part of Glenarvan, extreme vigilance. Fortunately,\nthere was less to fear from the detected bandit than the secret traitor. But one serious fact appeared from this explanation. No one had yet\nthought of it; only Mary Grant, disregarding the past, looked forward\nto the future. Captain Mangles first saw her pale and disconsolate. He\nunderstood what was passing in her mind. \"Miss Mary!\" cried he, \"you are weeping!\" \"What is the matter, my child?\" asked Lady Helena. \"My father, madam, my father!\" replied the young girl.

I saw that he was a dangerous person, and was\ncompelled, therefore, to take precautions against him.\" \"And since that time?\" \"Since that time he has been in his cabin, without offering to come\nout.\" \"Good!\" At this moment Glenarvan and Captain Mangles were summoned to the\nsaloon. Breakfast, which they so much needed, was ready. They took\nseats at the table, but did not speak of Ayrton. However, when the meal was ended, and the passengers had assembled on\ndeck, Glenarvan informed them of the quartermaster's presence on board. At the same time he declared his intention of sending for him. \"Can I be released from attending this tribunal?\" asked Lady Helena. \"I confess to you, my dear Edward, that the sight of this unfortunate\nwould be very painful to me.\" \"It is only to confront him, Helena,\" replied Glenarvan. \"Remain,\nif you can.

The crew of the yacht, who did\nnot yet understand the seriousness of these proceedings, maintained a\nprofound silence. \"Call Ayrton!\" said Glenarvan. CHAPTER LVI. AYRTON'S OBSTINACY. Ayrton soon made his appearance. He crossed the deck with a confident\nstep, and ascended the poop-stairs. His eyes had a sullen look, his\nteeth were set, and his fists clinched convulsively. His bearing\ndisplayed neither exultation nor humility. As soon as he was in Lord\nGlenarvan's presence, he folded his arms, and calmly and silently\nwaited to be questioned:\n\n\"Ayrton,\" said Glenarvan, \"here we all are, as you see, on board the\nDuncan, that you would have surrendered to Ben Joyce's accomplices.\" At these words the lips of the quartermaster slightly trembled.", "similarity": 0.5958091020584106}, {"chunk_id": 118, "text": "MacNabb,\ntherefore, reserved his opinion.

Ayrton knew Mary and Robert perfectly. He had seen them at Glasgow\non the departure of the Britannia. He remembered that they had been\npresent at the farewell dinner given on board to the friends of the\ncaptain. Sheriff MacIntyre was one of the guests. Robert--scarcely\nten years old--had been confided to the care of Dick Turner, the\nboatswain, but had escaped from him and climbed to the top-sail\nyard-arm. [Illustration: At last, exhausted and almost dead, he reached the\nhospitable dwelling of Mr. O'Moore, where his labor insured him a\ncomfortable livelihood.] \"It is true! it is true!\" cried Robert. The quartermaster remembered, too, a thousand little circumstances\nto which he did not seem to attach so much importance as did Captain\nMangles. When he stopped, Mary said, in her sweet voice,--\n\n\"Mr. Ayrton, please tell us more about our father.\" Ayrton acceded to the young girl's request. Glenarvan was reluctant to\ninterrupt him, and yet many more important questions thronged his mind. But Lady Helena, pointing out to him Mary's joyful excitement, checked\nhis inquiries. [Sidenote: TWO YEARS OF SLAVERY.] The quartermaster now told the story of the Britannia and her voyage\nacross the Pacific. During the period of a year Harry Grant landed\nat the principal ports of Oceanica, opposing unjustifiable captures,\nand often a victim to the hostility of unjust traders. He found,\nhowever, an important point on the western coast of Papua. Here the\nestablishment of a Scottish colony appeared to him feasible, and its\nprosperity assured. After examining Papua, the Britannia sailed to\nCallao for provisions, and left that port on the 30th of May, 1862, to\nreturn to Europe by the way of the Indian Ocean and the Cape. Three\nweeks after her departure, a terrible tempest disabled her. It became\nnecessary to cut away the masts. A leak was discovered in the hold,\nwhich they did not succeed in stopping. The crew were soon overtasked\nand exhausted. The pumps could not be worked. For eight days the\nvessel was at the mercy of the storm. There were six feet of water\nin her hold, and she gradually foundered. The boats had been washed\noverboard, and the crew had given themselves up for lost, when on the\nnight of June 22nd, as Paganel had rightly interpreted, they descried\nthe eastern coast of Australia. The vessel soon stranded. A violent\nshock was felt. At this moment Ayrton, borne by a wave, was cast into\nthe midst of the breakers, and lost all consciousness. When he came to\nhimself, he was in the hands of the natives, who carried him into the\ninterior of the country. Since then he had heard nothing more of the\nBritannia, and naturally supposed that she had been wrecked, with all\non board, on the dangerous reefs of Twofold Bay. This was Ayrton's story, which elicited more than once exclamations of\nsympathy. The major could not justly doubt its correctness; and after\nthis recital the quartermaster's own experiences possessed a more real\ninterest. Indeed, thanks to the document, they no longer doubted that\nCaptain Grant had survived the shipwreck with two of his sailors. From\nthe fate of the one they could fairly conjecture that of the other.", "similarity": 0.547626793384552}, {"chunk_id": 236, "text": "His character did not harmonize with mine.

However it may be, Captain Grant did not hesitate to land\nme, April 8, 1862, on the west coast of Australia.\" \"Australia!\" exclaimed the major, interrupting Ayrton's story. \"Then\nyou left the Britannia before her arrival at Callao, where the last\nnews of her was dated?\" \"Yes,\" replied the quartermaster; \"for the Britannia never stopped at\nCallao while I was on board. If I spoke of Callao at O'Moore's farm, it\nwas your story that gave me this information.\" \"Go on, Ayrton,\" said Glenarvan. [Sidenote: MORE BLANKS THAN PRIZES.] \"I found myself, therefore, abandoned on an almost desert coast, but\nonly twenty miles from the penitentiary of Perth, the capital of\nWestern Australia. Wandering along the shore, I met a band of convicts\nwho had just escaped. I joined them. You will spare me, my lord, the\naccount of my life for two years and a half. It is enough to know that\nI became chief of the runaways, under the name of Ben Joyce. In the\nmonth of September, 1864, I made my appearance at the Irishman's farm,\nand was received as a servant under my true name of Ayrton. Here I\nwaited till an opportunity should be offered to gain possession of a\nvessel. This was my great object. Two months later the Duncan arrived. During your visit at the farm you related, my lord, the whole story of\nCaptain Grant. I then learned what I had not known, the Britannia's\nstoppage at Callao, the last news of her, dated June, 1862, two months\nafter my abandonment, the finding of the document, the shipwreck of the\nvessel, and finally the important reasons you had for seeking Captain\nGrant in Australia. I did not hesitate, but resolved to appropriate\nthe Duncan,--a marvelous ship, that would have distanced the best of\nthe British navy. However, there were serious injuries to be repaired. I therefore let her start for Melbourne, and offered myself to you in\nmy real character of quartermaster, volunteering to guide you to the\nscene of the shipwreck, which I falsely located on the eastern coast\nof Australia. Thus followed at a distance and sometimes preceded by\nmy band of convicts, I conducted your party across the province of\nVictoria. My companions committed a useless crime at Camden Bridge,\nsince the Duncan, once at Twofold Bay, could not have escaped me, and\nwith it I should have been master of the ocean. I brought you thus\nunsuspectingly as far as the Snowy River. The horses and oxen fell dead\none by one, poisoned by the gastrolobium. I entangled the cart in the\nmarshes. At my suggestion----but you know the rest, my lord, and can\nbe certain that, except for Mr. Paganel's absent-mindedness, I should\nnow be commander on board the Duncan. Such is my story, gentlemen. My\ndisclosures, unfortunately, cannot set you on the track of Captain\nGrant, and you see that in dealing with me you have made a bad bargain.\" The quartermaster ceased, crossed his arms, according to his custom,\nand waited. Glenarvan and his friends were silent. They felt that this\nstrange criminal had told the entire truth. The capture of the Duncan\nhad only failed through a cause altogether beyond his control. His\naccomplices had reached Twofold Bay, as the convict's blouse, found by\nGlenarvan, proved.", "similarity": 0.5756418108940125}]}

He was a tall, stout fellow, but of a low and\nbrutish appearance, which did not prepossess one in his favor. However,\nthis was of little importance, if he knew his business. At all events\nhis breath was not wasted in idle words. \"Is he an efficient workman?\" inquired Captain Mangles of the\nquartermaster. \"I know no more than you, captain,\" replied Ayrton. \"We shall see.\" The farrier began his work. He was a man who understood his trade, as\none could see by the way in which he repaired the wheels of the cart. He labored skillfully and with uncommon energy. During the operation, the major noticed that the farrier's wrists were\nconsiderably eroded, and that they were each encircled by a blackish\nring of extravasated blood. These were the marks of recent wounds,\nwhich the sleeves of a miserable woolen shirt but partially concealed. MacNabb questioned the man about these erosions, which must have been\nvery painful. He, however, made no reply, but stolidly kept on at his\nwork. Two hours after, the injuries of the cart were repaired. As for\nGlenarvan's horse, he was quickly shod. The farrier had taken care to\nbring shoes all prepared. There was a peculiarity about them, however,\nwhich did not escape the major. It was a trefoil rudely carved on the\nouter rim. He pointed it out to Ayrton. \"It is the Black Point mark,\" replied the quartermaster, \"which enables\nthem to follow the tracks of the horses that stray from the station,\nand not confound them with others.\" The farrier, having done all that was required of him, now claimed his\nwages, and departed without having spoken four words. Half an hour later, the travelers were on the move. Beyond the curtain\nof mimosas extended a broad, uncovered space, which justly deserved its\nname of \"open plain.\" Fragments of quartz and ferruginous rocks lay\namong the bushes, tall grass, and hedgerows that protected numerous\nflocks.", "similarity": 0.4365028738975525}, {"chunk_id": 118, "text": "MacNabb,\ntherefore, reserved his opinion.

Ayrton knew Mary and Robert perfectly. He had seen them at Glasgow\non the departure of the Britannia. He remembered that they had been\npresent at the farewell dinner given on board to the friends of the\ncaptain. Sheriff MacIntyre was one of the guests. Robert--scarcely\nten years old--had been confided to the care of Dick Turner, the\nboatswain, but had escaped from him and climbed to the top-sail\nyard-arm. [Illustration: At last, exhausted and almost dead, he reached the\nhospitable dwelling of Mr. O'Moore, where his labor insured him a\ncomfortable livelihood.] \"It is true! it is true!\" cried Robert. The quartermaster remembered, too, a thousand little circumstances\nto which he did not seem to attach so much importance as did Captain\nMangles. When he stopped, Mary said, in her sweet voice,--\n\n\"Mr. Ayrton, please tell us more about our father.\" Ayrton acceded to the young girl's request. Glenarvan was reluctant to\ninterrupt him, and yet many more important questions thronged his mind. But Lady Helena, pointing out to him Mary's joyful excitement, checked\nhis inquiries. [Sidenote: TWO YEARS OF SLAVERY.] The quartermaster now told the story of the Britannia and her voyage\nacross the Pacific. During the period of a year Harry Grant landed\nat the principal ports of Oceanica, opposing unjustifiable captures,\nand often a victim to the hostility of unjust traders. He found,\nhowever, an important point on the western coast of Papua. Here the\nestablishment of a Scottish colony appeared to him feasible, and its\nprosperity assured. After examining Papua, the Britannia sailed to\nCallao for provisions, and left that port on the 30th of May, 1862, to\nreturn to Europe by the way of the Indian Ocean and the Cape. Three\nweeks after her departure, a terrible tempest disabled her. It became\nnecessary to cut away the masts. A leak was discovered in the hold,\nwhich they did not succeed in stopping. The crew were soon overtasked\nand exhausted. The pumps could not be worked. For eight days the\nvessel was at the mercy of the storm. There were six feet of water\nin her hold, and she gradually foundered. The boats had been washed\noverboard, and the crew had given themselves up for lost, when on the\nnight of June 22nd, as Paganel had rightly interpreted, they descried\nthe eastern coast of Australia. The vessel soon stranded. A violent\nshock was felt. At this moment Ayrton, borne by a wave, was cast into\nthe midst of the breakers, and lost all consciousness. When he came to\nhimself, he was in the hands of the natives, who carried him into the\ninterior of the country. Since then he had heard nothing more of the\nBritannia, and naturally supposed that she had been wrecked, with all\non board, on the dangerous reefs of Twofold Bay. This was Ayrton's story, which elicited more than once exclamations of\nsympathy. The major could not justly doubt its correctness; and after\nthis recital the quartermaster's own experiences possessed a more real\ninterest. Indeed, thanks to the document, they no longer doubted that\nCaptain Grant had survived the shipwreck with two of his sailors. From\nthe fate of the one they could fairly conjecture that of the other.", "similarity": 0.43543747067451477}, {"chunk_id": 162, "text": "I knew what\nI wished, and returned to the encampment with the certainty that all\nthe convicts in Australia are not reformed, in spite of Paganel's\narguments.\" \"Then,\" said Glenarvan, whose face was pale with anger, \"Ayrton has\nbrought us here to rob and assassinate us?\" \"Yes,\" replied the major. \"And, since leaving the Wimerra, his band has followed and watched us,\nwaiting for a favorable opportunity?\" [Sidenote: FROM DEPTH TO DEPTH.] \"Yes.\" \"But this wretch is not, then, a sailor of the Britannia? He has stolen\nhis name and contract?\" All eyes were turned towards MacNabb, who must have considered this\nmatter. \"These,\" replied he, in his calm voice, \"are the proofs that can be\nderived from this obscure state of affairs. In my opinion this man's\nreal name is Ayrton. Ben Joyce is his fighting title. It is certain\nthat he knows Harry Grant, and has been quartermaster on board the\nBritannia. These facts, proved already by the precise details given\nby Ayrton, are still further corroborated by the conversation of the\nconvicts that I have related. Let us not, therefore, be led astray\nby vain conjectures, but only be certain that Ayrton is Ben Joyce, a\nsailor of the Britannia, now chief of a band of convicts.\" The major's explanation was accepted as conclusive. \"Now,\" replied Glenarvan, \"will you tell me how and why Harry Grant's\nquartermaster is in Australia?\" \"How, I do not know,\" said MacNabb; \"and the police declare they know\nno more than I on the subject. Why, it is also impossible for me to\nsay. Here is a mystery that the future will explain.\" \"The police do not even know the identity of Ayrton and Ben Joyce,\"\nsaid Captain Mangles. \"You are right, John,\" replied the major; \"and such information would\nbe likely to facilitate their search.\" \"This unfortunate, then,\" remarked Lady Helena, \"intruded into\nO'Moore's farm with a criminal intention?\" \"There is no doubt of it,\" continued MacNabb. \"He was meditating\nsome hostile attack upon the Irishman, when a better opportunity was\noffered. Chance threw us in his way. He heard Glenarvan's story of the\nshipwreck, and, like a bold man, he promptly decided to take part in\nthe expedition. At the Wimerra he communicated with one of his friends,\nthe farrier of Black Point, and thus left distinguishable traces of\nour course. His band followed us. A poisonous plant enabled him to\ngradually kill our oxen and horses. Then, at the proper moment, he\nentangled us in the marshes of the Snowy, and surrendered us to the\nconvicts he commanded.\" Everything possible had been said concerning Ben Joyce. His past had\njust been reviewed by the major, and the wretch appeared as he was,--a\nbold and formidable criminal. His intentions had been clearly proved,\nand required, on the part of Glenarvan, extreme vigilance. Fortunately,\nthere was less to fear from the detected bandit than the secret traitor. But one serious fact appeared from this explanation. No one had yet\nthought of it; only Mary Grant, disregarding the past, looked forward\nto the future. Captain Mangles first saw her pale and disconsolate. He\nunderstood what was passing in her mind. \"Miss Mary!\" cried he, \"you are weeping!\" \"What is the matter, my child?\" asked Lady Helena. \"My father, madam, my father!\" replied the young girl. She could not continue. But a sudden revelation dawned on the mind of\neach. They comprehended Mary's grief, why the tears flowed from her\neyes, why the name of her father rose to her lips.

Captain Mangles and Wilson at once occupied themselves in constructing\na raft of large dimensions. Experience had proved that pieces of bark\ncould not resist the violence of the torrent. The captain cut down\nseveral gum-trees, of which he made a rude but substantial raft. It was\na tedious task, and that day ended before the work was completed; but\nthe next day it was finished. The waters had now considerably subsided. The torrent had become a\nriver again, with a rapid current. However, with proper management, the\ncaptain hoped to reach the opposite bank. At noon they put on board as much provisions as each could carry for\ntwo days' travel. The rest was abandoned with the cart and the tent.

As soon as he arrived at the bay, he was to\nsend a detachment of sailors under the command of Ayrton. He had just reached this part of his letter, when the major, who had\nbeen looking over his shoulder, asked him, in a singular tone, how he\nwrote the word Ayrton. \"As it is pronounced,\" replied Glenarvan. \"That is a mistake,\" said the major coolly. \"It is pronounced Ayrton,\nbut it is written 'Ben Joyce'!\" CHAPTER XLI. THE PLOT UNVEILED. The sound of the name of Ben Joyce fell upon the party like a\nthunderbolt. Ayrton suddenly sprang to his feet. In his hand was a\nrevolver. A report was heard; and Glenarvan fell, struck by a bullet. Before Captain Mangles and the sailors recovered from the surprise into\nwhich this unexpected turn of affairs had thrown them, the audacious\nconvict had escaped, and joined his band, scattered along the edge of\nthe wood of gum-trees. [Illustration: A report was heard; and Glenarvan fell, struck by a\nbullet.] The tent did not offer a sufficient shelter against the bullets, and\nit was clearly necessary to beat a retreat. Glenarvan, who was but\nslightly injured, had risen. \"To the cart! to the cart!\" cried Captain Mangles, as he hurried on\nLady Helena and Mary Grant, who were soon in safety behind its stout\nsides. The captain, the major, Paganel, and the sailors then seized their\nrifles, and stood ready to repel the convicts. Glenarvan and Robert had\njoined the ladies, while Olbinett hastened to the common defence. These events had transpired with the rapidity of lightning. Captain\nMangles attentively watched the edge of the wood; but the reports\nsuddenly ceased on the arrival of Ben Joyce, and a profound silence\nsucceeded the noisy fusillade. A few wreaths of white smoke were still\ncurling up between the branches of the gum-trees, but the tall tufts of\ngastrolobium were motionless and all signs of attack had disappeared. The major and Captain Mangles extended their examinations as far as the\ngreat trees. The place was abandoned. Numerous footprints were seen,\nand a few half-burnt cartridges smoked on the ground. The major, like\na prudent man, extinguished them, for a spark was enough to kindle a\nformidable conflagration in this forest of dry trees. \"The convicts have disappeared,\" said Captain Mangles. \"Yes,\" replied the major; \"and this disappearance alarms me. I should\nprefer to meet them face to face. It is better to encounter a tiger in\nthe open plain than a serpent in the grass. Let us search these bushes\naround the cart.\" [Sidenote: UNRAVELINGS.] The major and captain scoured the surrounding country. But from the\nedge of the wood to the banks of the Snowy they did not meet with a\nsingle convict. Ben Joyce's band seemed to have flown away, like a\nflock of mischievous birds. This disappearance was too strange to\ninspire a perfect security. They therefore resolved to keep on the\nwatch. The cart, which was a really immovable fortress, became the\ncentre of the encampment, and two men kept guard, relieving each other\nevery hour. Lady Helena and Mary Grant's first care had been to dress Glenarvan's\nwound.", "similarity": 0.4113861918449402}, {"chunk_id": 84, "text": "The present situation of these refugees was undeniably insecure. The\ntree would not probably give way to the force of the current, but the\nrising waters might reach the top branches, for the depression of\nthe soil made this part of the plain a deep reservoir. Glenarvan's\nfirst care, therefore, was to establish, by means of notches, points\nof comparison which enabled him to note the different heights of the\nwater. The flood was now stationary, and it appeared to have reached\nits greatest elevation. This was encouraging. \"And now what shall we do?\" asked Glenarvan. \"Build our nest, of course,\" replied Paganel. \"Build our nest!\" cried Robert. \"Certainly, my boy, and live the life of birds, since we cannot live\nthe life of fishes.\" \"Very well,\" said Glenarvan; \"but who will give us our beakful?\" \"I,\" replied the major. All eyes were turned towards MacNabb, who was comfortably seated in a\nnatural arm-chair formed of two pliant branches, and with one hand was\nholding out the wet though well-filled saddle-bags. \"Ah, MacNabb,\" cried Glenarvan, \"this is just like you! You think of\neverything, even under circumstances where it is allowable to forget.\" \"As soon as it was decided not to be drowned, I concluded not to die of\nhunger.\" \"I should not have thought of this,\" said Paganel, innocently; \"but I\nam so absent-minded!\" \"And what do the saddle-bags contain?\" inquired Tom Austin. \"Provisions for seven men for two days,\" replied MacNabb. \"Well,\" said Glenarvan, \"I hope that the inundation will be\nconsiderably lower twenty-four hours hence.\" \"Or that we shall find some means of gaining _terra firma_,\" added\nPaganel. \"Our first business, then, is to breakfast,\" said Glenarvan. \"After drying ourselves,\" observed the major. \"And fire?\" said Wilson. \"Why, we must make one,\" replied Paganel. \"Where?\" \"At the top of the trunk, of course.\" \"With what?\" \"With dead wood that we shall cut in the tree.\" \"But how kindle it?\" said Glenarvan. \"Our tinder is like a wet sponge.\" \"We will manage that,\" answered Paganel; \"a little dry moss, a ray of\nsunlight, the lens of my telescope, and you will see by what a fire I\nwill dry myself. Who will go for wood in the forest?\" \"I!\" cried Robert, and, followed by his friend Wilson, he disappeared\nlike a cat in the depths of the foliage. [Sidenote: GOING BIRD'S-NESTING.] During their absence Paganel found dry moss in sufficient quantity; he\navailed himself of a ray of sunlight, which was easy, for the orb of\nday now shone with a vivid brightness, and then, with the aid of his\nlens, he kindled without difficulty the combustible materials which\nwere laid on a bed of leaves in the fork of the branches. It was a\nnatural fireplace, with no danger of conflagration. Wilson and Robert soon returned with an armful of dead wood, which was\ncast on the fire. Paganel, to cause a draught, placed himself above the\nfireplace, his long legs crossed in the Arab fashion; then, moving his\nbody rapidly up and down, he produced, by means of his poncho, a strong\ncurrent of air. The wood kindled, and a bright, roaring flame soon rose\nfrom this improvised oven. Each dried himself in his own way, while the\nponchos, hung on the branches, swung to and fro in the breeze. They now breakfasted, sparingly however, for they had to allow for the\nfollowing day.

They felt that he was seeking\nin their looks some ray of hope, and they lowered their eyes. \"Well,\" continued Glenarvan, \"you understand me; you are silent! You\nhave no more hope!\" A few moments of silence ensued, when MacNabb inquired:\n\n\"Who of you, my friends, remembers when Robert disappeared?\" To this question no answer was given. \"At least,\" continued the major, \"you can tell with whom the boy was\nduring the descent.\" \"With me,\" replied Wilson. \"Well, at what moment did you last see him with you?

I remember that his poncho flapped in my face.\" \"And where were you situated in reference to us?\" \"On the left also.\" \"Then Robert could have disappeared only on this side,\" said the major,\nturning towards the mountain, and pointing to the right. \"And also\nconsidering the time that has elapsed since his disappearance, the\nchild must have fallen at a high part of the mountain. There we must\nsearch, and, by taking different ways, we shall find him.\" Not a word more was said.

[Sidenote: A SLEEPLESS NIGHT.] All this portion of the Andes, except a few inaccessible plateaus,\nwas carefully explored for many hours without one of these brave men\nthinking of rest. But it was a vain search. The child had not only\nfound death in the mountains, but also a tomb, the stone of which,\nmade of some enormous rock, was forever closed over him. Towards noon Glenarvan and his companions, bruised and exhausted, found\nthemselves again in the valley. The former was a prey to the most\nviolent grief. He scarcely spoke, and from his lips issued only these\nwords, broken by sighs,--\"I will not go; I will not go!\" Each understood this determination, and respected it. \"We will wait,\" said Paganel to the major and Tom Austin. \"Let us take\nsome rest, and recruit our strength. We shall need it, whether to begin\nour search or continue our journey.\" \"Yes,\" replied MacNabb, \"let us remain, since Edward wishes it.

Of what use can\nhe be?\" \"To give us the information we need for our journey,\" replied\nGlenarvan. \"Let us go in.\" Glenarvan, followed by Ayrton, entered the tavern. The landlord of\n\"Bush Inn\" was a coarse man, of forbidding appearance, who had to\nconsider himself as the principal customer for the gin, brandy, and\nwhisky of his tavern, and scarcely ever saw any one but squatters or\nherdsmen. He replied in an ill-humored way to the questions that were addressed\nhim; but his answers sufficed to determine Ayrton upon his course. Glenarvan, however, remunerated the tavern-keeper for the little\ntrouble they had given him, and was about to leave the inn, when a\nplacard, affixed to the wall, attracted his attention. It was a notice\nof the colonial police, detailing the escape of the convicts from\nPerth, and setting a price upon the head of Ben Joyce--a hundred pounds\nsterling to any one who should deliver him up. \"Indeed,\" said Glenarvan, \"that is a rascal worth hanging.\" \"And especially worth taking,\" replied Ayrton. \"A hundred pounds! What\na sum! He is not worth it.\" \"As for the inn-keeper,\" added Glenarvan, as he left the room, \"I\nscarcely put faith in him, despite his placard.\" \"Nor I either,\" said Ayrton. Glenarvan and the quartermaster rejoined the party, and they all\nproceeded to where a narrow pass wound across the chain. Here they\nbegan the ascent. [Sidenote: ANOTHER DEATH.] But it was an arduous task. More than once the ladies and their\ncompanions had to dismount, and it was often necessary to push the\nwheels of the heavy vehicle at some steep ascent, or to hold it\nback along the edge of some dangerous precipice. The oxen, as they\ncould not work to advantage at sudden turns, had frequently to be\nunyoked, and the cart blocked to prevent it from sliding back. Ayrton\nwas repeatedly forced to bring the already exhausted horses to his\nassistance. Whether this exertion was too prolonged, or whether from some other\ncause, one of the horses gave out during the ascent. He fell suddenly,\nwithout an instant's warning. It was Mulready's horse; and when the\nsailor attempted to help him up, he found that he was dead. Ayrton\nexamined the animal carefully, but did not seem to understand the cause\nof this sudden death. \"The beast must have burst a blood-vessel,\" said Glenarvan. \"Evidently,\" replied Ayrton. \"Take my horse, Mulready,\" added Glenarvan; \"I will join Lady Helena in\nthe cart.\" Mulready obeyed, and the little party continued their fatiguing ascent,\nabandoning the body to the crows. The next day they began the descent, which was much more rapid. During\nits course a violent hail-storm burst on them, and they were forced to\nseek a shelter beneath the rocks. Not hailstones, but pieces of ice as\nlarge as one's hand, were precipitated from the angry clouds. A sling\ncould not have hurled them with greater force, and several sharp blows\nwarned Paganel and Robert to be on their guard.

Valentine, with a color still\nheightened by emotion, entered the room just after her parents had\nquitted it. One look was sufficient to tell her that her grandfather\nwas suffering, and that there was much on his mind which he was wishing\nto communicate to her. “Dear grandpapa,” cried she, “what has happened? They have vexed you,\nand you are angry?”\n\nThe paralytic closed his eyes in token of assent. “Who has displeased you? Is it my father?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Madame de Villefort?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Me?” The former sign was repeated. “Are you displeased with me?” cried Valentine in astonishment. M.\nNoirtier again closed his eyes. “And what have I done, dear grandpapa, that you should be angry with\nme?” cried Valentine. There was no answer, and she continued:\n\n“I have not seen you all day. Has anyone been speaking to you against\nme?”\n\n“Yes,” said the old man’s look, with eagerness. “Let me think a moment. I do assure you, grandpapa—Ah—M. and Madame de\nVillefort have just left this room, have they not?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“And it was they who told you something which made you angry? What was\nit then? May I go and ask them, that I may have the opportunity of\nmaking my peace with you?”\n\n“No, no,” said Noirtier’s look. “Ah, you frighten me. What can they have said?” and she again tried to\nthink what it could be. “Ah, I know,” said she, lowering her voice and going close to the old\nman. “They have been speaking of my marriage,—have they not?”\n\n“Yes,” replied the angry look. “I understand; you are displeased at the silence I have preserved on\nthe subject. The reason of it was, that they had insisted on my keeping\nthe matter a secret, and begged me not to tell you anything of it. They\ndid not even acquaint me with their intentions, and I only discovered\nthem by chance, that is why I have been so reserved with you, dear\ngrandpapa. Pray forgive me.”\n\nBut there was no look calculated to reassure her; all it seemed to say\nwas, “It is not only your reserve which afflicts me.”\n\n“What is it, then?” asked the young girl. “Perhaps you think I shall\nabandon you, dear grandpapa, and that I shall forget you when I am\nmarried?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“They told you, then, that M. d’Épinay consented to our all living\ntogether?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Then why are you still vexed and grieved?” The old man’s eyes beamed\nwith an expression of gentle affection. “Yes, I understand,” said Valentine; “it is because you love me.” The\nold man assented. “And you are afraid I shall be unhappy?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“You do not like M. Franz?” The eyes repeated several times, “No, no,\nno.”\n\n“Then you are vexed with the engagement?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Well, listen,” said Valentine, throwing herself on her knees, and\nputting her arm round her grandfather’s neck, “I am vexed, too, for I\ndo not love M.

These were the only obstacles which appeared\npossible to the young man. The idea that her strength had failed her in attempting to escape, and\nthat she had fainted in one of the paths, was the one that most\nimpressed itself upon his mind. “In that case,” said he, “I should lose\nher, and by my own fault.” He dwelt on this idea for a moment, then it\nappeared reality. He even thought he could perceive something on the\nground at a distance; he ventured to call, and it seemed to him that\nthe wind wafted back an almost inarticulate sigh. At last the half-hour struck. It was impossible to wait longer, his\ntemples throbbed violently, his eyes were growing dim; he passed one\nleg over the wall, and in a moment leaped down on the other side. He\nwas on Villefort’s premises—had arrived there by scaling the wall. What\nmight be the consequences? However, he had not ventured thus far to\ndraw back. He followed a short distance close under the wall, then\ncrossed a path, hid entered a clump of trees. In a moment he had passed\nthrough them, and could see the house distinctly. 30341m\n\n\n\nThen Morrel saw that he had been right in believing that the house was\nnot illuminated. Instead of lights at every window, as is customary on\ndays of ceremony, he saw only a gray mass, which was veiled also by a\ncloud, which at that moment obscured the moon’s feeble light. A light\nmoved rapidly from time to time past three windows of the second floor. These three windows were in Madame de Saint-Méran’s room. Another\nremained motionless behind some red curtains which were in Madame de\nVillefort’s bedroom. Morrel guessed all this. So many times, in order\nto follow Valentine in thought at every hour in the day, had he made\nher describe the whole house, that without having seen it he knew it\nall. This darkness and silence alarmed Morrel still more than Valentine’s\nabsence had done. Almost mad with grief, and determined to venture\neverything in order to see Valentine once more, and be certain of the\nmisfortune he feared, Morrel gained the edge of the clump of trees, and\nwas going to pass as quickly as possible through the flower-garden,\nwhen the sound of a voice, still at some distance, but which was borne\nupon the wind, reached him. At this sound, as he was already partially\nexposed to view, he stepped back and concealed himself completely,\nremaining perfectly motionless. He had formed his resolution. If it was Valentine alone, he would speak\nas she passed; if she was accompanied, and he could not speak, still he\nshould see her, and know that she was safe; if they were strangers, he\nwould listen to their conversation, and might understand something of\nthis hitherto incomprehensible mystery. The moon had just then escaped from behind the cloud which had\nconcealed it, and Morrel saw Villefort come out upon the steps,\nfollowed by a gentleman in black. They descended, and advanced towards\nthe clump of trees, and Morrel soon recognized the other gentleman as\nDoctor d’Avrigny. 30339m\n\n\n\nThe young man, seeing them approach, drew back mechanically, until he\nfound himself stopped by a sycamore-tree in the centre of the clump;\nthere he was compelled to remain. Soon the two gentlemen stopped also. “Ah, my dear doctor,” said the procureur, “Heaven declares itself\nagainst my house! What a dreadful death—what a blow!

Noirtier de Villefort\n\nWe will now relate what was passing in the house of the king’s attorney\nafter the departure of Madame Danglars and her daughter, and during the\ntime of the conversation between Maximilian and Valentine, which we\nhave just detailed. M. de Villefort entered his father’s room, followed by Madame de\nVillefort. Both of the visitors, after saluting the old man and\nspeaking to Barrois, a faithful servant, who had been twenty-five years\nin his service, took their places on either side of the paralytic. M. Noirtier was sitting in an armchair, which moved upon casters, in\nwhich he was wheeled into the room in the morning, and in the same way\ndrawn out again at night. He was placed before a large glass, which\nreflected the whole apartment, and so, without any attempt to move,\nwhich would have been impossible, he could see all who entered the room\nand everything which was going on around him. M. Noirtier, although\nalmost as immovable as a corpse, looked at the new-comers with a quick\nand intelligent expression, perceiving at once, by their ceremonious\ncourtesy, that they were come on business of an unexpected and official\ncharacter. Sight and hearing were the only senses remaining, and they, like two\nsolitary sparks, remained to animate the miserable body which seemed\nfit for nothing but the grave; it was only, however, by means of one of\nthese senses that he could reveal the thoughts and feelings that still\noccupied his mind, and the look by which he gave expression to his\ninner life was like the distant gleam of a candle which a traveller\nsees by night across some desert place, and knows that a living being\ndwells beyond the silence and obscurity. Noirtier’s hair was long and white, and flowed over his shoulders;\nwhile in his eyes, shaded by thick black lashes, was concentrated, as\nit often happens with an organ which is used to the exclusion of the\nothers, all the activity, address, force, and intelligence which were\nformerly diffused over his whole body; and so although the movement of\nthe arm, the sound of the voice, and the agility of the body, were\nwanting, the speaking eye sufficed for all. He commanded with it; it\nwas the medium through which his thanks were conveyed. In short, his\nwhole appearance produced on the mind the impression of a corpse with\nliving eyes, and nothing could be more startling than to observe the\nexpression of anger or joy suddenly lighting up these organs, while the\nrest of the rigid and marble-like features were utterly deprived of the\npower of participation.", "similarity": 0.6497299671173096}, {"chunk_id": 479, "text": "He commanded with it; it\nwas the medium through which his thanks were conveyed.

Bowed down with fatigue, she was indeed confined to her bed;\nand it was in her own room, and from the lips of Madame de Villefort,\nthat she heard all the strange events we have related; we mean the\nflight of Eugénie and the arrest of Andrea Cavalcanti, or rather\nBenedetto, together with the accusation of murder pronounced against\nhim. But Valentine was so weak that this recital scarcely produced the\nsame effect it would have done had she been in her usual state of\nhealth. Indeed, her brain was only the seat of vague ideas, and\nconfused forms, mingled with strange fancies, alone presented\nthemselves before her eyes. During the daytime Valentine’s perceptions remained tolerably clear,\nowing to the constant presence of M. Noirtier, who caused himself to be\ncarried to his granddaughter’s room, and watched her with his paternal\ntenderness; Villefort also, on his return from the law courts,\nfrequently passed an hour or two with his father and child. At six o’clock Villefort retired to his study, at eight M. d’Avrigny\nhimself arrived, bringing the night draught prepared for the young\ngirl, and then M. Noirtier was carried away. A nurse of the doctor’s\nchoice succeeded them, and never left till about ten or eleven o’clock,\nwhen Valentine was asleep. As she went downstairs she gave the keys of\nValentine’s room to M. de Villefort, so that no one could reach the\nsick-room excepting through that of Madame de Villefort and little\nEdward. Every morning Morrel called on Noirtier to receive news of Valentine,\nand, extraordinary as it seemed, each day found him less uneasy. Certainly, though Valentine still labored under dreadful nervous\nexcitement, she was better; and moreover, Monte Cristo had told him\nwhen, half distracted, he had rushed to the count’s house, that if she\nwere not dead in two hours she would be saved. Now four days had\nelapsed, and Valentine still lived. The nervous excitement of which we speak pursued Valentine even in her\nsleep, or rather in that state of somnolence which succeeded her waking\nhours; it was then, in the silence of night, in the dim light shed from\nthe alabaster lamp on the chimney-piece, that she saw the shadows pass\nand repass which hover over the bed of sickness, and fan the fever with\ntheir trembling wings. First she fancied she saw her stepmother\nthreatening her, then Morrel stretched his arms towards her; sometimes\nmere strangers, like the Count of Monte Cristo came to visit her; even\nthe very furniture, in these moments of delirium, seemed to move, and\nthis state lasted till about three o’clock in the morning, when a deep,\nheavy slumber overcame the young girl, from which she did not awake\ntill daylight. On the evening of the day on which Valentine had learned of the flight\nof Eugénie and the arrest of Benedetto,—Villefort having retired as\nwell as Noirtier and d’Avrigny,—her thoughts wandered in a confused\nmaze, alternately reviewing her own situation and the events she had\njust heard. Eleven o’clock had struck.

Valentine arose, placed a chair for Morrel, requested Barrois not to\nadmit anyone, and having tenderly embraced her grandfather, and\nsorrowfully taken leave of Morrel, she went away. To prove to Noirtier\nthat he was in Valentine’s confidence and knew all their secrets,\nMorrel took the dictionary, a pen, and some paper, and placed them all\non a table where there was a light. “But first,” said Morrel, “allow me, sir, to tell you who I am, how\nmuch I love Mademoiselle Valentine, and what are my designs respecting\nher.”\n\nNoirtier made a sign that he would listen. It was an imposing sight to witness this old man, apparently a mere\nuseless burden, becoming the sole protector, support, and adviser of\nthe lovers who were both young, beautiful, and strong. His remarkably\nnoble and austere expression struck Morrel, who began his story with\ntrembling. He related the manner in which he had become acquainted with\nValentine, and how he had loved her, and that Valentine, in her\nsolitude and her misfortune, had accepted the offer of his devotion. He\ntold him his birth, his position, his fortune, and more than once, when\nhe consulted the look of the paralytic, that look answered, “That is\ngood, proceed.”\n\n“And now,” said Morrel, when he had finished the first part of his\nrecital, “now I have told you of my love and my hopes, may I inform you\nof my intentions?”\n\n“Yes,” signified the old man. “This was our resolution; a cabriolet was in waiting at the gate, in\nwhich I intended to carry off Valentine to my sister’s house, to marry\nher, and to wait respectfully M. de Villefort’s pardon.”\n\n“No,” said Noirtier. “We must not do so?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“You do not sanction our project?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“There is another way,” said Morrel.

I will tell him the ties which bind me\nto Mademoiselle Valentine; if he be a sensible man, he will prove it by\nrenouncing of his own accord the hand of his betrothed, and will secure\nmy friendship, and love until death; if he refuse, either through\ninterest or ridiculous pride, after I have proved to him that he would\nbe forcing my wife from me, that Valentine loves me, and will have no\nother, I will fight with him, give him every advantage, and I shall\nkill him, or he will kill me; if I am victorious, he will not marry\nValentine, and if I die, I am very sure Valentine will not marry him.”\n\nNoirtier watched, with indescribable pleasure, this noble and sincere\ncountenance, on which every sentiment his tongue uttered was depicted,\nadding by the expression of his fine features all that coloring adds to\na sound and faithful drawing.", "similarity": 0.6276345252990723}]}

Some of the natives, the friends and\npartisans of Kai-Koumou, had stopped suddenly at the command of their\nchief, and had protected the captives. [Sidenote: THE TORTURES OF SUSPENSE.] Glenarvan, however, was not blind to the fate that was reserved for\nhim. Only his death could atone for the murder of a chief. Among savage\nraces death is always preceded by a protracted torture. He therefore\nexpected to cruelly expiate the righteous indignation that had nerved\nhis arm, but hoped that Kai-Koumou's rage would fall only on himself. What a night he and his companions passed! Who could depict their\nanguish, or measure their sufferings? Neither poor Robert nor brave\nPaganel had reappeared. But how could they doubt their fate? Were they\nnot the first victims of the natives' vengeance? All hope had vanished\neven from the heart of the major, who did not easily despair. John\nMangles felt himself growing mad at sight of the sad dejection of Mary\nGrant, thus separated from her brother. Glenarvan thought of that\nterrible request of Lady Helena, who, rather than yield to torture or\nslavery, preferred to die by his hand. Could he summon this fearful\ncourage? As for an escape, that was plainly impossible. Ten warriors,\narmed to the teeth, guarded the entrance of the temple. Morning came at last. There had been no communication between the\nnatives and the prisoners. The hut contained a considerable quantity\nof food, which the unfortunates scarcely touched. Hunger gave place to\ngrief. The day passed without bringing a change or a hope. Doubtless\nthe hour for the dead chief's funeral and their torture would be the\nsame. However, although Glenarvan concluded that Kai-Koumou must have\nabandoned all idea of exchange, the major on this point retained a\ngleam of hope. \"Who knows,\" said he, reminding Glenarvan of the effect produced upon\nthe chief by the death of Kara-Tété,--\"who knows but that Kai-Koumou in\nreality feels obliged to you?\" But, in spite of these observations, Glenarvan would no longer hope. The next day also passed away without the preparations for torture\nbeing made. The reason of the delay was this. The Maoris believe that the soul, for three days after death, inhabits\nthe body of the deceased, and therefore during this time the corpse\nremains unburied. This custom was rigorously observed, and for two days\nthe pah was deserted. Captain Mangles frequently stood on Wilson's\nshoulders and surveyed the fortification. No native was seen; only the\nsentinels guarded in turn at the door of their prison. But on the third day the huts were opened. The savages, men, women,\nand children, to the number of several hundreds, assembled in the pah,\nsilent and calm.", "similarity": 0.46370160579681396}, {"chunk_id": 154, "text": "The air was heavy with stifling mists.

The sombre arch of the great trees sheltered the tent of the\ntravelers. Provided no rain fell, they would have no reason to complain. Ayrton succeeded with difficulty in extricating his three oxen from\nthe mud, in which they had by this time sunk to their flanks. The\nquartermaster picketed them with the four horses, and would allow no\none to give them their fodder. This service he performed himself with\ngreat exactness, and that evening Glenarvan observed that his care was\nredoubled, for which he thanked him, as the preservation of the team\nwas of paramount importance. Meantime, the travelers partook of a hasty supper. Fatigue and heat had\ndriven away hunger, and they needed rest more than nourishment. Lady\nHelena and Miss Grant, wishing their companions good-night, retired to\ntheir accustomed bedroom. As for the men, some crawled under the tent,\nwhile others stretched themselves on the thick grass at the foot of the\ntrees. Gradually each sank into a heavy sleep. The darkness increased beneath\nthe curtain of dense clouds that covered the sky. Not a breath of\nair was felt. The silence of the night was only interrupted by the\noccasional howlings of wild animals. About eleven o'clock, after an uneasy slumber, the major awoke. His\nhalf-closed eyes were attracted by a dim light that flickered beneath\nthe great trees. One would have thought it was a whitish sheet\nglittering like the surface of a lake. MacNabb imagined, at first, that\nthe flames of a conflagration were spreading over the ground. [Sidenote: STRANGE SIGHTS AND SOUNDS.] He rose and walked towards the wood. His surprise was great when\nhe found himself in the presence of a purely natural phenomenon. Before him extended an immense field of mushrooms, which emitted\nphosphorescent flashes. The major, who was not selfish, was about to waken Paganel, that the\ngeographer might witness the spectacle with his own eyes, when an\nunexpected sight stopped him. The phosphorescent light illumined the wood for the space of half a\nmile, and MacNabb thought he saw shadows rapidly moving along the edge\nof the clearing. Did his eyes deceive him? Was he the sport of an\nillusion? He crouched down, and, after a long and attentive observation,\ndistinctly perceived several men, who seemed by their movements to be\nsearching the ground for something. What could these men want? He must\nknow, and, without an instant's hesitation or awakening his companions,\nhe crawled along on all-fours, carefully concealing himself in the tall\ngrass. CHAPTER XL. A STARTLING DISCOVERY. [Sidenote: INCREASING PERPLEXITIES.] It was a terrible night. At two o'clock in the morning the rain began\nto fall in torrents, which continued to pour from the stormy clouds\ntill daylight. The tent was an insufficient shelter. Glenarvan and\nhis companions took refuge in the cart, where they passed the time\nin conversing upon various subjects. The major, however, whose short\nabsence no one had noticed, contented himself with listening in\nsilence. The fury of the tempest gave them considerable uneasiness,\nsince it might cause an inundation, by which the cart, fast in the\nmire, would be overwhelmed.

It was the hand of a woman or a youth, a European hand. Not a word had\nbeen uttered on either side. There was plainly an object in keeping\nsilent. \"Is it Robert?\" murmured Glenarvan. But, though only whispering this name, Mary Grant, awakened by the\nmovement that was taking place in the hut, glided towards Glenarvan,\nand, seizing this hand all soiled with mud, covered it with kisses. \"It is you! it is you!\" cried the young girl, who could not be\nmistaken, \"you, my Robert!\" \"Yes, little sister,\" replied Robert, \"I am here to save you all! But\nsilence!\" \"Brave lad!\" repeated Glenarvan. \"Keep watch of the savages outside,\" continued Robert. Mulready, whose attention had been diverted for a moment by the\nappearance of the hand, resumed his post of observation. \"All is well,\" said he. \"Only four warriors are watching now. The\nothers have fallen asleep.\" \"Courage!\" replied Wilson. In an instant the hole was widened, and Robert passed from the arms of\nhis sister into those of Lady Helena. Around his body was wound a rope\nof flax. \"My boy! my boy!\" murmured Lady Helena; \"these savages did not kill\nyou?\" \"No, madam,\" replied Robert. \"Somehow, during the uproar, I succeeded\nin escaping their vigilance. I crossed the yard. For two days I kept\nhidden behind the bushes. At night I wandered about, longing to see you\nagain. While the tribe were occupied with the funeral of the chief,\nI came and examined this side of the fortification, where the prison\nstands, and saw that I could reach you. I stole this knife and rope\nin a deserted hut. The tufts of grass and the bushes helped me to\nclimb. By chance I found a kind of grotto hollowed out in the very rock\nagainst which this hut rests. I had only a few feet to dig in the soft\nearth, and here I am.\" Twenty silent kisses were his only answer. \"Let us start,\" said he, in a decided tone. \"Is Paganel below?\" inquired Glenarvan. \"Mr. Paganel?\" repeated the boy, surprised apparently at the question. \"Yes; is he waiting for us?\" \"No, my lord. What! is he not here?\" \"He is not, Robert,\" replied Mary Grant. \"What! have you not seen him?\" exclaimed Glenarvan. \"Did you not meet\neach other in the confusion? Did you not escape together?\" \"No, my lord,\" answered Robert, at a loss to understand the\ndisappearance of his friend Paganel. \"Let us start,\" said the major; \"there is not a moment to lose. Wherever Paganel may be, his situation cannot be worse than ours here. Let us go.\" Indeed, the moments were precious. It was high time to start. The escape presented no great difficulties, but for the almost\nperpendicular wall of rock outside of the grotto, twenty feet high. The\ndeclivity then sloped quite gently to the base of the mountain, from\nwhich point the captives could quickly gain the lower valleys, while\nthe Maoris, if they chanced to discover their flight, would be forced\nto make a very long détour, since they were not aware of the passage\nthat had been dug in the mountain. [Illustration: First her husband, and then she, slid down the rope to\nthe point where the perpendicular wall met the summit of the slope.] They now prepared to escape, and every precaution was taken to insure\ntheir success.

Of what use can\nhe be?\" \"To give us the information we need for our journey,\" replied\nGlenarvan. \"Let us go in.\" Glenarvan, followed by Ayrton, entered the tavern. The landlord of\n\"Bush Inn\" was a coarse man, of forbidding appearance, who had to\nconsider himself as the principal customer for the gin, brandy, and\nwhisky of his tavern, and scarcely ever saw any one but squatters or\nherdsmen. He replied in an ill-humored way to the questions that were addressed\nhim; but his answers sufficed to determine Ayrton upon his course. Glenarvan, however, remunerated the tavern-keeper for the little\ntrouble they had given him, and was about to leave the inn, when a\nplacard, affixed to the wall, attracted his attention. It was a notice\nof the colonial police, detailing the escape of the convicts from\nPerth, and setting a price upon the head of Ben Joyce--a hundred pounds\nsterling to any one who should deliver him up. \"Indeed,\" said Glenarvan, \"that is a rascal worth hanging.\" \"And especially worth taking,\" replied Ayrton. \"A hundred pounds! What\na sum! He is not worth it.\" \"As for the inn-keeper,\" added Glenarvan, as he left the room, \"I\nscarcely put faith in him, despite his placard.\" \"Nor I either,\" said Ayrton. Glenarvan and the quartermaster rejoined the party, and they all\nproceeded to where a narrow pass wound across the chain. Here they\nbegan the ascent. [Sidenote: ANOTHER DEATH.] But it was an arduous task. More than once the ladies and their\ncompanions had to dismount, and it was often necessary to push the\nwheels of the heavy vehicle at some steep ascent, or to hold it\nback along the edge of some dangerous precipice. The oxen, as they\ncould not work to advantage at sudden turns, had frequently to be\nunyoked, and the cart blocked to prevent it from sliding back. Ayrton\nwas repeatedly forced to bring the already exhausted horses to his\nassistance. Whether this exertion was too prolonged, or whether from some other\ncause, one of the horses gave out during the ascent. He fell suddenly,\nwithout an instant's warning. It was Mulready's horse; and when the\nsailor attempted to help him up, he found that he was dead. Ayrton\nexamined the animal carefully, but did not seem to understand the cause\nof this sudden death. \"The beast must have burst a blood-vessel,\" said Glenarvan. \"Evidently,\" replied Ayrton. \"Take my horse, Mulready,\" added Glenarvan; \"I will join Lady Helena in\nthe cart.\" Mulready obeyed, and the little party continued their fatiguing ascent,\nabandoning the body to the crows. The next day they began the descent, which was much more rapid. During\nits course a violent hail-storm burst on them, and they were forced to\nseek a shelter beneath the rocks. Not hailstones, but pieces of ice as\nlarge as one's hand, were precipitated from the angry clouds. A sling\ncould not have hurled them with greater force, and several sharp blows\nwarned Paganel and Robert to be on their guard. The cart was pierced\nthrough in many places: indeed, few roofs could have resisted the fall\nof these cutting missiles, some of which froze to the trunks of the\ntrees.", "similarity": 0.5611032247543335}, {"chunk_id": 95, "text": "The dead limbs, the nests of dry grass, and finally the live wood\nitself, furnished material for the devouring element. The wind now rose and fanned the flames into fury. Glenarvan and his\nfriends, speechless with terror, and venturing upon limbs that bent\nbeneath their weight, hastily took refuge in the other, the eastern\npart of the tree. Meantime the boughs shriveled, crackled, and twisted in the fire like\nburning serpents. The glowing fragments fell into the rushing waters\nand floated away in the current, sending forth flashes of ruddy light. The flames at one moment would rise to a fearful height, to be lost\nin the aerial conflagration, and the next, beaten back by the furious\nhurricane, would envelop the tree like a robe of molten gold. Glenarvan, Robert, the major, Paganel, and the sailors, were terrified. A thick smoke was stifling them; an intolerable heat was scorching\nthem. The fire was extending to the lower part of the tree on their\nside; nothing could stop or extinguish it; and they felt themselves\nirrevocably doomed to the torture of those victims who are confined\nwithin the burning sides of a sacrificial fire-basket. At last their situation was no longer tenable, and of two deaths they\nwere forced to choose the least cruel. \"To the water!\" cried Glenarvan. [Illustration: In a few moments the gigantic water-spout struck the\nombu, and enveloped it in its watery folds.] Wilson, whom the flames had reached, had already plunged into the\ncurrent, when they heard him cry, in tones of the greatest terror,--\n\n\"Help! help!\" Austin rushed towards him and assisted him to regain the trunk. \"What is the matter?\" \"Caymans! caymans!\" replied Wilson. And, in truth, the foot of the\ntree was seen to be surrounded by the most formidable monsters. Their scales glittered in broad plates of light, sharply defined\nby the conflagration. Their flat tails, their pointed heads, their\nprotruding eyes, their jaws, extending back of their ears, all these\ncharacteristic signs were unmistakable. Paganel recognized the\nvoracious alligators peculiar to America, and called caymans in Spanish\ncountries. There were a dozen of them, beating the water with their\npowerful tails, and attacking the tree with their terrible teeth. At this sight the unfortunate travelers felt themselves lost indeed. A\nhorrible death was in store for them,--to perish either by the flames\nor by the teeth of the alligators. There are circumstances in which\nman is powerless to struggle, and where a raging element can only be\nrepulsed by another equally strong. Glenarvan, with a wild look, gazed\nat the fire and water leagued against him, not knowing what aid to\nimplore of Heaven. The storm had now begun to abate; but it had developed in the air a\ngreat quantity of vapor, which the electric phenomena were about to\nset in violent commotion. To the south an enormous water-spout was\ngradually forming,--an inverted cone of mist, uniting the raging waters\nbelow to the stormy clouds above. It advanced revolving with frightful\nrapidity, collected at its centre a liquid column, and by a powerful\nattraction, caused by its gyratory motion, drew towards it all the\nsurrounding currents of air. [Sidenote: A STRANGE BARK.] In a few moments the gigantic water-spout struck the ombu and enveloped\nit in its watery folds.

Glenarvan, Paganel, the major, and Captain Mangles mingled with the\ncrowd, and listened to the conjectures that passed from one to another. Each sought to explain the catastrophe, while laboring to save what was\nleft. \"The bridge has broken,\" said one. [Sidenote: CAUSES AND EFFECTS.] \"Broken?\" replied others. \"That cannot be, for it is still uninjured. They forgot to close it for the passage of the train, that is all.\" It was a draw-bridge, which had been constructed for the convenience of\nthe shipping. Had the man on guard, through unpardonable negligence,\nforgotten to close it, and thus precipitated the train, at full speed,\ninto the bed of the Lutton? This supposition seemed plausible, for one\nhalf of the bridge lay beneath the fragments of the cars, while the\nother still hung intact in its chains. Doubt was no longer possible;\nsurely carelessness must have caused the calamity. The accident had happened to the night express, which left Melbourne\nat forty-five minutes past eleven. It must have been a quarter-past\nthree in the morning when the train reached Camden Bridge, where this\nterrible destruction of life and property took place. The travelers\nand employés of the last car at once busied themselves in seeking\nassistance; but the telegraph-wires, whose poles lay on the ground,\nwere no longer available. It took the authorities of Castlemaine three\nhours to reach the scene of the disaster; and it was, therefore, six\no'clock in the morning before a corps of workers was organized under\nthe direction of the surveyor-general of the district, and a detachment\nof policemen, commanded by an officer. The squatters had come to their\naid, and exerted themselves to extinguish the fire, which consumed the\nheap of ruins with unconquerable fierceness. Several unrecognizable\nbodies lay on the edge of the embankment, but it was impossible\nto rescue a living being from this furnace. The fire had rapidly\naccomplished the work of destruction. Of the travelers in the train,\nwhose number was not known, only ten survived, those in the last car. The railroad company had just sent an extra locomotive to convey them\nto Castlemaine. Meantime, Lord Glenarvan, having made the acquaintance of the\nsurveyor-general, was conversing with him and the police-officer. The\nlatter was a tall, thin man, of imperturbable coolness, who, if he\nhad any feeling, betrayed no sign of it on his impassible features. He was like a mathematician engaged upon a problem; he was seeking to\nelucidate the mystery of the disaster. To Glenarvan's first words,\n\"This is a great calamity!\" he replied, calmly, \"It is more than that.\" \"More than that!\" cried Glenarvan; \"and what can be more than that?\" \"It is a crime!\" replied the officer, coolly. Glenarvan turned to Mr. Mitchell, the surveyor-general, with a\nquestioning look. \"That is correct,\" said the latter; \"our examination has convinced us\nthat the catastrophe is the result of a crime.

As soon as he arrived at the bay, he was to\nsend a detachment of sailors under the command of Ayrton. He had just reached this part of his letter, when the major, who had\nbeen looking over his shoulder, asked him, in a singular tone, how he\nwrote the word Ayrton. \"As it is pronounced,\" replied Glenarvan. \"That is a mistake,\" said the major coolly. \"It is pronounced Ayrton,\nbut it is written 'Ben Joyce'!\" CHAPTER XLI. THE PLOT UNVEILED. The sound of the name of Ben Joyce fell upon the party like a\nthunderbolt. Ayrton suddenly sprang to his feet. In his hand was a\nrevolver. A report was heard; and Glenarvan fell, struck by a bullet. Before Captain Mangles and the sailors recovered from the surprise into\nwhich this unexpected turn of affairs had thrown them, the audacious\nconvict had escaped, and joined his band, scattered along the edge of\nthe wood of gum-trees. [Illustration: A report was heard; and Glenarvan fell, struck by a\nbullet.] The tent did not offer a sufficient shelter against the bullets, and\nit was clearly necessary to beat a retreat. Glenarvan, who was but\nslightly injured, had risen. \"To the cart! to the cart!\" cried Captain Mangles, as he hurried on\nLady Helena and Mary Grant, who were soon in safety behind its stout\nsides. The captain, the major, Paganel, and the sailors then seized their\nrifles, and stood ready to repel the convicts. Glenarvan and Robert had\njoined the ladies, while Olbinett hastened to the common defence. These events had transpired with the rapidity of lightning. Captain\nMangles attentively watched the edge of the wood; but the reports\nsuddenly ceased on the arrival of Ben Joyce, and a profound silence\nsucceeded the noisy fusillade. A few wreaths of white smoke were still\ncurling up between the branches of the gum-trees, but the tall tufts of\ngastrolobium were motionless and all signs of attack had disappeared. The major and Captain Mangles extended their examinations as far as the\ngreat trees. The place was abandoned. Numerous footprints were seen,\nand a few half-burnt cartridges smoked on the ground. The major, like\na prudent man, extinguished them, for a spark was enough to kindle a\nformidable conflagration in this forest of dry trees. \"The convicts have disappeared,\" said Captain Mangles. \"Yes,\" replied the major; \"and this disappearance alarms me. I should\nprefer to meet them face to face. It is better to encounter a tiger in\nthe open plain than a serpent in the grass. Let us search these bushes\naround the cart.\" [Sidenote: UNRAVELINGS.] The major and captain scoured the surrounding country. But from the\nedge of the wood to the banks of the Snowy they did not meet with a\nsingle convict. Ben Joyce's band seemed to have flown away, like a\nflock of mischievous birds. This disappearance was too strange to\ninspire a perfect security. They therefore resolved to keep on the\nwatch.

FRESH FACES. They had not proceeded far before they reached a native cemetery,\npleasantly situated and with abundance of shady trees. Here for a\ntime they halted, and, whilst Robert and Paganel were exploring, Lord\nand Lady Glenarvan almost stumbled over a queer object. It was human,\nindigenous, and sleeping; but at first this was all that they could\ndecide, until, as the eyes opened and the sleeper roused to active\nlife, they saw before them a boy of eight years, with a notice pinned\nto the back of his jacket which read as follows: \"TOLINÉ*, to be\nconducted to Echuca, care of Jeff Smith, Railway Porter.

He\nhad been educated in the Wesleyan Methodist day-school at Melbourne,\nand was now going for a time to visit his parents, who were living\nwith the rest of their tribe in Lachlan. He had been in the train to\nwhich the accident had happened, and had, with childlike confidence,\ntroubled less about his fate than did those of older years. Going to a\nlittle distance, and laying himself on the grass, he had soon fallen\ninto the slumber from which our travelers had aroused him. [Illustration: Paganel and the others had now gathered round, and\nToliné had to answer many a question. He came out of his examination\nvery creditably.] Paganel and the others had now gathered round, and Toliné had to answer\nmany a question. He came out of his examination very creditably; the\nreverence with which he spoke of the Creator and of the Bible produced\na very favorable impression on the Scottish heads of the expedition,\nwhilst the fact that he had taken \"the first prize in geography\" was\nsufficient introduction to Monsieur Paganel, who forthwith tested his\nknowledge, greatly to his own satisfaction, and considerably to the\ncredit of his young pupil. The curiosity of his discoverers having been\nfully satisfied, Toliné was made welcome, and partook with the others\nof the general repast. Many were the plans and purposes concerning\nhim, and much wonder was expressed as to how they could speed him on\nhis way; but in the morning it was discovered that he had solved the\nproblem for himself, and a bouquet of fresh leaves and flowers, laid by\nthe side of Lady Helena's seat, was the only memento that Toliné had\nleft.

His past had\njust been reviewed by the major, and the wretch appeared as he was,--a\nbold and formidable criminal. His intentions had been clearly proved,\nand required, on the part of Glenarvan, extreme vigilance. Fortunately,\nthere was less to fear from the detected bandit than the secret traitor. But one serious fact appeared from this explanation. No one had yet\nthought of it; only Mary Grant, disregarding the past, looked forward\nto the future. Captain Mangles first saw her pale and disconsolate.

Ayrton succeeded with difficulty in extricating his three oxen from\nthe mud, in which they had by this time sunk to their flanks. The\nquartermaster picketed them with the four horses, and would allow no\none to give them their fodder. This service he performed himself with\ngreat exactness, and that evening Glenarvan observed that his care was\nredoubled, for which he thanked him, as the preservation of the team\nwas of paramount importance. Meantime, the travelers partook of a hasty supper. Fatigue and heat had\ndriven away hunger, and they needed rest more than nourishment. Lady\nHelena and Miss Grant, wishing their companions good-night, retired to\ntheir accustomed bedroom. As for the men, some crawled under the tent,\nwhile others stretched themselves on the thick grass at the foot of the\ntrees. Gradually each sank into a heavy sleep. The darkness increased beneath\nthe curtain of dense clouds that covered the sky. Not a breath of\nair was felt. The silence of the night was only interrupted by the\noccasional howlings of wild animals. About eleven o'clock, after an uneasy slumber, the major awoke. His\nhalf-closed eyes were attracted by a dim light that flickered beneath\nthe great trees. One would have thought it was a whitish sheet\nglittering like the surface of a lake. MacNabb imagined, at first, that\nthe flames of a conflagration were spreading over the ground. [Sidenote: STRANGE SIGHTS AND SOUNDS.] He rose and walked towards the wood. His surprise was great when\nhe found himself in the presence of a purely natural phenomenon. Before him extended an immense field of mushrooms, which emitted\nphosphorescent flashes. The major, who was not selfish, was about to waken Paganel, that the\ngeographer might witness the spectacle with his own eyes, when an\nunexpected sight stopped him. The phosphorescent light illumined the wood for the space of half a\nmile, and MacNabb thought he saw shadows rapidly moving along the edge\nof the clearing. Did his eyes deceive him? Was he the sport of an\nillusion? He crouched down, and, after a long and attentive observation,\ndistinctly perceived several men, who seemed by their movements to be\nsearching the ground for something. What could these men want? He must\nknow, and, without an instant's hesitation or awakening his companions,\nhe crawled along on all-fours, carefully concealing himself in the tall\ngrass. CHAPTER XL. A STARTLING DISCOVERY. [Sidenote: INCREASING PERPLEXITIES.] It was a terrible night. At two o'clock in the morning the rain began\nto fall in torrents, which continued to pour from the stormy clouds\ntill daylight. The tent was an insufficient shelter. Glenarvan and\nhis companions took refuge in the cart, where they passed the time\nin conversing upon various subjects. The major, however, whose short\nabsence no one had noticed, contented himself with listening in\nsilence.

As soon as he arrived at the bay, he was to\nsend a detachment of sailors under the command of Ayrton. He had just reached this part of his letter, when the major, who had\nbeen looking over his shoulder, asked him, in a singular tone, how he\nwrote the word Ayrton. \"As it is pronounced,\" replied Glenarvan. \"That is a mistake,\" said the major coolly. \"It is pronounced Ayrton,\nbut it is written 'Ben Joyce'!\" CHAPTER XLI.

These were spectres, not the bold\nand dashing travelers whom, three months before, hope had stimulated to\na search for the shipwrecked captain. Chance alone had led them back to\nthis vessel that they had ceased to regard as theirs, and in what a sad\nstate of exhaustion and feebleness! However, before thinking of fatigue, or the imperative calls of hunger\nand thirst, Glenarvan questioned Tom Austin concerning his presence in\nthese waters. Why was the Duncan on the eastern coast of New Zealand? Why was she not in the hands of Ben Joyce? By what providential working\nhad God restored her to the fugitives? These were the questions that\nwere hurriedly addressed to Tom Austin. The old sailor did not know\nwhich to answer first. He therefore concluded to listen only to Lord\nGlenarvan, and reply to him. \"But the convicts?\" inquired Glenarvan. \"What have you done with the\nconvicts?\" \"The convicts!\" replied Tom Austin, like a man who is at a loss to\nunderstand a question. \"Yes; the wretches who attacked the yacht.\" \"What yacht, my lord? The Duncan?\" \"Of course. Did not Ben Joyce come on board?\" \"I do not know Ben Joyce; I have never seen him.\" \"Never?\" cried Glenarvan, amazed at the answers of the old sailor. \"Then will you tell me why the Duncan is now on the shores of New\nZealand?\" [Sidenote: MYSTERY MORE MYSTERIOUS!] Although Glenarvan and his friends did not at all understand Austin's\nastonishment, what was their surprise when he replied, in a calm voice:\n\n\"The Duncan is here by your lordship's orders.\" \"By my orders?\" cried Glenarvan. \"Yes, my lord. I only conformed to the instructions contained in your\nletter.\" \"My letter?\" exclaimed Glenarvan. The ten travelers at once surrounded Tom Austin, and gazed at him in\neager curiosity. The letter written at the Snowy River had reached the\nDuncan. \"Well,\" continued Glenarvan, \"let us have an explanation; for I almost\nthink I am dreaming. You received a letter, Tom?\" \"Yes; a letter from your lordship.\" \"At Melbourne?\" \"At Melbourne; just as I had finished the repair of the ship.\" \"And this letter?\" \"It was not written by you; but it was signed by you, my lord.\" \"Exactly; it was sent by a convict, Ben Joyce.\" \"No; by the sailor called Ayrton, quartermaster of the Britannia.\" \"Yes, Ayrton or Ben Joyce; it is the same person. Well, what did the\nletter say?\" \"It ordered me to leave Melbourne without delay, and come to the\neastern shores of----\"\n\n\"Australia!\" cried Glenarvan, with an impetuosity that disconcerted the\nold sailor. \"Australia?\" repeated Tom, opening his eyes. \"No, indeed; New Zealand!\" \"Australia, Tom! Australia!\" replied Glenarvan's companions, with one\nvoice. [Illustration: As soon as they set foot on deck the bagpiper struck up\na well remembered air, while hearty hurrahs welcomed the owner's return\non board.] Austin was now bewildered. Glenarvan spoke with such assurance, that\nhe feared he had made a mistake in reading the letter. Could he,\nfaithful and accurate sailor that he was, have committed such a\nblunder? He began to feel troubled.

Kai-Koumou, according to a custom quite ordinary in New Zealand, joined\nthe rank of priest to that of chief, and could, therefore, extend to\npersons or objects the superstitious protection of the taboo. The taboo, which is common to the tribes of Polynesia, has the power\nto prohibit at once all connection with the object or person tabooed. According to the Maori religion, whoever should lay his sacrilegious\nhand on what is declared taboo would be punished with death by the\noffended god; and in case the divinity should delay to avenge his own\ninsult, the priests would not fail to excite his anger. As for the prisoners confined in the temple, the taboo had rescued\nthem from the fury of the tribe. Some of the natives, the friends and\npartisans of Kai-Koumou, had stopped suddenly at the command of their\nchief, and had protected the captives. [Sidenote: THE TORTURES OF SUSPENSE.] Glenarvan, however, was not blind to the fate that was reserved for\nhim. Only his death could atone for the murder of a chief. Among savage\nraces death is always preceded by a protracted torture. He therefore\nexpected to cruelly expiate the righteous indignation that had nerved\nhis arm, but hoped that Kai-Koumou's rage would fall only on himself. What a night he and his companions passed! Who could depict their\nanguish, or measure their sufferings? Neither poor Robert nor brave\nPaganel had reappeared. But how could they doubt their fate? Were they\nnot the first victims of the natives' vengeance? All hope had vanished\neven from the heart of the major, who did not easily despair. John\nMangles felt himself growing mad at sight of the sad dejection of Mary\nGrant, thus separated from her brother. Glenarvan thought of that\nterrible request of Lady Helena, who, rather than yield to torture or\nslavery, preferred to die by his hand. Could he summon this fearful\ncourage? As for an escape, that was plainly impossible. Ten warriors,\narmed to the teeth, guarded the entrance of the temple. Morning came at last. There had been no communication between the\nnatives and the prisoners. The hut contained a considerable quantity\nof food, which the unfortunates scarcely touched. Hunger gave place to\ngrief. The day passed without bringing a change or a hope. Doubtless\nthe hour for the dead chief's funeral and their torture would be the\nsame. However, although Glenarvan concluded that Kai-Koumou must have\nabandoned all idea of exchange, the major on this point retained a\ngleam of hope. \"Who knows,\" said he, reminding Glenarvan of the effect produced upon\nthe chief by the death of Kara-Tété,--\"who knows but that Kai-Koumou in\nreality feels obliged to you?\" But, in spite of these observations, Glenarvan would no longer hope. The next day also passed away without the preparations for torture\nbeing made. The reason of the delay was this. The Maoris believe that the soul, for three days after death, inhabits\nthe body of the deceased, and therefore during this time the corpse\nremains unburied. This custom was rigorously observed, and for two days\nthe pah was deserted. Captain Mangles frequently stood on Wilson's\nshoulders and surveyed the fortification. No native was seen; only the\nsentinels guarded in turn at the door of their prison. But on the third day the huts were opened. The savages, men, women,\nand children, to the number of several hundreds, assembled in the pah,\nsilent and calm.", "similarity": 0.4010412096977234}]}

Why, it is also impossible for me to\nsay.

A fit of laughter seized the\nwhole crew. Paganel, as if mad, ran to and fro, holding his head in his\nhands, and tearing his hair. However, when he had recovered from his\nfrenzy, there was still another unavoidable question to answer. \"Now, Paganel,\" said Glenarvan, \"be candid.

Moreover, if I deceive you, you will\nalways have the power to revenge yourself.\" \"How?\" \"By recapturing me on this island, from which I shall not be able to\nescape.\" Ayrton had a reply for everything. He met all difficulties, and\nproduced unanswerable arguments against himself. As was seen, he\nstrove to treat in his business with good faith. It was impossible for\na person to surrender with more perfect confidence, and yet he found\nmeans to advance still further in this disinterested course. \"My lord and gentlemen,\" added he, \"I desire that you should be\nconvinced that I am honorable.

The landlord of\n\"Bush Inn\" was a coarse man, of forbidding appearance, who had to\nconsider himself as the principal customer for the gin, brandy, and\nwhisky of his tavern, and scarcely ever saw any one but squatters or\nherdsmen. He replied in an ill-humored way to the questions that were addressed\nhim; but his answers sufficed to determine Ayrton upon his course. Glenarvan, however, remunerated the tavern-keeper for the little\ntrouble they had given him, and was about to leave the inn, when a\nplacard, affixed to the wall, attracted his attention. It was a notice\nof the colonial police, detailing the escape of the convicts from\nPerth, and setting a price upon the head of Ben Joyce--a hundred pounds\nsterling to any one who should deliver him up. \"Indeed,\" said Glenarvan, \"that is a rascal worth hanging.\" \"And especially worth taking,\" replied Ayrton. \"A hundred pounds!

More than once the ladies and their\ncompanions had to dismount, and it was often necessary to push the\nwheels of the heavy vehicle at some steep ascent, or to hold it\nback along the edge of some dangerous precipice. The oxen, as they\ncould not work to advantage at sudden turns, had frequently to be\nunyoked, and the cart blocked to prevent it from sliding back. Ayrton\nwas repeatedly forced to bring the already exhausted horses to his\nassistance. Whether this exertion was too prolonged, or whether from some other\ncause, one of the horses gave out during the ascent. He fell suddenly,\nwithout an instant's warning. It was Mulready's horse; and when the\nsailor attempted to help him up, he found that he was dead. Ayrton\nexamined the animal carefully, but did not seem to understand the cause\nof this sudden death. \"The beast must have burst a blood-vessel,\" said Glenarvan. \"Evidently,\" replied Ayrton. \"Take my horse, Mulready,\" added Glenarvan; \"I will join Lady Helena in\nthe cart.\" Mulready obeyed, and the little party continued their fatiguing ascent,\nabandoning the body to the crows. The next day they began the descent, which was much more rapid. During\nits course a violent hail-storm burst on them, and they were forced to\nseek a shelter beneath the rocks. Not hailstones, but pieces of ice as\nlarge as one's hand, were precipitated from the angry clouds. A sling\ncould not have hurled them with greater force, and several sharp blows\nwarned Paganel and Robert to be on their guard. The cart was pierced\nthrough in many places: indeed, few roofs could have resisted the fall\nof these cutting missiles, some of which froze to the trunks of the\ntrees.", "similarity": 0.39661848545074463}]}

A year after his arrival\nin the country, Sergeant Manuel was naturalized, joined the Argentine\narmy, and married an honest Indian woman, who had twins,--boys, to be\nsure, for the sergeant's worthy consort would never present him with\ndaughters. Manuel did not think of any other calling than that of the\nsoldier, and hoped, in time, with the help of God, to offer to the\nrepublic a whole battalion of young soldiers. \"You have seen them?\" said he. \"Charming fellows! Good soldiers! José! Juan! Miguel! Pepe! Pepe is only seven years old, and is already biting\nhis cartridge!\" Pepe, hearing himself complimented, joined his two little feet, and\npresented arms with perfect precision. \"He will do!\" added the sergeant. \"He will be a major--or\nbrigadier-general one day!\" This story lasted a quarter of an hour, to Thalcave's great\nastonishment. The Indian could not understand how so many words could\ncome from a single throat. No one interrupted the commander; and even\na French sergeant had to conclude at last, though not without forcing\nhis guests to accompany him to his dwelling. Here they were introduced\nto Madame Ipharaguerre, who appeared to be \"a good-looking person,\" if\nthis expression may be employed in regard to an Indian. When he had exhausted himself, the sergeant asked his guests to what he\nowed the honor of their visit. And now it was their turn to explain. Paganel, opening the conversation in French, told him of their journey\nacross the Pampas, and ended by asking why the Indians had abandoned\nthe country. \"War!\" replied the sergeant. \"War?\" \"Yes, civil war.\" \"Civil war?\" rejoined Paganel. \"Yes, war between Paraguay and Buenos Ayres,\" answered the sergeant. \"Well?\" \"Why, all the Indians of the north are in the rear of General Flores,\nand those of the plains are plundering.\" \"But the caziques?\" \"The caziques with them.\" This answer was reported to Thalcave, who shook his head. Indeed,\nhe either did not know, or had forgotten, that a civil war, which\nwas afterwards to involve Brazil, was decimating two-thirds of the\nrepublic. The Indians had everything to gain in these internal\nstruggles, and could not neglect such fine opportunities for plunder. The sergeant, therefore, was not mistaken in attributing this desertion\nof the Pampas to the civil war that was being waged in the northern\npart of the Argentine Provinces. But this event disconcerted Glenarvan's hopes. If Captain Grant was\na prisoner of the caziques, he must have been carried by them to the\nnorthern frontiers. Yet how and where to find him? Must they attempt\na perilous and almost useless search to the northern limits of the\nPampas? It was a serious matter, which was to be earnestly considered. However, one important question was still to be asked of the sergeant,\nand the major thought of this, while his companions were looking at\neach other in silence. \"Have you heard of any Europeans being retained as prisoners by the\ncaziques of the Pampas?\" Manuel reflected for a few moments, like a man who recalls events to\nrecollection. \"Yes,\" said he, at length. \"Ah!\" cried Glenarvan, conceiving a new hope. [Sidenote: REVELATIONS.] Paganel, MacNabb, Robert, and he now surrounded the sergeant. \"Speak, speak!\" cried they, gazing at him with eagerness even in their\nlooks. \"Several years ago,\" replied Manuel, \"yes,--that is it,--European\nprisoners--but have never seen them.\" \"Several years ago?\" said Glenarvan. \"You are mistaken.

Paganel also told, at great length, the tales of many of the sad\nincidents which from time to time have marked even the commercial\nintercourse between the European and the Maori; as, for instance, the\nsad tale of conflict and bloodshed connected with the death of Captain\nMarion, a French navigator, in 1772. He had landed near the spot where\nSurville had ill-treated some of the natives and traitorously seized\na son of the chief, Takouri, who yet appeared to welcome this next\nFrench visitant, though remembering none the less the terrible duty of\nvengeance which is felt by the Maori to be so binding. [Illustration: It was on the sixth of October, 1769, that this\nnavigator (Captain Cook) first landed on the shores.] For a long time the cloak of friendship was worn by the natives, the\nmore thoroughly to lull the suspicions of the whites, and to entice a\nlarger number on shore; in which endeavor they succeeded only too well. The French ships being greatly out of repair, Marion was induced to\nfell timber at some distance in the interior, and to establish in this\noccupation a great number of his men, going frequently to them, and\nremaining with them and the apparently friendly chiefs. On one of these\noccasions the Maoris fulfilled their revengeful project with a terrible\nsatisfaction to themselves. Only one man, of all those in the interior,\nmanaged to escape, the commander himself falling a prey to their\nvengeance. They then endeavored to kill the second in command, who,\nwith several others, was nearer to the shore. These, of course, at once\nstarted for their boats; breathless, they reached them, hotly pursued\nto the water's edge by the insatiate savages. Then, safe themselves,\nthe French marksmen picked off the chief, and the previous exultation\nof the aborigines was, even in the hour of their triumph, turned to\nlamentation, coupled with wonder at the terrible power of the white\nman's fire-barrel.

The sea was rough, the\nrigging creaked, the ribs cracked, and the vessel rode the waves with\ndifficulty. Fortunately, Will Halley, like a man who was in no hurry, did not crowd\non sail, or his masts would inevitably have snapped. Captain Mangles\nhoped, therefore, that this clumsy craft would reach its destination\nin safety; still, he was pained to see his companions on board in such\nmiserable quarters.

The grass became more and\nmore scanty, and gave place to sickly burdocks and gigantic thistles;\nwhile stunted nettles and other thorny shrubs grew here and there. Heretofore, a certain moisture, preserved by the clay of the prairie,\nfreshened the meadows; the vegetation was thick and luxuriant. But now\na patchy growth, bare in many places, exposed the earth, and indicated\nthe poverty of the soil. These signs of increasing dryness could not be\nmistaken, and Thalcave called attention to them. [Illustration]\n\n\"I am not sorry at this change,\" said Tom Austin; \"to see always grass,\nnothing but grass, becomes tiresome before long.\" \"But where there is grass there is water,\" replied the major. \"Oh, we are not in want,\" said Wilson, \"and shall find some river on\nour course.\" However, when Wilson said that the supply of water would not fail\nhe had not calculated for the unquenchable thirst that consumed his\ncompanions all that day; and, when he added that they would meet with\nsome stream in their journey he had anticipated too much. Indeed, not\nonly were rivers wanting, but even the artificial wells dug by the\nIndians were empty. On seeing these indications of dryness increase\nfrom mile to mile, Paganel asked Thalcave where he expected to find\nwater. \"At Lake Salinas,\" replied the Indian. \"And when shall we arrive there?\" \"To-morrow evening.\" The natives ordinarily, when they travel on the Pampas, dig wells, and\nfind water a few feet below the surface; but the travelers, destitute\nof the necessary implements, could not employ this expedient. It was\ntherefore necessary to obtain a supply in some other way, for, if they\ndid not absolutely suffer from the tormenting desire for drink, no one\ncould entirely allay his thirst. At evening they halted, after a journey of thirty miles. Every one\nrelied upon a good night to recruit himself after the fatigues of\nthe day; but they were greatly annoyed by a very persistent swarm of\nmosquitoes, which disappeared, however, after the wind changed. If the major preserved his calmness in the midst of the petty\nannoyances of life, Paganel, on the contrary, could not treat the\nmatter so indifferently. He fought the mosquitoes, and sadly regretted\nthe absence of his acid-water, which would have soothed the pain of\ntheir bites. Although the major endeavored to console him, he awoke in\na very bad humor. However, he was very easily persuaded to set out at daybreak, for it\nwas important to arrive at Lake Salinas the same day. The horses were\nvery much exhausted: they were dying of thirst; and, although their\nriders had denied themselves on their account, still their share of\nwater had been very limited. The dryness was to-day even greater, and\nthe heat no less intolerable, with the dusty wind, the simoom of the\nPampas. [Sidenote: INDIANS AHEAD!] During the day the monotony of the journey was interrupted. Mulready,\nwho rode in advance, turned back, signaling the approach of a party of\nIndians.

Vague words, lamentations, and broken phrases, in which she celebrated\nthe virtues of the dead, interrupted her groans; and, in a final\nparoxysm of grief, she stretched herself at the foot of the mound,\nbeating the ground with her head.

He took the boy in his arms, lifted him from his horse, and gazed at\nhim with the most curious sympathy. His intelligent countenance became\nsuffused with a peaceful emotion. But Paganel had not finished his inquiries. Where was this prisoner? What was he doing? When had Thalcave heard of him? All these questions\nthronged his mind at once. He did not have to wait long for answers,\nbut learnt that the European was a slave of one of the Indian tribes\nthat scour the plains. \"But where was he last?\" asked Paganel. \"With the cazique Calfoucoura,\" answered Thalcave. \"On the line we have been following?\" \"Yes.\" \"And who is this cazique?\" \"The chief of the Poyuches Indians; a man with two tongues and two\nhearts.\" [Sidenote: A SCIENTIFIC BATH.] \"That is to say, false in word and in deed,\" said Paganel, after\ntranslating to his companions this beautiful metaphor of the Indian\nlanguage. \"And can we rescue our friend?\" he added. \"Perhaps so, if your friend is still in the hands of the Indians.\" \"And when did you hear of him?\" \"A long time ago, and, since then, the sun has brought back two summers\nto the sky.\" Glenarvan's joy could not be described.

It was possible that the three\nprisoners had been separated a long time. But the substance of the\nPatagonian's information was that the Indians spoke of a European who\nhad fallen into their power. The date of his captivity, the place where\nhe must have been, everything, even to the Patagonian phrase used to\nexpress his courage, related evidently to Captain Harry Grant. Their progress was now somewhat slow and difficult; their next object\nbeing to reach and cross the river Colorado, to which at length\ntheir horses brought them.

He had been married scarcely three months, having espoused Miss Helena\nTuffnel, daughter of the great traveler, William Tuffnel, one of the\nnumerous victims to the great passion for geographical discoveries. Miss Helena did not belong to a noble family, but she was Scotch, which\nequaled all nobilities in the eyes of Lord Glenarvan. This charming\nyoung creature, high-minded and devoted, the lord of Luss had made the\ncompanion of his life. He found her one day living alone, an orphan,\nalmost without fortune, in the house of her father at Kilpatrick. He\nsaw that the poor girl would make a noble wife, and he married her. Miss Tuffnel was twenty-two, a youthful blonde, with eyes as blue as\nthe waters of the Scotch lakes on a beautiful morning in spring. Her\nlove for her husband exceeded even her gratitude. She loved him as if\nshe had been the rich heiress, and he the friendless orphan. As to\ntheir tenants and servants, they were ready to lay down their lives for\nher whom they called \"our good lady of Luss.\" [Sidenote: LIFE IN THE SCOTTISH HOME.] Lord and Lady Glenarvan lived happily at Malcolm Castle, in the midst\nof the grand and wild scenery of the Highlands, rambling in the\nshady alleys of horse-chestnuts and sycamores, along the shores of\nthe lake, where still resounded the war cries of ancient times, or\nin the depths of those uncultivated gorges in which the history of\nScotland lies written in ruins from age to age. One day they would\nwander in the forests of beeches and larches, and in the midst of the\nmasses of heather; another, they would scale the precipitous summits\nof Ben Lomond, or traverse on horseback the solitary glens, studying,\ncomprehending, and admiring this poetic country, still called \"the land\nof Rob Roy,\" and all those celebrated sites so grandly sung by Walter\nScott. In the sweet, still evening, when the \"lantern of Mac Farlane\"\nillumined the horizon, they would stroll along the \"bartizans,\" an old\ncircular balcony that formed a chain of battlements to Malcolm Castle,\nand there, pensive, oblivious, and as if alone in the world, seated\non some detached rock, under the pale rays of the moon, while night\ngradually enveloped the rugged summits of the mountains, they would\ncontinue wrapt in that pure ecstasy and inward delight known only to\nloving hearts. [Illustration]\n\nThus passed the first months of their married life. But Lord Glenarvan\ndid not forget that his wife was the daughter of a great traveler. He\nthought that Lady Helena must have in her heart all the aspirations of\nher father, and he was not mistaken. The Duncan was constructed, and\nwas designed to convey Lord and Lady Glenarvan to the most beautiful\ncountries of the world, along the waves of the Mediterranean, and to\nthe isles of the Archipelago. Imagine the joy of Lady Helena when her\nhusband placed the Duncan at her disposal! Indeed, can there be a\ngreater happiness than to lead your love towards those charming \"isles\nwhere Sappho sung,\" and behold the enchanting scenes of the Orient,\nwith all their spirit-stirring memories?", "similarity": 0.47784173488616943}, {"chunk_id": 75, "text": "He was by parentage a\nBasque, and his name was Manuel Ipharaguerre. A year after his arrival\nin the country, Sergeant Manuel was naturalized, joined the Argentine\narmy, and married an honest Indian woman, who had twins,--boys, to be\nsure, for the sergeant's worthy consort would never present him with\ndaughters. Manuel did not think of any other calling than that of the\nsoldier, and hoped, in time, with the help of God, to offer to the\nrepublic a whole battalion of young soldiers. \"You have seen them?\" said he. \"Charming fellows! Good soldiers! José! Juan! Miguel! Pepe! Pepe is only seven years old, and is already biting\nhis cartridge!\" Pepe, hearing himself complimented, joined his two little feet, and\npresented arms with perfect precision. \"He will do!\" added the sergeant. \"He will be a major--or\nbrigadier-general one day!\" This story lasted a quarter of an hour, to Thalcave's great\nastonishment. The Indian could not understand how so many words could\ncome from a single throat. No one interrupted the commander; and even\na French sergeant had to conclude at last, though not without forcing\nhis guests to accompany him to his dwelling. Here they were introduced\nto Madame Ipharaguerre, who appeared to be \"a good-looking person,\" if\nthis expression may be employed in regard to an Indian. When he had exhausted himself, the sergeant asked his guests to what he\nowed the honor of their visit. And now it was their turn to explain. Paganel, opening the conversation in French, told him of their journey\nacross the Pampas, and ended by asking why the Indians had abandoned\nthe country. \"War!\" replied the sergeant. \"War?\" \"Yes, civil war.\" \"Civil war?\" rejoined Paganel. \"Yes, war between Paraguay and Buenos Ayres,\" answered the sergeant. \"Well?\" \"Why, all the Indians of the north are in the rear of General Flores,\nand those of the plains are plundering.\" \"But the caziques?\" \"The caziques with them.\" This answer was reported to Thalcave, who shook his head. Indeed,\nhe either did not know, or had forgotten, that a civil war, which\nwas afterwards to involve Brazil, was decimating two-thirds of the\nrepublic. The Indians had everything to gain in these internal\nstruggles, and could not neglect such fine opportunities for plunder. The sergeant, therefore, was not mistaken in attributing this desertion\nof the Pampas to the civil war that was being waged in the northern\npart of the Argentine Provinces. But this event disconcerted Glenarvan's hopes. If Captain Grant was\na prisoner of the caziques, he must have been carried by them to the\nnorthern frontiers. Yet how and where to find him? Must they attempt\na perilous and almost useless search to the northern limits of the\nPampas? It was a serious matter, which was to be earnestly considered. However, one important question was still to be asked of the sergeant,\nand the major thought of this, while his companions were looking at\neach other in silence. \"Have you heard of any Europeans being retained as prisoners by the\ncaziques of the Pampas?\" Manuel reflected for a few moments, like a man who recalls events to\nrecollection. \"Yes,\" said he, at length. \"Ah!\" cried Glenarvan, conceiving a new hope. [Sidenote: REVELATIONS.] Paganel, MacNabb, Robert, and he now surrounded the sergeant. \"Speak, speak!\" cried they, gazing at him with eagerness even in their\nlooks. \"Several years ago,\" replied Manuel, \"yes,--that is it,--European\nprisoners--but have never seen them.\" \"Several years ago?\" said Glenarvan. \"You are mistaken.

CHAPTER XXVII. A NEW DESTINATION. The first moments were consecrated to the happiness of meeting. Lord Glenarvan did not wish the joy in the hearts of his friends to\nbe chilled by tidings of their want of success. His first words,\ntherefore, were,--\n\n\"Courage, my friends, courage!

Lady Helena and Mary Grant, while the boat was approaching\nthe ship, had experienced all the anguish of suspense. From the deck\nthey endeavored to count those who were returning. At one time the\nyoung girl would despair; at another she would think she saw her\nfather. Her heart beat quickly; she could not speak; she could scarcely\nstand. Lady Helena supported her, while Captain Mangles stood beside\nher in silence. His keen eyes, accustomed to distinguish distant\nobjects, could not discern the captain. \"He is there! he is coming! my father!\" murmured the young girl. But as the boat gradually drew near, the illusion vanished. Not only\nLady Helena and the captain, but Mary Grant, had now lost all hope.

Here reposed the weapons of the chief,\nhis guns loaded and primed, his lance, his splendid hatchet of green\njade, with a supply of powder and balls sufficient for the hunts of the\nother world. \"Here is a whole arsenal,\" said Paganel, \"of which we will make a\nbetter use than the deceased. It is a good idea of these savages to\ncarry their weapons to heaven with them.\" \"But these are English guns!\" said the major. \"Doubtless,\" replied Glenarvan; \"it is a very foolish custom to make\npresents of fire-arms to the savages, who then use them against the\ninvaders, and with reason. At all events, these guns will be useful to\nus.\" \"But still more useful,\" said Paganel, \"will be the provisions and\nwater intended for Kara-Tété.\" The parents and friends of the dead had, indeed, faithfully fulfilled\ntheir duties. The amount of food testified their esteem for the virtues\nof the chief. There were provisions enough to last ten persons fifteen\ndays, or rather the deceased for eternity. They consisted of ferns,\nsweet yams, and potatoes, which were introduced some time before by the\nEuropeans. Tall vases of fresh water stood near, and a dozen baskets,\nartistically woven, contained numerous tablets of green gum. The fugitives were, therefore, fortified for several days against\nhunger and thirst, and they needed no urging to take their first meal\nat the chief's expense. Glenarvan directed Mr. Olbinett's attention\nto the food necessary for his companions; but he, with his usual\nexactness, even in critical situations, thought the bill of fare rather\nscanty. Moreover, he did not know how to prepare the roots, and there\nwas no fire. But Paganel solved the difficulty, and advised him to simply bury his\nferns and potatoes in the ground itself, for the heat of the upper\nstrata was very great. Olbinett, however, narrowly escaped a serious\nscalding, for, just as he had dug a hole to put his roots in, a stream\nof watery vapor burst forth, and rose to the height of several feet.

His eccentricities (and his abilities) made him much talked of in\nScotland. People seemed as though they could not show him enough\nattention. Just at this time an amiable lady of thirty, none other than the\nmajor's cousin, a little eccentric herself, but still agreeable and\ncharming, fell in love with the geographer's peculiarities. Paganel was\nfar from being insensible to Miss Arabella's attractions, yet did not\ndare to declare his sentiments. The major accordingly undertook the\npart of Cupid's messenger between these two congenial hearts, and even\ntold Paganel that marriage was \"the last blunder\" that he could commit. But the geographer was very much embarrassed, and, strangely enough,\ncould not summon courage to speak for himself. [Illustration: Early in the afternoon the travelers reached Malcolm\nCastle, amidst the hurrahs of their tenantry and friends.] \"Does not Miss Arabella please you?\" MacNabb would say to him. \"Oh, major, she is charming!\" cried Paganel,--\"a thousand times too\ncharming for me; and, if I must tell you, would please me better if she\nwere less so. I should like to find a defect.\" \"Be easy,\" answered the major; \"she has more than one. The most perfect\nwoman always has her share. Well, then, Paganel, are you decided?\" \"I do not dare.\" \"But, my learned friend, why do you hesitate?\" \"I am unworthy of her!\" was the geographer's invariable reply. At last, one day, driven desperate by the irrepressible major, Paganel\nconfessed to him, under the pledge of secrecy, a peculiarity that would\nfacilitate his identification, if the police should ever be on his\ntrack! \"Bah!\" exclaimed the major. \"It is as I tell you,\" persisted Paganel. \"What matter, my worthy friend?\" \"Is that your opinion?\" \"On the contrary, you are only more remarkable. This adds to your\npersonal advantages. It makes you the inimitable individual of whom\nArabella has dreamed.\" And the major, preserving an imperturbable gravity, left Paganel a prey\nto the most acute anxiety. A short interview took place between MacNabb and the lady, and fifteen\nweeks after a marriage was celebrated with great pomp in the chapel of\nMalcolm Castle.

Then mud, lava, and volcanic fragments mingled in the scene of\ndevastation. Torrents of flame furrowed the sides of the Maunganamu. The adjoining mountains glowed in the light of the eruption, and the\ndeep valleys were illumined with a vivid brightness. The savages were soon aroused, both by the noise and the heat\nof the lava that flowed in a scalding tide through the midst of\ntheir encampment.

On the\nimpenetrable clay, pools, marshes, and ponds overflowed and formed\nimmense \"bañados\" of treacherous depth. Paganel, on consulting his map,\njudged rightly that the Grande and Nivarota Rivers, into which the\nwaters of the plain usually flow, must have mingled together in one\nbroad stream. An extremely rapid advance, therefore, became necessary. The common\nsafety was at stake. If the inundation increased, where could they find\na refuge?

Besides, he set the example himself. \"Laugh, my friends,\" said he, \"laugh with a will! you cannot laugh as\nmuch as I do at myself.\" And he uttered the most formidable peal of laughter that ever issued\nfrom the mouth of a geographer. \"But we are none the less without an interpreter,\" said the major. \"Oh, do not be troubled,\" replied Paganel. \"The Portuguese and Spanish\nresemble each other so much that I made a mistake. However, this very\nresemblance will soon enable me to rectify my error, and in a short\ntime I will thank this worthy Patagonian in the language he speaks so\nwell.\" Paganel was right, for he could soon exchange a few words with the\nnative. He even learned that his name was Thalcave, a word which\nsignifies in Araucanian \"the thunderer.\" This surname was doubtless\ngiven to him for his skill in the use of fire-arms. [Sidenote: BETTER PROSPECTS.] But Glenarvan was particularly rejoiced to discover that the Patagonian\nwas a guide, and, moreover, a guide of the Pampas. There was,\ntherefore, something so providential in this meeting that the success\nof the enterprise seemed already an accomplished fact, and no one any\nlonger doubted the rescue of Captain Grant. In the meantime the travelers and the Patagonian had returned to\nRobert. The latter stretched his arms towards the native, who, without\na word, placed his hand upon his head. He examined the child and felt\nhis wounded limbs. Then, smiling, he went and gathered on the banks\nof the stream a few handfuls of wild celery, with which he rubbed the\nboy's body. Under this treatment, performed with an extreme gentleness,\nthe child felt his strength revive, and it was plain that a few hours\nwould suffice to restore him. It was therefore decided that that day and the following night should\nbe passed at the encampment. Besides, two important questions remained\nto be settled--food, and means of conveyance. Provisions and mules were\nboth wanting. Fortunately Thalcave solved the difficulty. This guide, who was\naccustomed to conduct travelers along the Patagonian frontiers, and\nwas one of the most intelligent baqueanos of the country, engaged to\nfurnish Glenarvan all that his little party needed. He offered to take\nhim to a \"tolderia\" (encampment) of Indians, about four miles distant,\nwhere they would find everything necessary for the expedition. This\nproposal was made partly by gestures, partly by Spanish words which\nPaganel succeeded in understanding. It was accepted, and Glenarvan and\nhis learned friend, taking leave of their companions, reascended the\nstream under the guidance of the Patagonian. They proceeded at a good pace for an hour and a half, taking long\nstrides to keep up to the giant Thalcave. All the region was charming,\nand of a rich fertility. The grassy pastures succeeded each other,\nand could easily have fed thousands of cattle. Large ponds, united by\na winding chain of streams, gave these plains a verdant moisture.

He spoke with a lofty animation, and was\ncarried away in the rapid flight of imagination. It would have been\nas impossible to check him as to stay the Rhine at the Falls of\nSchaffhausen. \"Monsieur Jacques Paganel,\" said Lord Glenarvan, after a moment\nof silence, \"that is certainly a fine voyage, and one for which\nscience would be very grateful; but I will not further prolong your\nignorance. For the present, you must give up the pleasure of seeing\nIndia.\" \"Give it up! And why?\" \"Because you are turning your back upon the Indian peninsula.\" \"How?

He\nwas surprised to find the depth so great as it really was, this being\nthe result of the snow having melted rapidly under the first heat of\nsummer. The width likewise of this stream was so considerable that it\nwas almost impossible for their horses to swim across; but they happily\ndiscovered a sort of weir-bridge, of wattles looped and fastened\ntogether, which the Indians were in the habit of using; and by its aid\nthe little troop was enabled to pass over to the left bank, where they\nrested for the night. [Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII. A SERIOUS NECESSITY. They set out at daybreak. The horses advanced at a brisk pace among\nthe tufts of \"paja-brava,\" a kind of grass that serves the Indians\nas a shelter during the storms. At certain distances, but less and\nless frequent, pools of shallow water contributed to the growth of\nwillows and a certain plant which is found in the neighborhood of\nfresh water. Here the horses drank their fill, to fortify themselves\nfor the journey. Thalcave, who rode in advance, beat the bushes, and\nthus frightened away the \"cholinas\" (vipers), while the agile Thaouka\nbounded over all obstacles, and aided his master in clearing a passage\nfor the horses that followed. [Illustration: They set out at daybreak. The horses advanced at a brisk\npace among the tufts of \"paja-brava,\" a kind of grass that serves the\nIndians as a shelter during the storms.] Early in the afternoon, the first traces of animals were\nencountered--the bones of an innumerable drove of cattle, in whitened\nheaps. These fragments did not extend in a winding line, such as\nanimals exhausted and falling one by one would leave behind them. Thus\nno one, not even Paganel, knew how to explain this chain of skeletons\nin a space comparatively circumscribed. He therefore questioned\nThalcave, who was not at a loss for a reply. \"What is this?\" they asked, after Paganel had inquired of the Indian. \"The fire of heaven,\" replied the geographer. \"What! the lightning could not have produced such a disaster,\" said Tom\nAustin, \"and stretched five hundred head of cattle on the earth!\" But Thalcave reaffirmed it, and he was not mistaken; for the storms of\nthe Pampas are noted for their violence. At evening they stopped at an abandoned rancho, made of interlaced\nbranches plastered with mud and covered with thatch. This structure\nstood within an inclosure of half-rotten stakes which, however,\nsufficed to protect the horses during the night against the attacks of\nthe foxes. Not that they had anything to fear personally from these\nanimals, but the malicious beasts gnawed the halters, so that the\nhorses could escape. A few paces from the rancho, a hole was dug which served as a kitchen\nand contained half-cooled embers. Within, there was a bench, a bed of\nox-hide, a saucepan, a spit, and a pot for boiling maté. The maté is\na drink very much in use in South America. It is the Indian's tea,\nconsisting of a decoction of leaves dried in the fire, and is imbibed\nthrough a straw. At Paganel's request, Thalcave prepared several\ncups of this beverage, which very agreeably accompanied the ordinary\neatables, and was declared excellent. [Sidenote: A CHANGE FOR THE WORSE.] The next day they resumed their journey towards the east. About noon\na change took place in the appearance of the Pampas, which could\nnot escape eyes wearied with its monotony.", "similarity": 0.46145644783973694}, {"chunk_id": 145, "text": "[Sidenote: A TWOFOLD SURPRISE.] But at that moment a voice, harmoniously pitched, was heard.

The\nspectacles and telescope gave him a high opinion of Paganel, whom he\nattached carefully to his person, not only by his benefits, but by\nstrong flaxen ropes, especially at night. This novel situation lasted three long days. Was he well or badly\ntreated? Both, as he stated without further explanation. In short, he\nwas a prisoner, and, except for the prospect of immediate torture,\nhis condition did not seem more enviable than that of his unfortunate\nfriends. Fortunately, last night he succeeded in biting asunder his ropes and\nescaping. He had witnessed at a distance the burial of the chief,\nknew that he had been interred on the summit of Maunganamu mountain,\nand that it was tabooed in consequence. He therefore resolved to take\nrefuge there, not wishing to leave the place where his companions were\nheld captives. He succeeded in his undertaking, arrived at Kara-Tété's\ntomb, and waited in hope that Providence would in some way deliver his\nfriends. Such was Paganel's story. Did he omit designedly any circumstance\nof his stay among the natives? More than once his embarrassment led\nthem to suspect so. However that might be, he received unanimous\ncongratulations; and as the past was now known, they returned to the\npresent. Their situation was still exceedingly critical. The natives, if they\ndid not venture to climb the mountain, expected that hunger and thirst\nwould force their prisoners to surrender. It was only a matter of time,\nand the savages had great patience. Glenarvan did not disregard the\ndifficulties of his position, but waited for the favorable issue which\nProvidence seemed to promise. And first he wished to examine this improvised fortress; not to defend\nit, for an attack was not to be feared, but that he might find a way of\nescaping. The major and the captain, Robert, Paganel, and himself, took\nthe exact bearings of the mountain. They observed the direction of the\npaths, their branches and declivities. A ridge a mile in length united\nthe Maunganamu to the Wahiti range, and then declined to the plain.

The bullets of the natives on the lower\nramparts of the pah might intercept them, and form a barrier that no\none could safely cross.

The\nrope was shaken three times, and next Captain Mangles, followed by Mary\nGrant, took the same perilous course. They were successful, and joined\nLord and Lady Glenarvan. Five minutes later all the fugitives, after their fortunate escape\nfrom the hut, left this temporary retreat, and, avoiding the inhabited\nshores of the lake, made their way by narrow paths farther down the\nmountain. They advanced rapidly, seeking to avoid all points where they\nmight be seen. They did not speak, but glided like shadows through the\nbushes. Where were they going? At random, it is true, but they were\nfree. About five o'clock day began to break. Purple tints colored the lofty\nbanks of clouds. The mountain peaks emerged from the mists of the\nmorning. The orb of day would not be long in appearing, and instead of\nbeing the signal for torture, was to betray the flight of the condemned. Before this dreaded moment arrived it was important that the fugitives\nshould be beyond the reach of the savages. But they could not advance\nquickly, for the paths were steep. Lady Helena scaled the declivities,\nsupported and even carried by Glenarvan, while Mary Grant leaned upon\nthe arm of her betrothed. Robert, happy and triumphant, whose heart was\nfull of joy at his success, took the lead, followed by the two sailors. For half an hour the fugitives wandered at a venture. Paganel was not\nthere to guide them,--Paganel, the object of their fears, whose absence\ncast a dark shadow over their happiness. However, they proceeded\ntowards the east as well as possible, in the face of a magnificent\ndawn. They had soon reached an elevation of five hundred feet above\nLake Taupo, and the morning air at this altitude was keen and cold. Hills and mountains rose one above another in indistinct outlines; but\nGlenarvan only wished to conceal himself and his companions. Afterwards\nthey would see about issuing from this winding labyrinth. [Illustration: They saw, but were also seen.] At last the sun appeared and flashed his first rays into the faces of\nthe fugitives. Suddenly a terrible yelling, the concentrated union of a\nhundred voices, broke forth upon the air. It rose from the pah, whose\nexact position Glenarvan did not now know. Moreover, a thick curtain of\nmist stretched at their feet, and prevented them from distinguishing\nthe valleys below. But the fugitives could not doubt that their escape had been\ndiscovered. Could they elude the pursuit of the natives? Had they been\nperceived? Would their tracks betray them? At this moment the lower strata of vapor rose, enveloping them for an\ninstant in a moist cloud, and they discerned, three hundred feet below\nthem, the frantic crowd of savages. They saw, but were also seen. Renewed yells resounded, mingled with\nbarks; and the whole tribe, after vainly endeavoring to climb the rock,\nrushed out of the inclosure and hastened by the shortest paths in\npursuit of the prisoners, who fled in terror from their vengeance. CHAPTER LII. THE SACRED MOUNTAIN. The summit of the mountain was a hundred feet higher. It was important\nfor the fugitives to reach it, that they might conceal themselves from\nthe sight of the Maoris, on the opposite slope.

Paganel,\nexcited and scarcely finding his words, resumed these interesting\ninterrogatories, while his eyes, fixed upon the grave Indian, strove\nto anticipate his reply before it issued from his lips. Every word the\nPatagonian said he repeated in English, so that his companions heard\nthe Indian speak, as it were, in their own language. \"And this prisoner?\" inquired Paganel. \"He was a stranger,\" replied Thalcave slowly; \"a European.\" \"You have seen him?\" \"No, but he is mentioned in the accounts of the Indians.

Immediately Robert, taking Thalcave's hands, said in a sweet voice,--\n\n\"_Es mio padre!_\"\n\n\"_Suo padre!_\" replied the Patagonian, whose look brightened. He took the boy in his arms, lifted him from his horse, and gazed at\nhim with the most curious sympathy. His intelligent countenance became\nsuffused with a peaceful emotion. But Paganel had not finished his inquiries. Where was this prisoner? What was he doing? When had Thalcave heard of him? All these questions\nthronged his mind at once. He did not have to wait long for answers,\nbut learnt that the European was a slave of one of the Indian tribes\nthat scour the plains. \"But where was he last?\" asked Paganel. \"With the cazique Calfoucoura,\" answered Thalcave. \"On the line we have been following?\" \"Yes.\" \"And who is this cazique?\" \"The chief of the Poyuches Indians; a man with two tongues and two\nhearts.\" [Sidenote: A SCIENTIFIC BATH.] \"That is to say, false in word and in deed,\" said Paganel, after\ntranslating to his companions this beautiful metaphor of the Indian\nlanguage. \"And can we rescue our friend?\" he added. \"Perhaps so, if your friend is still in the hands of the Indians.\" \"And when did you hear of him?\" \"A long time ago, and, since then, the sun has brought back two summers\nto the sky.\" Glenarvan's joy could not be described. This answer coincided exactly\nwith the date of the document. But one question remained to be asked. \"You speak of a prisoner,\" said Paganel; \"but were there not three?\" \"I do not know,\" replied Thalcave. \"And you know nothing of their actual situation?\" \"Nothing.\" This last word ended the conversation. It was possible that the three\nprisoners had been separated a long time. But the substance of the\nPatagonian's information was that the Indians spoke of a European who\nhad fallen into their power. The date of his captivity, the place where\nhe must have been, everything, even to the Patagonian phrase used to\nexpress his courage, related evidently to Captain Harry Grant. Their progress was now somewhat slow and difficult; their next object\nbeing to reach and cross the river Colorado, to which at length\ntheir horses brought them.

[Sidenote: ACCESSIONS, AND PROGRESS.] The sun was just sinking below the horizon as the canoe ran upon a bank\nof pumice-stones, which the Waikato carries with it from its source\nin the volcanic mountains. Several trees grew here, as if designed to\nshelter an encampment. Kai-Koumou landed his prisoners. The men had their hands tied, the ladies were free. All were placed\nin the centre of the encampment, around which large fires formed an\nimpassable barrier. Before Kai-Koumou had informed his captives of his intention to\nexchange them, Glenarvan and Captain Mangles had discussed various\nmethods of recovering their liberty. What they could not venture in the\nboat they hoped to attempt on land, at the hour for encamping, under\ncover of the night. But since Glenarvan's conversation with the chief, it seemed wise to\nabandon this design. They must be patient. It was the most prudent\nplan. The exchange offered chances that neither an open attack nor a\nflight across these unknown regions could afford. Many circumstances\nmight indeed arise that would delay, and even prevent, such a\ntransaction; but still it was better to await the result. What,\nmoreover, could ten defenceless men do against thirty well-armed\nsavages? Besides, Glenarvan thought it likely that Kai-Koumou's tribe\nhad lost some chief of high rank whom they were particularly anxious to\nrecover; and he was not mistaken. The next day the canoe ascended the river with increased swiftness. It stopped for a moment at the junction of a small river which wound\nacross the plains on the right bank. Here another canoe, with ten\nnatives on board, joined Kai-Koumou. The warriors merely exchanged\nsalutations, and then continued their course. The new-comers had\nrecently fought against the English troops, as could be seen by their\ntattered garments, their gory weapons, and the wounds that still bled\nbeneath their rags.

How long this indescribable scene lasted, no one could tell; in what\nabyss all were to be engulfed, no one was able to foresee. Whether they\nwere all there alive, or whether one of them was lying at the bottom of\na crevasse, no one could say. Stunned by the swiftness of the descent,\nchilled by the keenness of the cold, blinded by the whirlwinds of snow,\nthey panted, exhausted and almost inanimate, and only clung to the\nrocks by the supreme instinct of preservation. All at once a shock of unusual violence arrested their gliding vehicle. They were thrown forward and rolled upon the last declivities of the\nmountains. The plateau had stopped short.

The eastern side of the Andes consists of long slopes, declining\ngradually to the plain upon which a portion of the mass had suddenly\nstopped. In this new country, garnished with rich pastures and adorned\nwith magnificent vegetation, an incalculable number of apple-trees,\nplanted at the time of the conquest, glowed with their golden fruit\nand formed true forests. It seemed as if a part of beautiful Normandy\nhad been cast into these monotonous regions, and under any other\ncircumstances the eye of a traveler would have been struck with this\nsudden transition from desert to oasis, from snowy peak to verdant\nprairie, from winter to summer. The earth had regained an absolute immobility, and the earthquake had\nceased. But without doubt the subterranean forces were still exerting\ntheir devastating action at a distance, for the chain of the Andes is\nalways agitated or trembling in some part. This time, however, the\ncommotion had been of extreme violence. The outline of the mountains\nwas entirely changed; a new view of summits, crests, and peaks was\ndefined against the azure of the sky; and the guide of the Pampas would\nhave sought in vain for his accustomed landmarks. [Sidenote: COMEDY CHANGED TO TRAGEDY.] A wonderfully beautiful day was breaking. The rays of the sun, issuing\nfrom their watery bed in the Atlantic, glittered over the Argentine\nplains and were already silvering the waves of the other ocean. It was\neight o'clock in the morning. Glenarvan and his companions, revived by the aid of the major,\ngradually recovered consciousness. Indeed, they had only undergone\na severe giddiness. The mountain was descended, and they would have\napplauded a means of locomotion which had been entirely at nature's\nexpense, if one of the feeblest, Robert Grant, had not been missing. Every one loved the courageous boy: Paganel was particularly attached\nto him; the major, too, in spite of his coldness; but especially\nGlenarvan. When the latter learned of Robert's disappearance, he was desperate. He\npictured to himself the poor child engulfed in some abyss, and calling\nvainly for him whom he considered his second father.", "similarity": 0.27502477169036865}, {"chunk_id": 197, "text": "A bed of dry fern covered the bottom. Eight oars at\nthe bow propelled it up the river, while a man at the stern guided it\nby means of a movable paddle. This man was a native, of tall form, about forty-five years old, with\nbroad breast and powerful limbs. His protruding and deeply furrowed\nbrow, his fierce look and his sinister countenance, showed him to be a\nformidable individual. He was a Maori chief of high rank, as could be seen by the delicate\nand compact tattooing that striped his face and body. Two black\nspirals, starting from the nostrils of his aquiline nose, circled his\ntawny eyes, met on his forehead, and were lost in his abundant hair. His mouth, with its shining teeth, and his chin, were hidden beneath\na net-work of varied colors, while graceful lines wound down to his\nsinewy breast. There was no doubt as to his rank. The sharp albatross bone, used\nby Maori tattooers, had furrowed his face five times, in close and\ndeep lines. That he had reached his fifth promotion was evident from\nhis haughty bearing. A large flaxen mat, ornamented with dog-skins,\nenveloped his person; while a girdle, bloody with his recent conflicts,\nencircled his waist. From his ears dangled ear-rings of green jade, and\naround his neck hung necklaces of \"pounamous,\" sacred stones to which\nthe New Zealanders attribute miraculous properties. At his side lay a\ngun of English manufacture, and a \"patou-patou,\" a kind of double-edged\nhatchet. Near him nine warriors, of lower rank, armed and of ferocious aspect,\nsome still suffering from recent wounds, stood in perfect immobility,\nenveloped in their flaxen mantles. Three dogs of wild appearance were\nstretched at their feet. The eight rowers seemed to be servants or\nslaves of the chief. They worked vigorously, and the boat ascended the\ncurrent of the Waikato with remarkable swiftness. In the centre of this long canoe, with feet tied, but hands free, were\nten European prisoners clinging closely to each other. They were Lord\nGlenarvan and his companions. [Sidenote: A TESTING TIME.] The evening before, the little party, led astray by the dense fog, had\nencamped in the midst of a numerous tribe of natives. About midnight,\nthe travelers, surprised in their sleep, were made prisoners and\ncarried on board the canoe. They had not yet been maltreated, but had\ntried in vain to resist. Their arms and ammunition were in the hands of\nthe savages, and their own bullets would have quickly stretched them on\nthe earth had they attempted to escape. They were not long in learning, by the aid of a few English words which\nthe natives used, that, being driven back by the British troops, they\nwere returning, vanquished and weakened, to the regions of the upper\nWaikato. Their chief, after an obstinate resistance, in which he lost\nhis principal warriors, was now on his way to rouse again the river\ntribes. He was called Kai-Koumou, a terrible name, which signified\nin the native language \"he who eats the limbs of his enemy.\" He was\nbrave and bold, but his cruelty equaled his bravery. No pity could be\nexpected from him. His name was well known to the English soldiers, and\na price had been set upon his head by the governor of New Zealand.

At length, however, there were various signs that they were approaching\nthe sea; by-and-by they reached the bank of a river which flows into\nthe Gulf of Carpentaria; and finally Burke and Wills, after terrible\nhardships, arrived at the point where the sea-water flowed up to and\ninundated the marshes, though the sea-shore itself they did not reach. With naught but barrenness in sight on either hand, their great desire\nwas to get back and rejoin their companions; but peril after peril\nawaited them, many of which their note-book has preserved an account\nof, but many more will be forever unrecorded. The three survivors\n(for one of the party had succumbed to the hardships) now strained\nevery effort to reach the encampment, where they hoped to find their\ncompanions and a store of provisions. On the 21st of April they\ngained the goal, but the prize was missing; only seven hours before,\nafter five months of waiting in vain, their companions had taken\ntheir departure. Of course nothing remained but to follow them with\ntheir feeble strength and scanty means of subsistence; but calamities\nstill dogged their footsteps, and at last the leader, Burke, lay down\nexhausted, saying to his companion, King, \"I have not many hours to\nlive; here are my watch and my notes; when I am dead, place a pistol\nin my right hand, and leave me without burial.\" His forebodings were\nrealized, and the next morning he died. King, in despair, went in\nsearch of some Australian tribe, for now Wills had begun to sink,\nand he shortly afterwards died also. At length the sole survivor was\nrescued by an expedition sent out in search of Burke; and thus the sad\ntale was told of this Australian tragedy.

They felt that he was seeking\nin their looks some ray of hope, and they lowered their eyes. \"Well,\" continued Glenarvan, \"you understand me; you are silent! You\nhave no more hope!\" A few moments of silence ensued, when MacNabb inquired:\n\n\"Who of you, my friends, remembers when Robert disappeared?\" To this question no answer was given. \"At least,\" continued the major, \"you can tell with whom the boy was\nduring the descent.\" \"With me,\" replied Wilson. \"Well, at what moment did you last see him with you?

Remember, Wilson, the minutes may have seemed\nlong to you. Are you not mistaken?\" \"I think not--yes, it is so, less than two minutes.\" \"Well,\" said MacNabb; \"and was Robert on your right, or on your left?\" \"On my left. I remember that his poncho flapped in my face.\" \"And where were you situated in reference to us?\" \"On the left also.\" \"Then Robert could have disappeared only on this side,\" said the major,\nturning towards the mountain, and pointing to the right. \"And also\nconsidering the time that has elapsed since his disappearance, the\nchild must have fallen at a high part of the mountain.

But it was a vain search. The child had not only\nfound death in the mountains, but also a tomb, the stone of which,\nmade of some enormous rock, was forever closed over him. Towards noon Glenarvan and his companions, bruised and exhausted, found\nthemselves again in the valley. The former was a prey to the most\nviolent grief. He scarcely spoke, and from his lips issued only these\nwords, broken by sighs,--\"I will not go; I will not go!\" Each understood this determination, and respected it. \"We will wait,\" said Paganel to the major and Tom Austin. \"Let us take\nsome rest, and recruit our strength.

As soon as he arrived at the bay, he was to\nsend a detachment of sailors under the command of Ayrton. He had just reached this part of his letter, when the major, who had\nbeen looking over his shoulder, asked him, in a singular tone, how he\nwrote the word Ayrton. \"As it is pronounced,\" replied Glenarvan. \"That is a mistake,\" said the major coolly. \"It is pronounced Ayrton,\nbut it is written 'Ben Joyce'!\" CHAPTER XLI. THE PLOT UNVEILED. The sound of the name of Ben Joyce fell upon the party like a\nthunderbolt. Ayrton suddenly sprang to his feet. In his hand was a\nrevolver. A report was heard; and Glenarvan fell, struck by a bullet. Before Captain Mangles and the sailors recovered from the surprise into\nwhich this unexpected turn of affairs had thrown them, the audacious\nconvict had escaped, and joined his band, scattered along the edge of\nthe wood of gum-trees. [Illustration: A report was heard; and Glenarvan fell, struck by a\nbullet.] The tent did not offer a sufficient shelter against the bullets, and\nit was clearly necessary to beat a retreat. Glenarvan, who was but\nslightly injured, had risen. \"To the cart! to the cart!\" cried Captain Mangles, as he hurried on\nLady Helena and Mary Grant, who were soon in safety behind its stout\nsides. The captain, the major, Paganel, and the sailors then seized their\nrifles, and stood ready to repel the convicts. Glenarvan and Robert had\njoined the ladies, while Olbinett hastened to the common defence. These events had transpired with the rapidity of lightning. Captain\nMangles attentively watched the edge of the wood; but the reports\nsuddenly ceased on the arrival of Ben Joyce, and a profound silence\nsucceeded the noisy fusillade. A few wreaths of white smoke were still\ncurling up between the branches of the gum-trees, but the tall tufts of\ngastrolobium were motionless and all signs of attack had disappeared. The major and Captain Mangles extended their examinations as far as the\ngreat trees. The place was abandoned. Numerous footprints were seen,\nand a few half-burnt cartridges smoked on the ground. The major, like\na prudent man, extinguished them, for a spark was enough to kindle a\nformidable conflagration in this forest of dry trees. \"The convicts have disappeared,\" said Captain Mangles. \"Yes,\" replied the major; \"and this disappearance alarms me.

But from the\nedge of the wood to the banks of the Snowy they did not meet with a\nsingle convict. Ben Joyce's band seemed to have flown away, like a\nflock of mischievous birds. This disappearance was too strange to\ninspire a perfect security. They therefore resolved to keep on the\nwatch. The cart, which was a really immovable fortress, became the\ncentre of the encampment, and two men kept guard, relieving each other\nevery hour.

CHAPTER XXXV. CRIME OR CALAMITY? [Sidenote: THE MISCHIEF REPAIRED.] It was not without a certain feeling of apprehension that the major\nhad seen Ayrton leave the Wimerra to procure a farrier at Black Point\nStation. However, he did not breathe a word of his personal suspicions,\nbut contented himself with exploring the surroundings of the river,\nwhose tranquillity was undisturbed. As for Glenarvan, his only fear was\nto see Ayrton return alone. In the absence of skilled labor, the cart\ncould not resume its journey, which would be interrupted for several\ndays perhaps; and his longings for success and eagerness to attain his\nend admitted of no delay. Fortunately, Ayrton had lost neither his time nor his trouble. The\nnext morning he reappeared at break of day. A man accompanied him, by\nprofession a farrier. He was a tall, stout fellow, but of a low and\nbrutish appearance, which did not prepossess one in his favor. However,\nthis was of little importance, if he knew his business. At all events\nhis breath was not wasted in idle words. \"Is he an efficient workman?\" inquired Captain Mangles of the\nquartermaster. \"I know no more than you, captain,\" replied Ayrton. \"We shall see.\" The farrier began his work. He was a man who understood his trade, as\none could see by the way in which he repaired the wheels of the cart. He labored skillfully and with uncommon energy. During the operation, the major noticed that the farrier's wrists were\nconsiderably eroded, and that they were each encircled by a blackish\nring of extravasated blood. These were the marks of recent wounds,\nwhich the sleeves of a miserable woolen shirt but partially concealed. MacNabb questioned the man about these erosions, which must have been\nvery painful. He, however, made no reply, but stolidly kept on at his\nwork. Two hours after, the injuries of the cart were repaired. As for\nGlenarvan's horse, he was quickly shod. The farrier had taken care to\nbring shoes all prepared. There was a peculiarity about them, however,\nwhich did not escape the major. It was a trefoil rudely carved on the\nouter rim. He pointed it out to Ayrton. \"It is the Black Point mark,\" replied the quartermaster, \"which enables\nthem to follow the tracks of the horses that stray from the station,\nand not confound them with others.\" The farrier, having done all that was required of him, now claimed his\nwages, and departed without having spoken four words. Half an hour later, the travelers were on the move. Beyond the curtain\nof mimosas extended a broad, uncovered space, which justly deserved its\nname of \"open plain.\" Fragments of quartz and ferruginous rocks lay\namong the bushes, tall grass, and hedgerows that protected numerous\nflocks.", "similarity": 0.398275762796402}, {"chunk_id": 229, "text": "\"Providence has decreed----\"\n\n\"No, madam, pardon me,\" returned the sailor; \"no, it is not possible!

He maintained that it was a mistake, and that you had\nappointed Twofold Bay as the place of meeting.\" \"Have you the letter, Tom?\" asked the major, greatly puzzled. \"Yes, Mr. MacNabb,\" replied Austin. \"I will soon bring it.\" He accordingly repaired to his own cabin. While he was gone, they gazed\nat each other in silence, except the major, who, with his eye fixed\nupon Paganel, said, as he folded his arms:\n\n\"Indeed, I must confess, Paganel, that this is a little too much.\" At this moment Austin returned. He held in his hand the letter written\nby Paganel, and signed by Glenarvan. \"Read it, my lord,\" said the old sailor. Glenarvan took the letter, and read:\n\n\"Order for Tom Austin to put to sea, and bring the Duncan to the\neastern coast of New Zealand.\" \"New Zealand?\" cried Paganel, starting. He snatched the letter from Glenarvan's hands, rubbed his eyes,\nadjusted his spectacles to his nose, and read in his turn. \"New Zealand!\" repeated he, in an indescribable tone, while the letter\nslipped from his fingers. Just then he felt a hand fall upon his shoulder. He turned, and found\nhimself face to face with the major. [Sidenote: PAGANEL IN THE WITNESS-BOX.] \"Well, my good Paganel,\" said MacNabb, in a grave tone, \"it is\nfortunate that you did not send the Duncan to Cochin-China.\" This sally finished the poor geographer. A fit of laughter seized the\nwhole crew. Paganel, as if mad, ran to and fro, holding his head in his\nhands, and tearing his hair. However, when he had recovered from his\nfrenzy, there was still another unavoidable question to answer. \"Now, Paganel,\" said Glenarvan, \"be candid. I acknowledge that your\nabsent-mindedness has been providential. To be sure, without you the\nDuncan would have fallen into the hands of the convicts; without you we\nshould have been recaptured by the Maoris. But do tell me, what strange\nassociation of ideas, what unnatural aberration, induced you to write\nNew Zealand instead of Australia?\" \"Very well,\" said Paganel. \"It was----\"\n\nBut at that moment his eyes fell upon Robert and Mary Grant, and he\nstopped short, finally replying:\n\n\"Never mind, my dear Glenarvan. I am a madman, a fool, an incorrigible\nbeing, and shall die a most famous blunderer!\" The affair was no longer discussed. The mystery of the Duncan's\npresence there was solved; and the travelers, so miraculously saved,\nthought only of revisiting their comfortable cabins and partaking of a\ngood breakfast. However, leaving Lady Helena, Mary Grant, the major, Paganel, and\nRobert to enter the saloon, Glenarvan and Captain Mangles retained Tom\nAustin with them. They wished to question him further. \"Now, Tom,\" said Glenarvan, \"let me know: did not this order to sail\nfor the coast of New Zealand seem strange to you?\" \"Yes, my lord,\" replied Austin. \"I was very much surprised; but, as I\nam not in the habit of discussing the orders I receive, I obeyed. Could\nI act otherwise? If any accident had happened from not following your\ninstructions, should I not have been to blame? Would you have done\ndifferently, captain?\" \"No, Tom,\" answered Captain Mangles. \"But what did you think?\" asked Glenarvan.", "similarity": 0.4205576479434967}, {"chunk_id": 151, "text": "Ayrton\nwould doubtless have been eventually nonplused had they not, after an\nhour's climbing, caught sight of a tavern on one of the paths of the\nmountain. \"Well!\" said Paganel, as they reached the hostelry, \"the proprietor of\nthis inn cannot make a great fortune in such a place. Of what use can\nhe be?\" \"To give us the information we need for our journey,\" replied\nGlenarvan. \"Let us go in.\" Glenarvan, followed by Ayrton, entered the tavern. The landlord of\n\"Bush Inn\" was a coarse man, of forbidding appearance, who had to\nconsider himself as the principal customer for the gin, brandy, and\nwhisky of his tavern, and scarcely ever saw any one but squatters or\nherdsmen. He replied in an ill-humored way to the questions that were addressed\nhim; but his answers sufficed to determine Ayrton upon his course. Glenarvan, however, remunerated the tavern-keeper for the little\ntrouble they had given him, and was about to leave the inn, when a\nplacard, affixed to the wall, attracted his attention. It was a notice\nof the colonial police, detailing the escape of the convicts from\nPerth, and setting a price upon the head of Ben Joyce--a hundred pounds\nsterling to any one who should deliver him up. \"Indeed,\" said Glenarvan, \"that is a rascal worth hanging.\" \"And especially worth taking,\" replied Ayrton. \"A hundred pounds! What\na sum! He is not worth it.\" \"As for the inn-keeper,\" added Glenarvan, as he left the room, \"I\nscarcely put faith in him, despite his placard.\" \"Nor I either,\" said Ayrton. Glenarvan and the quartermaster rejoined the party, and they all\nproceeded to where a narrow pass wound across the chain. Here they\nbegan the ascent. [Sidenote: ANOTHER DEATH.] But it was an arduous task. More than once the ladies and their\ncompanions had to dismount, and it was often necessary to push the\nwheels of the heavy vehicle at some steep ascent, or to hold it\nback along the edge of some dangerous precipice. The oxen, as they\ncould not work to advantage at sudden turns, had frequently to be\nunyoked, and the cart blocked to prevent it from sliding back. Ayrton\nwas repeatedly forced to bring the already exhausted horses to his\nassistance. Whether this exertion was too prolonged, or whether from some other\ncause, one of the horses gave out during the ascent. He fell suddenly,\nwithout an instant's warning. It was Mulready's horse; and when the\nsailor attempted to help him up, he found that he was dead. Ayrton\nexamined the animal carefully, but did not seem to understand the cause\nof this sudden death. \"The beast must have burst a blood-vessel,\" said Glenarvan. \"Evidently,\" replied Ayrton. \"Take my horse, Mulready,\" added Glenarvan; \"I will join Lady Helena in\nthe cart.\" Mulready obeyed, and the little party continued their fatiguing ascent,\nabandoning the body to the crows. The next day they began the descent, which was much more rapid. During\nits course a violent hail-storm burst on them, and they were forced to\nseek a shelter beneath the rocks. Not hailstones, but pieces of ice as\nlarge as one's hand, were precipitated from the angry clouds. A sling\ncould not have hurled them with greater force, and several sharp blows\nwarned Paganel and Robert to be on their guard. The cart was pierced\nthrough in many places: indeed, few roofs could have resisted the fall\nof these cutting missiles, some of which froze to the trunks of the\ntrees.", "similarity": 0.4226571321487427}]}

Besides, he set the example himself. \"Laugh, my friends,\" said he, \"laugh with a will! you cannot laugh as\nmuch as I do at myself.\" And he uttered the most formidable peal of laughter that ever issued\nfrom the mouth of a geographer. \"But we are none the less without an interpreter,\" said the major. \"Oh, do not be troubled,\" replied Paganel. \"The Portuguese and Spanish\nresemble each other so much that I made a mistake. However, this very\nresemblance will soon enable me to rectify my error, and in a short\ntime I will thank this worthy Patagonian in the language he speaks so\nwell.\" Paganel was right, for he could soon exchange a few words with the\nnative. He even learned that his name was Thalcave, a word which\nsignifies in Araucanian \"the thunderer.\" This surname was doubtless\ngiven to him for his skill in the use of fire-arms. [Sidenote: BETTER PROSPECTS.] But Glenarvan was particularly rejoiced to discover that the Patagonian\nwas a guide, and, moreover, a guide of the Pampas. There was,\ntherefore, something so providential in this meeting that the success\nof the enterprise seemed already an accomplished fact, and no one any\nlonger doubted the rescue of Captain Grant. In the meantime the travelers and the Patagonian had returned to\nRobert. The latter stretched his arms towards the native, who, without\na word, placed his hand upon his head. He examined the child and felt\nhis wounded limbs. Then, smiling, he went and gathered on the banks\nof the stream a few handfuls of wild celery, with which he rubbed the\nboy's body. Under this treatment, performed with an extreme gentleness,\nthe child felt his strength revive, and it was plain that a few hours\nwould suffice to restore him. It was therefore decided that that day and the following night should\nbe passed at the encampment. Besides, two important questions remained\nto be settled--food, and means of conveyance. Provisions and mules were\nboth wanting. Fortunately Thalcave solved the difficulty. This guide, who was\naccustomed to conduct travelers along the Patagonian frontiers, and\nwas one of the most intelligent baqueanos of the country, engaged to\nfurnish Glenarvan all that his little party needed. He offered to take\nhim to a \"tolderia\" (encampment) of Indians, about four miles distant,\nwhere they would find everything necessary for the expedition. This\nproposal was made partly by gestures, partly by Spanish words which\nPaganel succeeded in understanding. It was accepted, and Glenarvan and\nhis learned friend, taking leave of their companions, reascended the\nstream under the guidance of the Patagonian. They proceeded at a good pace for an hour and a half, taking long\nstrides to keep up to the giant Thalcave. All the region was charming,\nand of a rich fertility. The grassy pastures succeeded each other,\nand could easily have fed thousands of cattle. Large ponds, united by\na winding chain of streams, gave these plains a verdant moisture. Black-headed swans sported on the mirror-like surface, and disputed the\nempire of the waters with numberless ostriches that gamboled over the\nplains, while the brilliant feathered tribes were in wonderful variety.

Thus Glenarvan extended his\nhand very cordially to his unexpected guest. \"And now that our introduction is over,\" added he, \"will you permit me,\nMonsieur Paganel, to ask you a question?\" \"Twenty, my lord,\" replied Jacques Paganel; \"it will always be a\npleasure to converse with you.\" \"You arrived on board this vessel the day before yesterday?\" \"Yes, my lord, day before yesterday, at eight o'clock in the evening.

Let us not, therefore, be led astray\nby vain conjectures, but only be certain that Ayrton is Ben Joyce, a\nsailor of the Britannia, now chief of a band of convicts.\" The major's explanation was accepted as conclusive. \"Now,\" replied Glenarvan, \"will you tell me how and why Harry Grant's\nquartermaster is in Australia?\" \"How, I do not know,\" said MacNabb; \"and the police declare they know\nno more than I on the subject.

But one serious fact appeared from this explanation. No one had yet\nthought of it; only Mary Grant, disregarding the past, looked forward\nto the future. Captain Mangles first saw her pale and disconsolate. He\nunderstood what was passing in her mind. \"Miss Mary!\" cried he, \"you are weeping!\" \"What is the matter, my child?\" asked Lady Helena. \"My father, madam, my father!\" replied the young girl.

He did not,\nhowever, notice one peculiarity observed by Glenarvan, and that was the\nyoung captain's attentions to his neighbor, Mary Grant. A slight sign\nfrom Lady Helena to her husband told him how matters stood. He gazed at\nthe two young people with affectionate sympathy, and finally addressed\nthe captain, but upon a different subject. \"How did you succeed with your voyage, captain?\" he inquired. \"Excellently,\" replied the captain; \"only I must inform your lordship\nthat we did not return by way of the Strait of Magellan.\" \"What!\" cried Paganel, \"you doubled Cape Horn, and I was not there!\" \"Hang yourself!\" said the major. \"Selfish fellow! you give me this advice in order that you may share my\nrope!\" retorted the geographer. \"Well, my dear Paganel,\" added Glenarvan, \"unless we are endowed with\nubiquity, we cannot be everywhere. Since you crossed the Pampas, you\ncould not at the same time double Cape Horn.\" \"Nevertheless, I am sorry,\" replied the geographer. Captain Mangles now told the story of his voyage, and was congratulated\nby Glenarvan, who, addressing Mary Grant, said,--\n\n\"My dear young lady, I see that Captain John pays his homage to your\nnoble qualities, and I am happy to find that you are not displeased\nwith his ship.\" \"Oh, how could I be?\" replied Mary, gazing at Lady Helena, and perhaps\nalso at the young captain. \"My sister loves you, Mr. Captain,\" cried Robert, \"and I do too.\" \"And I return your love, my dear boy,\" replied Captain Mangles, a\nlittle confused by Robert's words, which also brought a slight blush to\nthe face of the young girl. Then, changing the conversation to a less embarrassing subject, the\ncaptain added,--\n\n\"Since I have related the Duncan's voyage, will not your lordship give\nus a few particulars of your travels, and the exploits of our young\nhero?\" No recital could have been more agreeable to Lady Helena and Miss\nGrant, and Glenarvan hastened to satisfy their curiosity. He told, word\nfor word, all about their journey from ocean to ocean. The passage\nof the Andes, the earthquake, Robert's disappearance, his capture by\nthe condor, Thalcave's fortunate shot, the adventure with the wolves,\nthe boy's devotion, the meeting with Sergeant Manuel, the inundation,\ntheir refuge in the tree, the lightning, the fire, the alligators,\nthe water-spout, the night on the shores of the Atlantic, all these\nincidents, cheerful or serious, excited alternately the joy and terror\nof his hearers. Many a circumstance was related that brought Robert\nthe caresses of his sister and Lady Helena.

This novel situation lasted three long days. Was he well or badly\ntreated? Both, as he stated without further explanation. In short, he\nwas a prisoner, and, except for the prospect of immediate torture,\nhis condition did not seem more enviable than that of his unfortunate\nfriends. Fortunately, last night he succeeded in biting asunder his ropes and\nescaping. He had witnessed at a distance the burial of the chief,\nknew that he had been interred on the summit of Maunganamu mountain,\nand that it was tabooed in consequence. He therefore resolved to take\nrefuge there, not wishing to leave the place where his companions were\nheld captives. He succeeded in his undertaking, arrived at Kara-Tété's\ntomb, and waited in hope that Providence would in some way deliver his\nfriends. Such was Paganel's story. Did he omit designedly any circumstance\nof his stay among the natives? More than once his embarrassment led\nthem to suspect so. However that might be, he received unanimous\ncongratulations; and as the past was now known, they returned to the\npresent. Their situation was still exceedingly critical. The natives, if they\ndid not venture to climb the mountain, expected that hunger and thirst\nwould force their prisoners to surrender. It was only a matter of time,\nand the savages had great patience. Glenarvan did not disregard the\ndifficulties of his position, but waited for the favorable issue which\nProvidence seemed to promise. And first he wished to examine this improvised fortress; not to defend\nit, for an attack was not to be feared, but that he might find a way of\nescaping. The major and the captain, Robert, Paganel, and himself, took\nthe exact bearings of the mountain. They observed the direction of the\npaths, their branches and declivities. A ridge a mile in length united\nthe Maunganamu to the Wahiti range, and then declined to the plain. Its\nnarrow and winding summit presented the only practicable route, in case\nescape should become possible. If the fugitives could pass this point\nunperceived, under cover of the night, perhaps they might succeed in\nreaching the deep valleys and outwitting the Maoris. But this course offered more than one danger, as they would have to\npass below within gun-shot. The bullets of the natives on the lower\nramparts of the pah might intercept them, and form a barrier that no\none could safely cross. Glenarvan and his friends, as soon as they ventured on the dangerous\npart of the ridge, were saluted with a volley of shots; but only a\nfew wads, borne by the wind, reached them. They were made of printed\npaper. Paganel picked them up out of curiosity, but it was difficult to\ndecipher them. [Sidenote: A STRANGE COLPORTEUR.] \"Why!\" said he, \"do you know, my friends, what these creatures use for\nwads in their guns?\" \"No,\" replied Glenarvan. \"Leaves of the Bible! If this is the use they make of the sacred\nwritings, I pity the missionaries. They will have difficulty in\nfounding Maori libraries.\" \"And what passage of the Scriptures have these natives fired at us?\" asked Glenarvan.", "similarity": 0.3401159644126892}, {"chunk_id": 180, "text": "However, he was not deterred from rehearsing how one and\nanother not merely visited, but began to settle, on the island, so that\nin the treaty of 1814 it was formally recognized as belonging to Great\nBritain, and twenty years after was important enough to have a separate\nofficial and governmental establishment. Paganel also told, at great length, the tales of many of the sad\nincidents which from time to time have marked even the commercial\nintercourse between the European and the Maori; as, for instance, the\nsad tale of conflict and bloodshed connected with the death of Captain\nMarion, a French navigator, in 1772. He had landed near the spot where\nSurville had ill-treated some of the natives and traitorously seized\na son of the chief, Takouri, who yet appeared to welcome this next\nFrench visitant, though remembering none the less the terrible duty of\nvengeance which is felt by the Maori to be so binding. [Illustration: It was on the sixth of October, 1769, that this\nnavigator (Captain Cook) first landed on the shores.] For a long time the cloak of friendship was worn by the natives, the\nmore thoroughly to lull the suspicions of the whites, and to entice a\nlarger number on shore; in which endeavor they succeeded only too well. The French ships being greatly out of repair, Marion was induced to\nfell timber at some distance in the interior, and to establish in this\noccupation a great number of his men, going frequently to them, and\nremaining with them and the apparently friendly chiefs. On one of these\noccasions the Maoris fulfilled their revengeful project with a terrible\nsatisfaction to themselves. Only one man, of all those in the interior,\nmanaged to escape, the commander himself falling a prey to their\nvengeance. They then endeavored to kill the second in command, who,\nwith several others, was nearer to the shore. These, of course, at once\nstarted for their boats; breathless, they reached them, hotly pursued\nto the water's edge by the insatiate savages. Then, safe themselves,\nthe French marksmen picked off the chief, and the previous exultation\nof the aborigines was, even in the hour of their triumph, turned to\nlamentation, coupled with wonder at the terrible power of the white\nman's fire-barrel. [Illustration: Safe themselves, the French marksmen picked off the\nchief.] All this and much more did the geographer narrate; but it must be\nconfessed that he neither spoke, nor did they listen, with the\ncomplacency evinced in his previous tales. Besides, their surroundings\nwere at the time uncomfortable, and the first prognostications of a\nspeedy passage were not likely to be verified. Unfortunately, this painful voyage was prolonged. Six days after her\ndeparture, the Macquarie had not descried the shores of Auckland. The wind was fair, however, and still blew from the southwest; but\nnevertheless the brig did not make much headway. The sea was rough, the\nrigging creaked, the ribs cracked, and the vessel rode the waves with\ndifficulty. Fortunately, Will Halley, like a man who was in no hurry, did not crowd\non sail, or his masts would inevitably have snapped. Captain Mangles\nhoped, therefore, that this clumsy craft would reach its destination\nin safety; still, he was pained to see his companions on board in such\nmiserable quarters.

No. Here are the Rio Negro, the Rio Colorado, and their\naffluents, cut by the thirty-seventh parallel, all of which might have\nserved to transport the document. There, perhaps, in the midst of a\ntribe, in the hands of settled Indians, on the shores of these unknown\nrivers, in the gorges of the sierras, those whom I have the right to\ncall our friends are awaiting an interposition of Providence.

All rose to shake hands with him. \"Yes, my father is there!\" cried Robert Grant, devouring the map with\nhis eyes. \"And wherever he is,\" replied Glenarvan, \"we shall find him, my child. Nothing is more consistent than our friend Paganel's interpretation,\nand we must follow without hesitation the course he has indicated.

In\nthe former, after ascertaining his situation, we will join the Duncan\non the eastern coast, sail to Buenos Ayres, and with a detachment,\norganized by the major, can overcome all the Indians of the Argentine\nPlains.\" \"Yes, yes, your lordship,\" answered Captain Mangles; \"and I will add\nthat this passage of the continent will be without peril.\" \"Without peril, or fatigue,\" continued Paganel. \"How many have already\naccomplished it who had scarcely our means for success, and whose\ncourage was not sustained by the grandeur of the undertaking!\" \"Sir, sir,\" exclaimed Mary Grant, in a voice broken with emotion, \"how\ncan I thank a devotion that exposes you to so many dangers?\" \"Dangers!\" cried Paganel. \"Who uttered the word _danger_?\" \"Not I!\" replied Robert Grant, with flashing eye and determined look. \"Danger!\" repeated Paganel; \"does such a thing exist? Moreover, what is\nthe question? A journey of scarcely three hundred and fifty leagues,\nsince we shall proceed in a straight line; a journey which will be\naccomplished in a favorable latitude and climate; in short, a journey\nwhose duration will be only a month at most.

A slight sign\nfrom Lady Helena to her husband told him how matters stood. He gazed at\nthe two young people with affectionate sympathy, and finally addressed\nthe captain, but upon a different subject. \"How did you succeed with your voyage, captain?\" he inquired. \"Excellently,\" replied the captain; \"only I must inform your lordship\nthat we did not return by way of the Strait of Magellan.\" \"What!\" cried Paganel, \"you doubled Cape Horn, and I was not there!\" \"Hang yourself!\" said the major. \"Selfish fellow! you give me this advice in order that you may share my\nrope!\" retorted the geographer. \"Well, my dear Paganel,\" added Glenarvan, \"unless we are endowed with\nubiquity, we cannot be everywhere. Since you crossed the Pampas, you\ncould not at the same time double Cape Horn.\" \"Nevertheless, I am sorry,\" replied the geographer. Captain Mangles now told the story of his voyage, and was congratulated\nby Glenarvan, who, addressing Mary Grant, said,--\n\n\"My dear young lady, I see that Captain John pays his homage to your\nnoble qualities, and I am happy to find that you are not displeased\nwith his ship.\" \"Oh, how could I be?\" replied Mary, gazing at Lady Helena, and perhaps\nalso at the young captain. \"My sister loves you, Mr. Captain,\" cried Robert, \"and I do too.\" \"And I return your love, my dear boy,\" replied Captain Mangles, a\nlittle confused by Robert's words, which also brought a slight blush to\nthe face of the young girl. Then, changing the conversation to a less embarrassing subject, the\ncaptain added,--\n\n\"Since I have related the Duncan's voyage, will not your lordship give\nus a few particulars of your travels, and the exploits of our young\nhero?\" No recital could have been more agreeable to Lady Helena and Miss\nGrant, and Glenarvan hastened to satisfy their curiosity. He told, word\nfor word, all about their journey from ocean to ocean. The passage\nof the Andes, the earthquake, Robert's disappearance, his capture by\nthe condor, Thalcave's fortunate shot, the adventure with the wolves,\nthe boy's devotion, the meeting with Sergeant Manuel, the inundation,\ntheir refuge in the tree, the lightning, the fire, the alligators,\nthe water-spout, the night on the shores of the Atlantic, all these\nincidents, cheerful or serious, excited alternately the joy and terror\nof his hearers. Many a circumstance was related that brought Robert\nthe caresses of his sister and Lady Helena. Never was boy more highly\npraised, or by more enthusiastic friends. \"Now, my friends,\" remarked Lord Glenarvan, when he had finished his\nrecital, \"let us think of the present. Let us return to the subject of\nCaptain Grant.\" When breakfast was over, the party repaired to Lady Helena's\nstate-room, and, taking seats around a table loaded with maps and\ncharts, resumed the conversation.", "similarity": 0.5272622108459473}, {"chunk_id": 76, "text": "\"You are mistaken.

There were two men.\" \"No, three!\" said Glenarvan. \"Two,\" replied the sergeant, in a positive tone. \"Two?\" exclaimed Glenarvan, very much chagrined. \"Two Englishmen?\" \"No,\" continued the sergeant. \"Who speaks of Englishmen? It was a\nFrenchman and an Italian.\" \"An Italian who was massacred by the Indians?\" cried Paganel. \"Yes, and I learned afterwards--Frenchman saved.\" \"Saved!\" exclaimed Robert, whose very life seemed to hang on the\nsergeant's lips. \"Yes, saved from the hands of the Indians,\" replied Manuel. Each looked to the geographer, who beat his brow in despair. \"Ah! I understand,\" said he, at last. \"All is clear, all is explained.\" \"But what is to be done?\" asked Glenarvan, with as much anxiety as\nimpatience. \"My friends,\" answered Paganel, taking Robert's hands, \"we must submit\nto a severe misfortune. We have followed a false trail! The captive\nin question is not the captain, but one of my countrymen (whose\ncompanion, Marco Vazello, was actually assassinated by the Indians),\na Frenchman who often accompanied these cruel savages to the banks of\nthe Colorado, and who, after fortunately escaping from their hands,\nreturned to France. While thinking that we were on the track of Captain\nGrant, we have fallen upon that of young Guinnard.\" A profound silence followed this declaration. The mistake was palpable. The sergeant's story, the nationality of the prisoner, the murder\nof his companion, and his escape from the hands of the Indians, all\naccorded with the evident facts. Glenarvan gazed at Thalcave with a\nbewildered air. The Indian then resumed the conversation. \"Have you never heard of three English captives?\" he asked the sergeant. \"Never,\" replied Manuel. \"It would have been known at Tandil. I should\nhave heard of it. No, it cannot be.\" Glenarvan, after this formal response, had nothing more to do at Fort\nIndependence. He and his friends, therefore, departed, not without\nthanking the sergeant and shaking hands with him. Glenarvan was in despair at this complete overthrow of his hopes. Robert walked beside him in silence, with tearful eyes, while his\nprotector could not find a single word to console him. Paganel\ngesticulated and talked to himself. The major did not open his lips. As for Thalcave, his Indian pride seemed humbled at having gone astray\non a false trail. No one, however, thought of reproaching him for so\nexcusable an error. They returned to the encampment, saddened indeed. Still, not one of\nthe courageous and devoted men regretted so many hardships uselessly\nendured, so many dangers vainly incurred. But each saw all hope of\nsuccess annihilated in an instant. Could they find Captain Grant\nbetween Tandil and the sea? No. If any prisoner had fallen into the\nhands of the Indians on the Atlantic coast, Sergeant Manuel would\ncertainly have been informed. An event of such a nature could not\nhave escaped the natives who trade from Tandil to Carmen. Among the\ntraders of the Argentine Plains everything is known and reported. There\nwas therefore but one course now to take,--to join, without delay, the\nDuncan at Cape Medano, the appointed rendezvous.

I do not know how to translate it. Perhaps the\nthird document will enable us to understand it. As to the two last\nwords, they are easily explained. _Bringt ihnen_ means _bring to them_,\nand if we compare these with the English word, which is likewise on the\nsixth line of the first document (I mean the word _assistance_), we\nshall have the phrase _bring them assistance_.\" \"Yes, bring them assistance,\" said Glenarvan. \"But where are the\nunfortunates?

Besides, he set the example himself. \"Laugh, my friends,\" said he, \"laugh with a will! you cannot laugh as\nmuch as I do at myself.\" And he uttered the most formidable peal of laughter that ever issued\nfrom the mouth of a geographer. \"But we are none the less without an interpreter,\" said the major. \"Oh, do not be troubled,\" replied Paganel. \"The Portuguese and Spanish\nresemble each other so much that I made a mistake. However, this very\nresemblance will soon enable me to rectify my error, and in a short\ntime I will thank this worthy Patagonian in the language he speaks so\nwell.\" Paganel was right, for he could soon exchange a few words with the\nnative. He even learned that his name was Thalcave, a word which\nsignifies in Araucanian \"the thunderer.\" This surname was doubtless\ngiven to him for his skill in the use of fire-arms. [Sidenote: BETTER PROSPECTS.] But Glenarvan was particularly rejoiced to discover that the Patagonian\nwas a guide, and, moreover, a guide of the Pampas. There was,\ntherefore, something so providential in this meeting that the success\nof the enterprise seemed already an accomplished fact, and no one any\nlonger doubted the rescue of Captain Grant. In the meantime the travelers and the Patagonian had returned to\nRobert. The latter stretched his arms towards the native, who, without\na word, placed his hand upon his head. He examined the child and felt\nhis wounded limbs. Then, smiling, he went and gathered on the banks\nof the stream a few handfuls of wild celery, with which he rubbed the\nboy's body. Under this treatment, performed with an extreme gentleness,\nthe child felt his strength revive, and it was plain that a few hours\nwould suffice to restore him. It was therefore decided that that day and the following night should\nbe passed at the encampment. Besides, two important questions remained\nto be settled--food, and means of conveyance. Provisions and mules were\nboth wanting. Fortunately Thalcave solved the difficulty. This guide, who was\naccustomed to conduct travelers along the Patagonian frontiers, and\nwas one of the most intelligent baqueanos of the country, engaged to\nfurnish Glenarvan all that his little party needed. He offered to take\nhim to a \"tolderia\" (encampment) of Indians, about four miles distant,\nwhere they would find everything necessary for the expedition. This\nproposal was made partly by gestures, partly by Spanish words which\nPaganel succeeded in understanding. It was accepted, and Glenarvan and\nhis learned friend, taking leave of their companions, reascended the\nstream under the guidance of the Patagonian. They proceeded at a good pace for an hour and a half, taking long\nstrides to keep up to the giant Thalcave. All the region was charming,\nand of a rich fertility. The grassy pastures succeeded each other,\nand could easily have fed thousands of cattle. Large ponds, united by\na winding chain of streams, gave these plains a verdant moisture. Black-headed swans sported on the mirror-like surface, and disputed the\nempire of the waters with numberless ostriches that gamboled over the\nplains, while the brilliant feathered tribes were in wonderful variety.

About two hundred tons of tanned hides were there,\nvery badly stowed away; but they could draw them aside without much\ndifficulty, by means of the main-stay tackling, and they at once threw\noverboard part of this ballast so as to lighten the ship. After three hours of hard labor, they could see the bottom timbers. Two\nseams in the larboard planking had sprung open as far up as the channel\nwales. As the Macquarie lay over on her starboard beams, her opposite\nside was raised, and the defective seams were out of water. Wilson\nhastened, therefore, to tighten the joints with oakum, over which he\ncarefully nailed a copper plate.

Many a circumstance was related that brought Robert\nthe caresses of his sister and Lady Helena. Never was boy more highly\npraised, or by more enthusiastic friends. \"Now, my friends,\" remarked Lord Glenarvan, when he had finished his\nrecital, \"let us think of the present. Let us return to the subject of\nCaptain Grant.\" When breakfast was over, the party repaired to Lady Helena's\nstate-room, and, taking seats around a table loaded with maps and\ncharts, resumed the conversation.", "similarity": 0.5561500787734985}, {"chunk_id": 234, "text": "Had she, then, brought this secret to light, and stirred\nthe dormant feeling of pity in the heart of this poor creature?

As soon as the quartermaster was in Lord Glenarvan's presence his\ncustodians retired. \"You desired to speak to me, Ayrton?\" said Glenarvan. \"Yes, my lord,\" replied he. \"To me alone?\" \"Yes; but I think that if Major MacNabb and Mr. Paganel were present at\nthe interview it would be better.\" \"For whom?\" \"For me.\" Ayrton spoke calmly. Glenarvan gazed at him steadily, and then sent\nword to MacNabb and Paganel, who at once obeyed his summons. \"We are ready for you,\" said Glenarvan, as soon as his two friends were\nseated at the cabin-table. Ayrton reflected for a few moments, and then said:\n\n\"My lord, it is customary for witnesses to be present at every contract\nor negotiation between two parties. That is why I requested the\npresence of Mr. Paganel and Major MacNabb; for, properly speaking, this\nis a matter of business that I am going to propose to you.\" Glenarvan, who was accustomed to Ayrton's manners, betrayed no\nsurprise, although a matter of business between this man and himself\nseemed strange. [Illustration: \"Do you agree or not?\"] [Sidenote: BARGAINING FOR TERMS.] \"What is this business?\" said he. \"This is it,\" replied Ayrton. \"You desire to know from me certain\ncircumstances which may be useful to you. I desire to obtain from you\ncertain advantages which will be valuable to me. Now, I will make an\nexchange, my lord. Do you agree or not?\" \"What are these circumstances?\" asked Paganel, quickly. \"No,\" corrected Glenarvan: \"what are these advantages?\" Ayrton bowed, showing that he understood the distinction. \"These,\" said he, \"are the advantages for which I petition. You\nstill intend, my lord, to deliver me into the hands of the English\nauthorities?\" \"Yes, Ayrton; it is only justice.\" \"I do not deny it,\" replied the quartermaster. \"You would not consent,\nthen, to set me at liberty?\" Glenarvan hesitated before answering a question so plainly asked. Perhaps the fate of Harry Grant depended upon what he was about to say. However, the feeling of duty towards humanity prevailed, and he said:\n\n\"No, Ayrton, I cannot set you at liberty.\" \"I do not ask it,\" replied the quartermaster, proudly. \"What do you wish, then?\" \"An intermediate fate, my lord, between that which you think awaits me\nand the liberty that you cannot grant me.\" \"And that is----?\" \"To abandon me on one of the desert islands of the Pacific, with the\nprincipal necessaries of life.

He doubtless thought\nof it, but probably did not like to leave his two companions alone in\nthe midst of this desert, and, that he might not outstrip them, he\nforced Thaouka to lessen his speed. It was not, however, without much\nresistance, prancing and neighing, that Thalcave's horse consented to\nkeep pace with the others. It was not so much the strength as the voice\nof his master which restrained him; the Indian actually talked to his\nhorse; and the animal, if he did not answer, at least comprehended\nhim. The Patagonian must have used excellent arguments, for, after\n\"discussing\" some time, Thaouka yielded, and obeyed his master's\ncommands. [Sidenote: GAINED AT LAST.] But, if Thaouka understood Thalcave, Thalcave had none the less\nunderstood Thaouka. The intelligent animal, through his superior\ninstincts, had perceived a moisture in the air. He inhaled it eagerly,\nand kept moving his tongue, as if it were steeped in a grateful liquid. The Patagonian could not be deceived; water was not far distant. He therefore encouraged his companions by explaining the impatience of\nhis horse, which the others were not long in understanding. They made a\nfinal effort, and galloped after the Indian. About three o'clock a bright line appeared in a hollow of the plain. It\ntrembled under the rays of the sun. \"Water!\" cried Glenarvan. \"Water, yes, water!\" cried Robert. They had no more need to urge their horses. The poor beasts, feeling\ntheir strength renewed, rushed forward with an irresistible eagerness. In a few moments they had reached the Guamini River, and, saddled as\nthey were, plunged to their breasts into the cooling stream. Their\nmasters imitated their example, without reluctance, and took an\nafternoon bath which was as healthful as it was pleasant. [Illustration]\n\n\"Ah, how good it is!\" said Robert, as he quenched his thirst in the\nmiddle of the river. \"Be moderate, my boy,\" said Glenarvan, who did not set a good example. Nothing was heard but the sound of rapid drinking. As for Thalcave,\nhe drank quietly, without hurrying, long and deeply, till they might\nperhaps fear that the stream would be drained. \"Well,\" said Glenarvan, \"our friends will not be disappointed in their\nexpectations. They are sure, on arriving at the Guamini, to find an\nabundance of clear water, if Thalcave leaves any!\" \"But could we not go to meet them?\" asked Robert. \"We could spare them\nseveral hours of anxiety.\" \"Doubtless, my boy; but how carry the water? Wilson has charge of the\nwater-bottles. No, it is better to wait, as we agreed. Calculating the\nnecessary time, and the slow pace of the horses, our friends will be\nhere at night. Let us, then, prepare them a safe shelter and a good\nrepast.\" Thalcave had not waited for Glenarvan's orders to search for a place\nto encamp. He had very fortunately found on the banks of the river a\n\"ramada,\" a kind of inclosure designed for a cattle-fold and shut in\non three sides. The situation was excellent for the purpose, so long\nas one did not fear to sleep in the open air; and that was the least\nanxiety of Thalcave's companions.

This captain, who was in duty bound to be the last on board,\nhad been the first to leave.

Command us; we are ready to obey you.\" All endorsed Glenarvan's words, and, ranged along the deck, they stood\nready for the young captain's orders. \"What is to be done?\" asked Glenarvan. John cast a glance over the ocean, looked at the shattered masts of the\nbrig, and, after a few moments' reflection, said:\n\n\"We have two ways, my lord, of extricating ourselves from this\nsituation: either to raise the vessel and put her to sea, or reach the\ncoast on a raft, which can be easily constructed.\" \"If the vessel can be raised, let us raise it,\" replied Glenarvan. \"That is the best plan, is it not?\" \"Yes, my lord; for, once ashore, what would become of us without means\nof transport?\" \"Let us avoid the coast,\" added Paganel. \"We must beware of New\nZealand.\" \"All the more so, as we have gone considerably astray,\" continued\nCaptain Mangles. \"Halley's carelessness has carried us to the south,\nthat is evident. At noon I will take an observation; and if, as I\npresume, we are below Auckland, I will try to sail the Macquarie up\nalong the coast.\" \"But the injuries of the brig?\" inquired Lady Helena. \"I do not think they are serious, madam,\" replied Captain Mangles. \"I\nshall rig a jury-mast at the bows; and we shall sail slowly, it is\ntrue, but still we shall go where we wish. If, unfortunately, the hull\nis stove in, or if the ship cannot be extricated, we must gain the\ncoast, and travel by land to Auckland.\" \"Let us examine the state of the vessel, then,\" said the major. \"This\nis of the first importance.\" Glenarvan, the captain, and Mulready opened the main scuttle, and went\ndown into the hold. About two hundred tons of tanned hides were there,\nvery badly stowed away; but they could draw them aside without much\ndifficulty, by means of the main-stay tackling, and they at once threw\noverboard part of this ballast so as to lighten the ship. After three hours of hard labor, they could see the bottom timbers. Two\nseams in the larboard planking had sprung open as far up as the channel\nwales. As the Macquarie lay over on her starboard beams, her opposite\nside was raised, and the defective seams were out of water. Wilson\nhastened, therefore, to tighten the joints with oakum, over which he\ncarefully nailed a copper plate. On sounding they found less than two\nfeet of water in the hold, which the pumps could easily exhaust, and\nthus relieve the ship.

I have some knowledge of the country, and of\nthe customs of the natives; and, if I can be of use to you----\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" replied Glenarvan. \"I think, like you,\" continued Ayrton, \"that Captain Grant and his two\nsailors were saved from the shipwreck; but, since they have not reached\nthe English possessions, since they have not reappeared, I doubt not\nthat their fate was the same as my own, and that they are prisoners of\nthe natives.\" \"You repeat, Mr. Ayrton, the arguments that I have already\nsubstantiated,\" said Paganel. \"The shipwrecked seamen are evidently\nprisoners of the natives, as they feared. But ought we to suppose that,\nlike you, they have been carried to the north?\" \"It is quite likely, sir,\" replied Ayrton. \"The hostile tribes would\nhardly remain in the neighborhood of the English provinces.\" \"This fact will complicate our search,\" said Glenarvan, quite\ndisconcerted. \"How shall we find the traces of the prisoners in the\ninterior of so vast a continent?\" A prolonged silence followed this remark. Lady Helena frequently\ncast a questioning glance at her companions, but without eliciting a\nresponsive sign. Paganel himself was silent, contrary to his custom. His usual ingenuity now failed him.

One\nof the flanges of the screw is bent, and this work can be done only at\nMelbourne.\" \"Can you not sail?\" asked the quartermaster. \"Yes; but, if the wind is contrary, it would take considerable time\nto reach Twofold Bay, and at any rate we should have to return to\nMelbourne.\" \"Well, let the yacht go to Melbourne,\" said Paganel, \"and we will go\nwithout her to Twofold Bay.\" \"But how?\" \"By crossing Australia, as we crossed South America.\" \"But the Duncan?\" added Ayrton, with singular persistency. \"The Duncan will join us, or we will join her, according to\ncircumstances.

His intentions had been clearly proved,\nand required, on the part of Glenarvan, extreme vigilance. Fortunately,\nthere was less to fear from the detected bandit than the secret traitor. But one serious fact appeared from this explanation. No one had yet\nthought of it; only Mary Grant, disregarding the past, looked forward\nto the future. Captain Mangles first saw her pale and disconsolate. He\nunderstood what was passing in her mind. \"Miss Mary!\" cried he, \"you are weeping!\" \"What is the matter, my child?\" asked Lady Helena. \"My father, madam, my father!\" replied the young girl.

Then a conversation ensued. \"I have the letter,\" said one of them. \"Give it to me,\" replied Ben Joyce; \"and now the Duncan is ours!\" At this point in the story Glenarvan could not restrain a cry. MacNabb continued:\n\n[Sidenote: A HOPELESS CHANCE.] \"'Now, you others,' said Ben Joyce, 'catch the horse. In two days I\nshall be on board the Duncan, and in six at Twofold Bay.

Mulready, although severely wounded, had strength to drag\nhimself within two hundred paces of the encampment, where we picked him\nup almost dead. This,\" added MacNabb, \"is Mulready's sad story.

Before Captain Mangles and the sailors recovered from the surprise into\nwhich this unexpected turn of affairs had thrown them, the audacious\nconvict had escaped, and joined his band, scattered along the edge of\nthe wood of gum-trees.

It is enough to know that\nI became chief of the runaways, under the name of Ben Joyce. In the\nmonth of September, 1864, I made my appearance at the Irishman's farm,\nand was received as a servant under my true name of Ayrton. Here I\nwaited till an opportunity should be offered to gain possession of a\nvessel. This was my great object. Two months later the Duncan arrived. During your visit at the farm you related, my lord, the whole story of\nCaptain Grant. I then learned what I had not known, the Britannia's\nstoppage at Callao, the last news of her, dated June, 1862, two months\nafter my abandonment, the finding of the document, the shipwreck of the\nvessel, and finally the important reasons you had for seeking Captain\nGrant in Australia. I did not hesitate, but resolved to appropriate\nthe Duncan,--a marvelous ship, that would have distanced the best of\nthe British navy. However, there were serious injuries to be repaired. I therefore let her start for Melbourne, and offered myself to you in\nmy real character of quartermaster, volunteering to guide you to the\nscene of the shipwreck, which I falsely located on the eastern coast\nof Australia. Thus followed at a distance and sometimes preceded by\nmy band of convicts, I conducted your party across the province of\nVictoria. My companions committed a useless crime at Camden Bridge,\nsince the Duncan, once at Twofold Bay, could not have escaped me, and\nwith it I should have been master of the ocean. I brought you thus\nunsuspectingly as far as the Snowy River. The horses and oxen fell dead\none by one, poisoned by the gastrolobium. I entangled the cart in the\nmarshes. At my suggestion----but you know the rest, my lord, and can\nbe certain that, except for Mr. Paganel's absent-mindedness, I should\nnow be commander on board the Duncan. Such is my story, gentlemen. My\ndisclosures, unfortunately, cannot set you on the track of Captain\nGrant, and you see that in dealing with me you have made a bad bargain.\" The quartermaster ceased, crossed his arms, according to his custom,\nand waited.

The landlord of\n\"Bush Inn\" was a coarse man, of forbidding appearance, who had to\nconsider himself as the principal customer for the gin, brandy, and\nwhisky of his tavern, and scarcely ever saw any one but squatters or\nherdsmen. He replied in an ill-humored way to the questions that were addressed\nhim; but his answers sufficed to determine Ayrton upon his course. Glenarvan, however, remunerated the tavern-keeper for the little\ntrouble they had given him, and was about to leave the inn, when a\nplacard, affixed to the wall, attracted his attention. It was a notice\nof the colonial police, detailing the escape of the convicts from\nPerth, and setting a price upon the head of Ben Joyce--a hundred pounds\nsterling to any one who should deliver him up. \"Indeed,\" said Glenarvan, \"that is a rascal worth hanging.\" \"And especially worth taking,\" replied Ayrton. \"A hundred pounds!

More than once the ladies and their\ncompanions had to dismount, and it was often necessary to push the\nwheels of the heavy vehicle at some steep ascent, or to hold it\nback along the edge of some dangerous precipice. The oxen, as they\ncould not work to advantage at sudden turns, had frequently to be\nunyoked, and the cart blocked to prevent it from sliding back. Ayrton\nwas repeatedly forced to bring the already exhausted horses to his\nassistance. Whether this exertion was too prolonged, or whether from some other\ncause, one of the horses gave out during the ascent. He fell suddenly,\nwithout an instant's warning. It was Mulready's horse; and when the\nsailor attempted to help him up, he found that he was dead. Ayrton\nexamined the animal carefully, but did not seem to understand the cause\nof this sudden death. \"The beast must have burst a blood-vessel,\" said Glenarvan. \"Evidently,\" replied Ayrton. \"Take my horse, Mulready,\" added Glenarvan; \"I will join Lady Helena in\nthe cart.\" Mulready obeyed, and the little party continued their fatiguing ascent,\nabandoning the body to the crows. The next day they began the descent, which was much more rapid. During\nits course a violent hail-storm burst on them, and they were forced to\nseek a shelter beneath the rocks. Not hailstones, but pieces of ice as\nlarge as one's hand, were precipitated from the angry clouds. A sling\ncould not have hurled them with greater force, and several sharp blows\nwarned Paganel and Robert to be on their guard.

I only conformed to the instructions contained in your\nletter.\" \"My letter?\" exclaimed Glenarvan. The ten travelers at once surrounded Tom Austin, and gazed at him in\neager curiosity. The letter written at the Snowy River had reached the\nDuncan. \"Well,\" continued Glenarvan, \"let us have an explanation; for I almost\nthink I am dreaming. You received a letter, Tom?\" \"Yes; a letter from your lordship.\" \"At Melbourne?\" \"At Melbourne; just as I had finished the repair of the ship.\" \"And this letter?\" \"It was not written by you; but it was signed by you, my lord.\" \"Exactly; it was sent by a convict, Ben Joyce.\" \"No; by the sailor called Ayrton, quartermaster of the Britannia.\" \"Yes, Ayrton or Ben Joyce; it is the same person.

Fortunately, Ayrton had lost neither his time nor his trouble. The\nnext morning he reappeared at break of day. A man accompanied him, by\nprofession a farrier. He was a tall, stout fellow, but of a low and\nbrutish appearance, which did not prepossess one in his favor. However,\nthis was of little importance, if he knew his business. At all events\nhis breath was not wasted in idle words. \"Is he an efficient workman?\" inquired Captain Mangles of the\nquartermaster. \"I know no more than you, captain,\" replied Ayrton. \"We shall see.\" The farrier began his work. He was a man who understood his trade, as\none could see by the way in which he repaired the wheels of the cart. He labored skillfully and with uncommon energy. During the operation, the major noticed that the farrier's wrists were\nconsiderably eroded, and that they were each encircled by a blackish\nring of extravasated blood. These were the marks of recent wounds,\nwhich the sleeves of a miserable woolen shirt but partially concealed. MacNabb questioned the man about these erosions, which must have been\nvery painful. He, however, made no reply, but stolidly kept on at his\nwork. Two hours after, the injuries of the cart were repaired. As for\nGlenarvan's horse, he was quickly shod. The farrier had taken care to\nbring shoes all prepared. There was a peculiarity about them, however,\nwhich did not escape the major. It was a trefoil rudely carved on the\nouter rim. He pointed it out to Ayrton. \"It is the Black Point mark,\" replied the quartermaster, \"which enables\nthem to follow the tracks of the horses that stray from the station,\nand not confound them with others.\" The farrier, having done all that was required of him, now claimed his\nwages, and departed without having spoken four words. Half an hour later, the travelers were on the move.

But this course offered more than one danger, as they would have to\npass below within gun-shot. The bullets of the natives on the lower\nramparts of the pah might intercept them, and form a barrier that no\none could safely cross. Glenarvan and his friends, as soon as they ventured on the dangerous\npart of the ridge, were saluted with a volley of shots; but only a\nfew wads, borne by the wind, reached them.

A year after his arrival\nin the country, Sergeant Manuel was naturalized, joined the Argentine\narmy, and married an honest Indian woman, who had twins,--boys, to be\nsure, for the sergeant's worthy consort would never present him with\ndaughters. Manuel did not think of any other calling than that of the\nsoldier, and hoped, in time, with the help of God, to offer to the\nrepublic a whole battalion of young soldiers. \"You have seen them?\" said he. \"Charming fellows! Good soldiers! José! Juan! Miguel! Pepe! Pepe is only seven years old, and is already biting\nhis cartridge!\" Pepe, hearing himself complimented, joined his two little feet, and\npresented arms with perfect precision. \"He will do!\" added the sergeant. \"He will be a major--or\nbrigadier-general one day!\" This story lasted a quarter of an hour, to Thalcave's great\nastonishment. The Indian could not understand how so many words could\ncome from a single throat. No one interrupted the commander; and even\na French sergeant had to conclude at last, though not without forcing\nhis guests to accompany him to his dwelling. Here they were introduced\nto Madame Ipharaguerre, who appeared to be \"a good-looking person,\" if\nthis expression may be employed in regard to an Indian. When he had exhausted himself, the sergeant asked his guests to what he\nowed the honor of their visit. And now it was their turn to explain. Paganel, opening the conversation in French, told him of their journey\nacross the Pampas, and ended by asking why the Indians had abandoned\nthe country. \"War!\" replied the sergeant. \"War?\" \"Yes, civil war.\" \"Civil war?\" rejoined Paganel. \"Yes, war between Paraguay and Buenos Ayres,\" answered the sergeant. \"Well?\" \"Why, all the Indians of the north are in the rear of General Flores,\nand those of the plains are plundering.\" \"But the caziques?\" \"The caziques with them.\" This answer was reported to Thalcave, who shook his head. Indeed,\nhe either did not know, or had forgotten, that a civil war, which\nwas afterwards to involve Brazil, was decimating two-thirds of the\nrepublic. The Indians had everything to gain in these internal\nstruggles, and could not neglect such fine opportunities for plunder. The sergeant, therefore, was not mistaken in attributing this desertion\nof the Pampas to the civil war that was being waged in the northern\npart of the Argentine Provinces. But this event disconcerted Glenarvan's hopes. If Captain Grant was\na prisoner of the caziques, he must have been carried by them to the\nnorthern frontiers. Yet how and where to find him? Must they attempt\na perilous and almost useless search to the northern limits of the\nPampas? It was a serious matter, which was to be earnestly considered. However, one important question was still to be asked of the sergeant,\nand the major thought of this, while his companions were looking at\neach other in silence. \"Have you heard of any Europeans being retained as prisoners by the\ncaziques of the Pampas?\" Manuel reflected for a few moments, like a man who recalls events to\nrecollection. \"Yes,\" said he, at length. \"Ah!\" cried Glenarvan, conceiving a new hope. [Sidenote: REVELATIONS.] Paganel, MacNabb, Robert, and he now surrounded the sergeant. \"Speak, speak!\" cried they, gazing at him with eagerness even in their\nlooks. \"Several years ago,\" replied Manuel, \"yes,--that is it,--European\nprisoners--but have never seen them.\" \"Several years ago?\" said Glenarvan. \"You are mistaken.

We cannot abandon him thus! Every valley,\nevery precipice, every abyss must be explored to the very bottom! You\nshall tie a rope around me and let me down! I will do it, you hear me,\nI will! May Heaven grant that Robert is still living! Without him,\nhow could we dare find his father? What right have we to save Captain\nGrant, if his rescue costs the life of his child?\" His companions listened without speaking. They felt that he was seeking\nin their looks some ray of hope, and they lowered their eyes. \"Well,\" continued Glenarvan, \"you understand me; you are silent! You\nhave no more hope!\" A few moments of silence ensued, when MacNabb inquired:\n\n\"Who of you, my friends, remembers when Robert disappeared?\" To this question no answer was given. \"At least,\" continued the major, \"you can tell with whom the boy was\nduring the descent.\" \"With me,\" replied Wilson. \"Well, at what moment did you last see him with you? Recall the\ncircumstances. Speak.\" \"This is all that I remember.

Are you not mistaken?\" \"I think not--yes, it is so, less than two minutes.\" \"Well,\" said MacNabb; \"and was Robert on your right, or on your left?\" \"On my left. I remember that his poncho flapped in my face.\" \"And where were you situated in reference to us?\" \"On the left also.\" \"Then Robert could have disappeared only on this side,\" said the major,\nturning towards the mountain, and pointing to the right. \"And also\nconsidering the time that has elapsed since his disappearance, the\nchild must have fallen at a high part of the mountain. There we must\nsearch, and, by taking different ways, we shall find him.\" Not a word more was said. The six men, scaling the declivities of the\nmountain, stationed themselves at different heights along the ridge,\nand began their search. They kept always to the right of their line of\ndescent, sounding the smallest fissures, descending to the bottom of\nprecipices half filled with fragments of the mass; and more than one\ncame forth with his garments in shreds, his feet and hands lacerated,\nat the peril of his life. [Sidenote: A SLEEPLESS NIGHT.] All this portion of the Andes, except a few inaccessible plateaus,\nwas carefully explored for many hours without one of these brave men\nthinking of rest. But it was a vain search. The child had not only\nfound death in the mountains, but also a tomb, the stone of which,\nmade of some enormous rock, was forever closed over him. Towards noon Glenarvan and his companions, bruised and exhausted, found\nthemselves again in the valley. The former was a prey to the most\nviolent grief. He scarcely spoke, and from his lips issued only these\nwords, broken by sighs,--\"I will not go; I will not go!\" Each understood this determination, and respected it. \"We will wait,\" said Paganel to the major and Tom Austin. \"Let us take\nsome rest, and recruit our strength. We shall need it, whether to begin\nour search or continue our journey.\" \"Yes,\" replied MacNabb, \"let us remain, since Edward wishes it.

The abandoned\nman could therefore employ his time to advantage. Nothing was wanting,\nnot even books, foremost among which was a Bible. The hour for separation had come.

Eleven days after leaving Tabor Island the Duncan came in sight of the\nAustralian coast, and anchored in Talcahuana Bay. Five months had elapsed\nsince her departure from this port, during which time the travelers\nhad made the circuit of the world on this thirty-seventh parallel. Their efforts had not been in vain, for they had found the shipwrecked\nsurvivors of the Britannia. The Duncan, having taken in her necessary stores, skirted the coasts\nof Patagonia, doubled Cape Horn, and steamed across the Atlantic. The\nvoyage was very uneventful. The yacht carried a full complement of\nhappy people; there seemed to be no secrets on board. A mystery, however, still perplexed MacNabb. Why did Paganel always\nkeep hermetically incased in his clothes, and wear a comforter over\nhis ears? The major longed to know the motive for this singular fancy. But in spite of his questions, hints, and suspicions, Paganel did not\nunbutton his coat. At last, fifty-three days after leaving Talcahuana, Captain Mangles\ndescried the lighthouse of Cape Clear. The vessel entered St. George's\nChannel, crossed the Irish Sea, and passed into the Frith of Clyde. At\neleven o'clock they anchored at Dumbarton, and early in the afternoon\nthe travelers reached Malcolm Castle, amidst the hurrahs of their\ntenantry and friends. Thus it was that Harry Grant and his two companions were rescued, and\nthat John Mangles married Mary Grant in the old cathedral of St. Mungo,\nwhere the Rev. Mr. Morton, who nine months before had prayed for the\nrescue of the father, now blessed the union of the daughter with one\nof his deliverers.

Had a new calamity happened? Had the unfortunate Paganel fallen? Already Wilson and Mulready were hastening to his assistance, when a\nlong body appeared. Paganel dangled from branch to branch. His hands\ncould grasp nothing. Was he alive, or dead? They did not know; but\nhe was about to fall into the roaring waters, when the major, with a\nstrong hand, arrested his progress. \"Very much obliged, MacNabb!\" cried Paganel. \"Why, what is the matter with you?\" said the major.

PAGANEL'S DISCLOSURE. A profound astonishment greeted these unexpected words. What did the\ngeographer mean? Had he lost his senses? He spoke, however, with\nsuch conviction that all eyes were turned towards Glenarvan. This\ndeclaration of Paganel was a direct answer to the question the former\nhad asked. But Glenarvan confined himself to a negative gesture,\nindicating disbelief in the geographer, who, as soon as he was master\nof his emotion, resumed. \"Yes,\" said he, in a tone of conviction, \"yes, we have gone astray in\nour search, and have read in the document what is not written there.\" \"Explain yourself, Paganel,\" said the major; \"and more calmly.\" [Sidenote: A NEW IDEA.] \"That is very simple, major. Like you, I was in error; like you, I\nstruck upon a false interpretation. When, but a moment ago, at the top\nof this tree, in answer to the question, at the word 'Australia' an\nidea flashed through my mind, and all was clear.\" \"What!\" cried Glenarvan, \"do you pretend that Captain Grant----\"\n\n\"I pretend,\" replied Paganel, \"that the word _Austral_ in the document\nis not complete, as we have hitherto supposed, but the root of the word\n_Australia_.\" \"This is something singular,\" said the major. \"Singular!\" replied Glenarvan, shrugging his shoulders; \"it is simply\nimpossible!\" \"Impossible,\" continued Paganel, \"is a word that we do not allow in\nFrance.\" \"What!\" added Glenarvan, in a tone of the greatest incredulity, \"do you\npretend, with that document in your possession, that the shipwreck of\nthe Britannia took place on the shores of Australia?\" \"I am sure of it!\" replied Paganel.", "similarity": 0.4082448482513428}, {"chunk_id": 57, "text": "\"Perhaps,\" replied the Patagonian. As soon as this word was translated, Thalcave was surrounded by the\nseven travelers, who gazed at him with questioning looks. Paganel,\nexcited and scarcely finding his words, resumed these interesting\ninterrogatories, while his eyes, fixed upon the grave Indian, strove\nto anticipate his reply before it issued from his lips. Every word the\nPatagonian said he repeated in English, so that his companions heard\nthe Indian speak, as it were, in their own language. \"And this prisoner?\" inquired Paganel. \"He was a stranger,\" replied Thalcave slowly; \"a European.\" \"You have seen him?\" \"No, but he is mentioned in the accounts of the Indians. He was a brave\nman.\" \"You understand, my friends,\" said Paganel; \"a courageous man!\" \"My father!\" cried Robert Grant. Then, addressing Paganel:\n\n\"How do you say 'It is my father,' in Spanish?\" he asked. \"_Es mio padre_,\" answered the geographer. Immediately Robert, taking Thalcave's hands, said in a sweet voice,--\n\n\"_Es mio padre!_\"\n\n\"_Suo padre!_\" replied the Patagonian, whose look brightened. He took the boy in his arms, lifted him from his horse, and gazed at\nhim with the most curious sympathy. His intelligent countenance became\nsuffused with a peaceful emotion. But Paganel had not finished his inquiries. Where was this prisoner? What was he doing? When had Thalcave heard of him? All these questions\nthronged his mind at once. He did not have to wait long for answers,\nbut learnt that the European was a slave of one of the Indian tribes\nthat scour the plains. \"But where was he last?\" asked Paganel. \"With the cazique Calfoucoura,\" answered Thalcave. \"On the line we have been following?\" \"Yes.\" \"And who is this cazique?\" \"The chief of the Poyuches Indians; a man with two tongues and two\nhearts.\" [Sidenote: A SCIENTIFIC BATH.] \"That is to say, false in word and in deed,\" said Paganel, after\ntranslating to his companions this beautiful metaphor of the Indian\nlanguage. \"And can we rescue our friend?\" he added. \"Perhaps so, if your friend is still in the hands of the Indians.\" \"And when did you hear of him?\" \"A long time ago, and, since then, the sun has brought back two summers\nto the sky.\" Glenarvan's joy could not be described. This answer coincided exactly\nwith the date of the document. But one question remained to be asked. \"You speak of a prisoner,\" said Paganel; \"but were there not three?\" \"I do not know,\" replied Thalcave. \"And you know nothing of their actual situation?\" \"Nothing.\" This last word ended the conversation. It was possible that the three\nprisoners had been separated a long time. But the substance of the\nPatagonian's information was that the Indians spoke of a European who\nhad fallen into their power. The date of his captivity, the place where\nhe must have been, everything, even to the Patagonian phrase used to\nexpress his courage, related evidently to Captain Harry Grant. Their progress was now somewhat slow and difficult; their next object\nbeing to reach and cross the river Colorado, to which at length\ntheir horses brought them. Here Paganel's first care was to bathe\n\"geographically\" in its waters, which are colored by a reddish clay.

A year after his arrival\nin the country, Sergeant Manuel was naturalized, joined the Argentine\narmy, and married an honest Indian woman, who had twins,--boys, to be\nsure, for the sergeant's worthy consort would never present him with\ndaughters. Manuel did not think of any other calling than that of the\nsoldier, and hoped, in time, with the help of God, to offer to the\nrepublic a whole battalion of young soldiers. \"You have seen them?\" said he. \"Charming fellows! Good soldiers! José! Juan! Miguel! Pepe! Pepe is only seven years old, and is already biting\nhis cartridge!\" Pepe, hearing himself complimented, joined his two little feet, and\npresented arms with perfect precision. \"He will do!\" added the sergeant. \"He will be a major--or\nbrigadier-general one day!\" This story lasted a quarter of an hour, to Thalcave's great\nastonishment. The Indian could not understand how so many words could\ncome from a single throat. No one interrupted the commander; and even\na French sergeant had to conclude at last, though not without forcing\nhis guests to accompany him to his dwelling. Here they were introduced\nto Madame Ipharaguerre, who appeared to be \"a good-looking person,\" if\nthis expression may be employed in regard to an Indian. When he had exhausted himself, the sergeant asked his guests to what he\nowed the honor of their visit. And now it was their turn to explain. Paganel, opening the conversation in French, told him of their journey\nacross the Pampas, and ended by asking why the Indians had abandoned\nthe country. \"War!\" replied the sergeant. \"War?\" \"Yes, civil war.\" \"Civil war?\" rejoined Paganel. \"Yes, war between Paraguay and Buenos Ayres,\" answered the sergeant. \"Well?\" \"Why, all the Indians of the north are in the rear of General Flores,\nand those of the plains are plundering.\" \"But the caziques?\" \"The caziques with them.\" This answer was reported to Thalcave, who shook his head. Indeed,\nhe either did not know, or had forgotten, that a civil war, which\nwas afterwards to involve Brazil, was decimating two-thirds of the\nrepublic. The Indians had everything to gain in these internal\nstruggles, and could not neglect such fine opportunities for plunder. The sergeant, therefore, was not mistaken in attributing this desertion\nof the Pampas to the civil war that was being waged in the northern\npart of the Argentine Provinces. But this event disconcerted Glenarvan's hopes. If Captain Grant was\na prisoner of the caziques, he must have been carried by them to the\nnorthern frontiers. Yet how and where to find him? Must they attempt\na perilous and almost useless search to the northern limits of the\nPampas? It was a serious matter, which was to be earnestly considered. However, one important question was still to be asked of the sergeant,\nand the major thought of this, while his companions were looking at\neach other in silence. \"Have you heard of any Europeans being retained as prisoners by the\ncaziques of the Pampas?\" Manuel reflected for a few moments, like a man who recalls events to\nrecollection. \"Yes,\" said he, at length. \"Ah!\" cried Glenarvan, conceiving a new hope. [Sidenote: REVELATIONS.] Paganel, MacNabb, Robert, and he now surrounded the sergeant. \"Speak, speak!\" cried they, gazing at him with eagerness even in their\nlooks. \"Several years ago,\" replied Manuel, \"yes,--that is it,--European\nprisoners--but have never seen them.\" \"Several years ago?\" said Glenarvan. \"You are mistaken.

Paganel also told, at great length, the tales of many of the sad\nincidents which from time to time have marked even the commercial\nintercourse between the European and the Maori; as, for instance, the\nsad tale of conflict and bloodshed connected with the death of Captain\nMarion, a French navigator, in 1772. He had landed near the spot where\nSurville had ill-treated some of the natives and traitorously seized\na son of the chief, Takouri, who yet appeared to welcome this next\nFrench visitant, though remembering none the less the terrible duty of\nvengeance which is felt by the Maori to be so binding. [Illustration: It was on the sixth of October, 1769, that this\nnavigator (Captain Cook) first landed on the shores.] For a long time the cloak of friendship was worn by the natives, the\nmore thoroughly to lull the suspicions of the whites, and to entice a\nlarger number on shore; in which endeavor they succeeded only too well. The French ships being greatly out of repair, Marion was induced to\nfell timber at some distance in the interior, and to establish in this\noccupation a great number of his men, going frequently to them, and\nremaining with them and the apparently friendly chiefs. On one of these\noccasions the Maoris fulfilled their revengeful project with a terrible\nsatisfaction to themselves. Only one man, of all those in the interior,\nmanaged to escape, the commander himself falling a prey to their\nvengeance. They then endeavored to kill the second in command, who,\nwith several others, was nearer to the shore. These, of course, at once\nstarted for their boats; breathless, they reached them, hotly pursued\nto the water's edge by the insatiate savages. Then, safe themselves,\nthe French marksmen picked off the chief, and the previous exultation\nof the aborigines was, even in the hour of their triumph, turned to\nlamentation, coupled with wonder at the terrible power of the white\nman's fire-barrel.

Six days after her\ndeparture, the Macquarie had not descried the shores of Auckland. The wind was fair, however, and still blew from the southwest; but\nnevertheless the brig did not make much headway. The sea was rough, the\nrigging creaked, the ribs cracked, and the vessel rode the waves with\ndifficulty. Fortunately, Will Halley, like a man who was in no hurry, did not crowd\non sail, or his masts would inevitably have snapped. Captain Mangles\nhoped, therefore, that this clumsy craft would reach its destination\nin safety; still, he was pained to see his companions on board in such\nmiserable quarters.

Each sought to explain the catastrophe, while laboring to save what was\nleft. \"The bridge has broken,\" said one.

This supposition seemed plausible, for one\nhalf of the bridge lay beneath the fragments of the cars, while the\nother still hung intact in its chains. Doubt was no longer possible;\nsurely carelessness must have caused the calamity. The accident had happened to the night express, which left Melbourne\nat forty-five minutes past eleven.

The squatters had come to their\naid, and exerted themselves to extinguish the fire, which consumed the\nheap of ruins with unconquerable fierceness.

Glenarvan turned to Mr. Mitchell, the surveyor-general, with a\nquestioning look. \"That is correct,\" said the latter; \"our examination has convinced us\nthat the catastrophe is the result of a crime.

Marseilles is filled with half-pay officers, who are daily, under one\nfrivolous pretext or other, getting up quarrels with the royalists;\nfrom hence arise continual and fatal duels among the higher classes of\npersons, and assassinations in the lower.”\n\n“You have heard, perhaps,” said the Comte de Salvieux, one of M. de\nSaint-Méran’s oldest friends, and chamberlain to the Comte d’Artois,\n“that the Holy Alliance purpose removing him from thence?”\n\n“Yes; they were talking about it when we left Paris,” said M. de\nSaint-Méran; “and where is it decided to transfer him?”\n\n“To Saint Helena.”\n\n“For heaven’s sake, where is that?” asked the marquise. “An island situated on the other side of the equator, at least two\nthousand leagues from here,” replied the count. “So much the better.

I am stricken by fate. It is horrible, indeed, but no one\nassassinates.”\n\nThe eyes of Noirtier lighted up with rage, and d’Avrigny prepared to\nspeak. Morrel, however, extended his arm, and commanded silence. “And I say that murders _are_ committed here,” said Morrel, whose\nvoice, though lower in tone, lost none of its terrible distinctness: “I\ntell you that this is the fourth victim within the last four months. I\ntell you, Valentine’s life was attempted by poison four days ago,\nthough she escaped, owing to the precautions of M. Noirtier.

Valentine found her grandmother in bed; silent caresses, heartwrung\nsobs, broken sighs, burning tears, were all that passed in this sad\ninterview, while Madame de Villefort, leaning on her husband’s arm,\nmaintained all outward forms of respect, at least towards the poor\nwidow.

Dantès half feared that such valuable\njewels in the hands of a poor sailor like himself might excite\nsuspicion; but the cunning purchaser asked no troublesome questions\nconcerning a bargain by which he gained a round profit of at least\neighty per cent.

He left the saucepan. Dantès was beside himself with joy. He rapidly devoured his food, and\nafter waiting an hour, lest the jailer should change his mind and\nreturn, he removed his bed, took the handle of the saucepan, inserted\nthe point between the hewn stone and rough stones of the wall, and\nemployed it as a lever. A slight oscillation showed Dantès that all\nwent well. At the end of an hour the stone was extricated from the\nwall, leaving a cavity a foot and a half in diameter. Dantès carefully collected the plaster, carried it into the corner of\nhis cell, and covered it with earth. Then, wishing to make the best use\nof his time while he had the means of labor, he continued to work\nwithout ceasing. At the dawn of day he replaced the stone, pushed his\nbed against the wall, and lay down. The breakfast consisted of a piece\nof bread; the jailer entered and placed the bread on the table. “Well, don’t you intend to bring me another plate?” said Dantès. “No,” replied the turnkey; “you destroy everything. First you break\nyour jug, then you make me break your plate; if all the prisoners\nfollowed your example, the government would be ruined. I shall leave\nyou the saucepan, and pour your soup into that. So for the future I\nhope you will not be so destructive.”\n\nDantès raised his eyes to heaven and clasped his hands beneath the\ncoverlet. He felt more gratitude for the possession of this piece of\niron than he had ever felt for anything. He had noticed, however, that\nthe prisoner on the other side had ceased to labor; no matter, this was\na greater reason for proceeding—if his neighbor would not come to him,\nhe would go to his neighbor.

The iron made no\nimpression, but met with a smooth surface; Dantès touched it, and found\nthat it was a beam.

They approached within a\nhundred paces, so that they could be easily distinguished. Their high\nforeheads, prominent rather than receding, their tall forms, and their\nolive color, showed them to be magnificent types of the Indian race. They were clad in the skins of guanacos, and carried various weapons of\nwar and the chase, while their dexterity in horsemanship was remarkable.

We had no need, then, to take such precautions. There was nothing to\nfear!\" \"Why?\" asked the major. \"Because the Gauchos are inoffensive peasants.\" \"Do you think so, Paganel?\" \"Certainly.

But here a serious\ndisappointment awaited them,--the lake was dry! CHAPTER XVIII. IN SEARCH OF WATER. Lake Salinas terminates the cluster of lagoons that adjoin the Ventana\nand Guamini mountains. Numerous expeditions are made to this place\nto obtain supplies of salt, with which these waters are strongly\nimpregnated. But now the water had evaporated under the heat of the\nsun, and the lake was only a vast glittering basin. When Thalcave announced the presence of a drinkable liquid at Lake\nSalinas, he meant the streams of fresh water that flow from it in\nmany places. But at this time its affluents were as dry as itself. The burning sun had absorbed everything. Hence, the consternation was\ngeneral when the thirsty party arrived at the parched shores of Lake\nSalinas. It was necessary to take counsel. The little water in the leathern\nbottles was half spoiled, and could not quench their thirst, which\nbegan to make itself acutely felt. Hunger and fatigue gave place to\nthis imperative want. A \"roukah,\" a kind of upright tent, of leather,\nwhich stood in a hollow, and had been abandoned by the natives, served\nas a refuge for the travelers, while their horses, stretched on the\nmuddy shores of the lake, ate the saline plants and dry reeds, although\nreluctantly. When each had sat down in the roukah, Paganel asked Thalcave's advice\nas to what was best to be done. A rapid conversation, of which\nGlenarvan caught a few words, ensued between the geographer and the\nIndian. Thalcave spoke calmly, while Paganel gesticulated for both.", "similarity": 0.6818192601203918}, {"chunk_id": 57, "text": "\"Perhaps,\" replied the Patagonian. As soon as this word was translated, Thalcave was surrounded by the\nseven travelers, who gazed at him with questioning looks. Paganel,\nexcited and scarcely finding his words, resumed these interesting\ninterrogatories, while his eyes, fixed upon the grave Indian, strove\nto anticipate his reply before it issued from his lips. Every word the\nPatagonian said he repeated in English, so that his companions heard\nthe Indian speak, as it were, in their own language. \"And this prisoner?\" inquired Paganel. \"He was a stranger,\" replied Thalcave slowly; \"a European.\" \"You have seen him?\" \"No, but he is mentioned in the accounts of the Indians. He was a brave\nman.\" \"You understand, my friends,\" said Paganel; \"a courageous man!\" \"My father!\" cried Robert Grant. Then, addressing Paganel:\n\n\"How do you say 'It is my father,' in Spanish?\" he asked. \"_Es mio padre_,\" answered the geographer. Immediately Robert, taking Thalcave's hands, said in a sweet voice,--\n\n\"_Es mio padre!_\"\n\n\"_Suo padre!_\" replied the Patagonian, whose look brightened. He took the boy in his arms, lifted him from his horse, and gazed at\nhim with the most curious sympathy. His intelligent countenance became\nsuffused with a peaceful emotion. But Paganel had not finished his inquiries. Where was this prisoner? What was he doing? When had Thalcave heard of him? All these questions\nthronged his mind at once. He did not have to wait long for answers,\nbut learnt that the European was a slave of one of the Indian tribes\nthat scour the plains. \"But where was he last?\" asked Paganel. \"With the cazique Calfoucoura,\" answered Thalcave. \"On the line we have been following?\" \"Yes.\" \"And who is this cazique?\" \"The chief of the Poyuches Indians; a man with two tongues and two\nhearts.\" [Sidenote: A SCIENTIFIC BATH.] \"That is to say, false in word and in deed,\" said Paganel, after\ntranslating to his companions this beautiful metaphor of the Indian\nlanguage. \"And can we rescue our friend?\" he added. \"Perhaps so, if your friend is still in the hands of the Indians.\" \"And when did you hear of him?\" \"A long time ago, and, since then, the sun has brought back two summers\nto the sky.\" Glenarvan's joy could not be described. This answer coincided exactly\nwith the date of the document. But one question remained to be asked. \"You speak of a prisoner,\" said Paganel; \"but were there not three?\" \"I do not know,\" replied Thalcave. \"And you know nothing of their actual situation?\" \"Nothing.\" This last word ended the conversation. It was possible that the three\nprisoners had been separated a long time. But the substance of the\nPatagonian's information was that the Indians spoke of a European who\nhad fallen into their power. The date of his captivity, the place where\nhe must have been, everything, even to the Patagonian phrase used to\nexpress his courage, related evidently to Captain Harry Grant. Their progress was now somewhat slow and difficult; their next object\nbeing to reach and cross the river Colorado, to which at length\ntheir horses brought them. Here Paganel's first care was to bathe\n\"geographically\" in its waters, which are colored by a reddish clay.

Towards noon they had to pass around\nthe shores of a small lake, the picturesque reservoir of all the\nneighboring streams which flowed into it. Above the lake extended vast \"llanos,\" lofty plains, covered with\ngrass, where the herds of the Indians grazed. Then they came upon a\nswamp which extended to the south and north, but which the instinct\nof the mules enabled them to avoid. Soon Fort Ballenare appeared on a\nrocky peak which it crowned with its dismantled walls. The ascent had\nalready become abrupt and stony, and the pebbles, loosened by the hoofs\nof the mules, rolled under their feet in a rattling torrent. The road now became difficult, and even perilous. The steepness\nincreased, the walls on either side approached each other more and\nmore, while the precipices yawned frightfully. The mules advanced\ncautiously in single file, with their noses to the ground, scenting the\nway. Now and then, at a sudden turn, the madrina disappeared, and the little\ncaravan was then guided by the distant tinkling of her bell. Sometimes,\ntoo, the capricious windings of the path would bend the column into\ntwo parallel lines, and the catapaz could talk to the peons, while a\ncrevasse, scarcely two fathoms wide, but two hundred deep, formed an\nimpassable abyss between them. Under these conditions it was difficult to distinguish the course. The\nalmost incessant action of subterranean and volcanic agency changes\nthe road, and the landmarks are never the same. Therefore the catapaz\nhesitated, stopped, looked about him, examined the form of the rocks,\nand searched on the crumbling stones for the tracks of Indians. [Illustration]\n\nGlenarvan followed in the steps of his guide. He perceived, he _felt_,\nhis embarrassment, increasing with the difficulties of the way. He did\nnot dare to question him, but thought that it was better to trust to\nthe instinct of the muleteers and mules. For an hour longer the catapaz wandered at a venture, but always\nseeking the more elevated parts of the mountain. At last he was forced\nto stop short. They were at the bottom of a narrow valley,--one of\nthose ravines that the Indians call \"quebradas.\" A perpendicular wall\nof porphyry barred their exit. [Sidenote: CLIMBING A MOUNTAIN.] The catapaz, after searching vainly for a passage, dismounted, folded\nhis arms, and waited. Glenarvan approached him. \"Have you lost your way?\" he asked. \"No, my lord,\" replied the catapaz. \"But we are not at the pass of Antuco?\" \"We are.\" \"Are you not mistaken?\" \"I am not. Here are the remains of a fire made by the Indians, and the\ntracks left by their horses.\" \"Well, they passed this way?\" \"Yes; but we cannot.

Of the natives few were seen; only some \"guassos\" (degenerate children\nof the Indians and Spanish), galloping on horses which they lacerated\nwith the gigantic spurs that adorned their naked feet, and passing\nlike shadows. They met on the way no one who could inform them, and\ninquiries were therefore utterly impossible. [Sidenote: AN ASTONISHED CATAPAZ.] Glenarvan thought that Captain Grant, if prisoner of the Indians, must\nhave been carried by them beyond the Andes. Their search could be\nsuccessful only in the Pampas. They must be patient, and travel on\nswiftly and continuously. [Illustration: By means of a ford, they crossed the Rio Tubal, the\nmountains visible in the distance.] They advanced in the same order as before, which Robert with difficulty\nkept, for his eagerness led him to press forward, to the great\nannoyance of his animal. Nothing but a command from Glenarvan would\nkeep the young boy at his place in the line. The country now became\nmore uneven; and several hillocks indicated that they were approaching\nthe mountains. Paganel still continued his study of Spanish. \"What a language it is!\" exclaimed he; \"so full and sonorous!\" \"But you are making progress, of course?\" replied Glenarvan. \"Certainly, my dear lord. Ah! if there were only no accent! But, alas! there is one!\" In studying this language, Paganel did not, however, neglect his\ngeographical observations. In these, indeed, he was astonishingly\nclever, and could not have found his superior. When Glenarvan\nquestioned the catapaz about some peculiarity of the country, his\nlearned companion would always anticipate the answer of the guide, who\nthen gazed at him with a look of amazement. That same day they met a road which crossed the line that they had\nhitherto pursued. Lord Glenarvan naturally asked its name of their\nguide, and Paganel as naturally answered,--\n\n\"The road from Yumbel to Los Angelos.\" Glenarvan looked at the catapaz. \"Exactly,\" replied he. Then, addressing the geographer, he said,--\n\n\"You have traveled in this country?\" \"Certainly,\" replied Paganel gravely. \"On a mule?\" \"No; in an arm-chair.\" The catapaz did not understand, for he shrugged his shoulders and\nreturned to the head of the troop. At five o'clock in the afternoon they stopped in a shallow gorge, a\nfew miles above the little town of Loja; and that night the travelers\nencamped at the foot of the first slopes of the Andes.

The route through Chili had as yet presented no serious obstacles; but\nnow the dangers that attend a journey across the mountains suddenly\nincreased, the struggle with the natural difficulties was about to\nbegin in earnest. An important question had to be decided before starting. By what pass\ncould they cross the Andes with the least departure from the prescribed\ncourse? The catapaz was questioned on this subject. \"I know,\" he replied, \"of but two passes that are practicable in this\npart of the Andes.\" \"Doubtless the pass of Arica,\" said Paganel, \"which was discovered by\nValdivia Mendoza.\" \"Exactly.\" \"And that of Villarica, situated to the south of Nevado.\" \"You are right.\" \"Well, my friend, these two passes have only one difficulty; they will\ncarry us to the south, or the north, farther than we wish.\"", "similarity": 0.5783275961875916}, {"chunk_id": 36, "text": "The peons traveled on foot according to their custom.

Glenarvan, who knew how to travel and conform to the customs of\ndifferent countries, had adopted the Chilian costume for himself and\nhis friends. Paganel and Robert, two children (a large and a small\none), felt no pleasure in introducing their heads into the national\nponcho (a large blanket with a hole in the centre), and their legs\ninto leathern stirrups. They would rather have seen their mules\nrichly caparisoned, with the Arab bit in their mouths, a long bridle\nof braided leather for a whip, and their heads adorned with metal\nornaments and the \"alforjas\" (double saddle-bags containing the\nprovisions). [Sidenote: LAND AND WATER.] Paganel, always absent-minded, received three or four kicks from his\nexcellent animal just as he was mounting. Once in the saddle, however,\nwith his inseparable telescope in a sling and his feet confined in the\nstirrups, he confided himself to the sagacity of his beast, and had\nno reason to repent. As for young Robert, he showed from the first a\nremarkable capacity for becoming an excellent horseman. [Illustration]\n\nThey started. The day was magnificent, the sky was perfectly clear,\nand the atmosphere sufficiently refreshed by the sea-breezes in spite\nof the heat of the sun. The little party followed at a rapid pace the\nwinding shores of the bay, and made good progress the first day across\nthe reeds of old dried marshes. Little was said. The parting farewells\nhad left a deep impression upon the minds of all. They could still see\nthe smoke of the Duncan as she gradually disappeared on the horizon. All were silent, except Paganel; this studious geographer kept asking\nhimself questions, and answering them, in his new language. The catapaz was, moreover, quite a taciturn man, whose avocation had\nnot made him loquacious. He scarcely spoke to his peons, for they\nunderstood their duty very well. Whenever a mule stopped, they urged\nhim with a guttural cry. If this did not suffice, a good pebble thrown\nwith sure aim overcame his obstinacy.", "similarity": 0.47612613439559937}]}

It was necessary to be prepared for any\nemergency. The Indian detachment was soon perceived. It consisted of only ten\nmen, which fact reassured the Patagonian. They approached within a\nhundred paces, so that they could be easily distinguished. Their high\nforeheads, prominent rather than receding, their tall forms, and their\nolive color, showed them to be magnificent types of the Indian race. They were clad in the skins of guanacos, and carried various weapons of\nwar and the chase, while their dexterity in horsemanship was remarkable. [Illustration]\n\nHaving halted, they appeared to hold a conference, crying and\ngesticulating. Glenarvan advanced toward them; but he had not proceeded\ntwo yards, when the detachment wheeled about and disappeared with\nincredible swiftness. The tired horses of the travelers could never\nhave overtaken them. \"The cowards!\" cried Paganel. \"They fly too fast for honest men,\" said MacNabb. \"What are these Indians?\" inquired Paganel of Thalcave. \"Gauchos!\" replied the Patagonian. \"Gauchos!\" repeated Paganel, turning toward his companions, \"Gauchos! We had no need, then, to take such precautions. There was nothing to\nfear!\" \"Why?\" asked the major. \"Because the Gauchos are inoffensive peasants.\" \"Do you think so, Paganel?\" \"Certainly. They took us for robbers, and fled.\" Glenarvan was quite disappointed in not speaking with them, as he\nexpected to obtain additional tidings of the lost sailors; but it\nwas necessary to push on, if they would reach their destination that\nevening. At eight o'clock Thalcave, who had gone a little in advance, announced\nthat the lake so long desired was in sight. A quarter of an hour\nafterward the little party descended the high banks. But here a serious\ndisappointment awaited them,--the lake was dry! CHAPTER XVIII. IN SEARCH OF WATER. Lake Salinas terminates the cluster of lagoons that adjoin the Ventana\nand Guamini mountains. Numerous expeditions are made to this place\nto obtain supplies of salt, with which these waters are strongly\nimpregnated. But now the water had evaporated under the heat of the\nsun, and the lake was only a vast glittering basin. When Thalcave announced the presence of a drinkable liquid at Lake\nSalinas, he meant the streams of fresh water that flow from it in\nmany places. But at this time its affluents were as dry as itself. The burning sun had absorbed everything. Hence, the consternation was\ngeneral when the thirsty party arrived at the parched shores of Lake\nSalinas. It was necessary to take counsel. The little water in the leathern\nbottles was half spoiled, and could not quench their thirst, which\nbegan to make itself acutely felt. Hunger and fatigue gave place to\nthis imperative want. A \"roukah,\" a kind of upright tent, of leather,\nwhich stood in a hollow, and had been abandoned by the natives, served\nas a refuge for the travelers, while their horses, stretched on the\nmuddy shores of the lake, ate the saline plants and dry reeds, although\nreluctantly. When each had sat down in the roukah, Paganel asked Thalcave's advice\nas to what was best to be done. A rapid conversation, of which\nGlenarvan caught a few words, ensued between the geographer and the\nIndian. Thalcave spoke calmly, while Paganel gesticulated for both.", "similarity": 0.6350272297859192}, {"chunk_id": 57, "text": "\"Perhaps,\" replied the Patagonian. As soon as this word was translated, Thalcave was surrounded by the\nseven travelers, who gazed at him with questioning looks. Paganel,\nexcited and scarcely finding his words, resumed these interesting\ninterrogatories, while his eyes, fixed upon the grave Indian, strove\nto anticipate his reply before it issued from his lips. Every word the\nPatagonian said he repeated in English, so that his companions heard\nthe Indian speak, as it were, in their own language. \"And this prisoner?\" inquired Paganel. \"He was a stranger,\" replied Thalcave slowly; \"a European.\" \"You have seen him?\" \"No, but he is mentioned in the accounts of the Indians. He was a brave\nman.\" \"You understand, my friends,\" said Paganel; \"a courageous man!\" \"My father!\" cried Robert Grant. Then, addressing Paganel:\n\n\"How do you say 'It is my father,' in Spanish?\" he asked. \"_Es mio padre_,\" answered the geographer. Immediately Robert, taking Thalcave's hands, said in a sweet voice,--\n\n\"_Es mio padre!_\"\n\n\"_Suo padre!_\" replied the Patagonian, whose look brightened. He took the boy in his arms, lifted him from his horse, and gazed at\nhim with the most curious sympathy. His intelligent countenance became\nsuffused with a peaceful emotion. But Paganel had not finished his inquiries. Where was this prisoner? What was he doing? When had Thalcave heard of him? All these questions\nthronged his mind at once. He did not have to wait long for answers,\nbut learnt that the European was a slave of one of the Indian tribes\nthat scour the plains. \"But where was he last?\" asked Paganel. \"With the cazique Calfoucoura,\" answered Thalcave. \"On the line we have been following?\" \"Yes.\" \"And who is this cazique?\" \"The chief of the Poyuches Indians; a man with two tongues and two\nhearts.\" [Sidenote: A SCIENTIFIC BATH.] \"That is to say, false in word and in deed,\" said Paganel, after\ntranslating to his companions this beautiful metaphor of the Indian\nlanguage. \"And can we rescue our friend?\" he added. \"Perhaps so, if your friend is still in the hands of the Indians.\" \"And when did you hear of him?\" \"A long time ago, and, since then, the sun has brought back two summers\nto the sky.\" Glenarvan's joy could not be described. This answer coincided exactly\nwith the date of the document. But one question remained to be asked. \"You speak of a prisoner,\" said Paganel; \"but were there not three?\" \"I do not know,\" replied Thalcave. \"And you know nothing of their actual situation?\" \"Nothing.\" This last word ended the conversation. It was possible that the three\nprisoners had been separated a long time. But the substance of the\nPatagonian's information was that the Indians spoke of a European who\nhad fallen into their power. The date of his captivity, the place where\nhe must have been, everything, even to the Patagonian phrase used to\nexpress his courage, related evidently to Captain Harry Grant. Their progress was now somewhat slow and difficult; their next object\nbeing to reach and cross the river Colorado, to which at length\ntheir horses brought them. Here Paganel's first care was to bathe\n\"geographically\" in its waters, which are colored by a reddish clay. He\nwas surprised to find the depth so great as it really was, this being\nthe result of the snow having melted rapidly under the first heat of\nsummer.", "similarity": 0.5819594860076904}, {"chunk_id": 59, "text": "The next day they resumed their journey towards the east. About noon\na change took place in the appearance of the Pampas, which could\nnot escape eyes wearied with its monotony. The grass became more and\nmore scanty, and gave place to sickly burdocks and gigantic thistles;\nwhile stunted nettles and other thorny shrubs grew here and there. Heretofore, a certain moisture, preserved by the clay of the prairie,\nfreshened the meadows; the vegetation was thick and luxuriant. But now\na patchy growth, bare in many places, exposed the earth, and indicated\nthe poverty of the soil. These signs of increasing dryness could not be\nmistaken, and Thalcave called attention to them. [Illustration]\n\n\"I am not sorry at this change,\" said Tom Austin; \"to see always grass,\nnothing but grass, becomes tiresome before long.\" \"But where there is grass there is water,\" replied the major. \"Oh, we are not in want,\" said Wilson, \"and shall find some river on\nour course.\" However, when Wilson said that the supply of water would not fail\nhe had not calculated for the unquenchable thirst that consumed his\ncompanions all that day; and, when he added that they would meet with\nsome stream in their journey he had anticipated too much. Indeed, not\nonly were rivers wanting, but even the artificial wells dug by the\nIndians were empty. On seeing these indications of dryness increase\nfrom mile to mile, Paganel asked Thalcave where he expected to find\nwater. \"At Lake Salinas,\" replied the Indian. \"And when shall we arrive there?\" \"To-morrow evening.\" The natives ordinarily, when they travel on the Pampas, dig wells, and\nfind water a few feet below the surface; but the travelers, destitute\nof the necessary implements, could not employ this expedient. It was\ntherefore necessary to obtain a supply in some other way, for, if they\ndid not absolutely suffer from the tormenting desire for drink, no one\ncould entirely allay his thirst. At evening they halted, after a journey of thirty miles. Every one\nrelied upon a good night to recruit himself after the fatigues of\nthe day; but they were greatly annoyed by a very persistent swarm of\nmosquitoes, which disappeared, however, after the wind changed. If the major preserved his calmness in the midst of the petty\nannoyances of life, Paganel, on the contrary, could not treat the\nmatter so indifferently. He fought the mosquitoes, and sadly regretted\nthe absence of his acid-water, which would have soothed the pain of\ntheir bites. Although the major endeavored to console him, he awoke in\na very bad humor. However, he was very easily persuaded to set out at daybreak, for it\nwas important to arrive at Lake Salinas the same day. The horses were\nvery much exhausted: they were dying of thirst; and, although their\nriders had denied themselves on their account, still their share of\nwater had been very limited. The dryness was to-day even greater, and\nthe heat no less intolerable, with the dusty wind, the simoom of the\nPampas. [Sidenote: INDIANS AHEAD!] During the day the monotony of the journey was interrupted. Mulready,\nwho rode in advance, turned back, signaling the approach of a party of\nIndians. This meeting elicited different opinions. Glenarvan thought\nof the information that these natives might furnish concerning the\nshipwrecked seamen of the Britannia.

According to Thalcave's orders, they advanced in close ranks, and\nat evening encamped in a spacious abandoned rancho, where the chief\nCatriel generally assembled his bands of natives. From an examination\nof the ground and the absence of fresh tracks, the Patagonian knew that\nit had not been occupied for a long time. The next morning Glenarvan and his companions found themselves again\non the plain. The first estancias (vast establishments for raising\ncattle), which border upon the Tandil, were descried; but Thalcave\nresolved not to stop, but to keep straight on to Fort Independence,\nwhere he wished to obtain information, especially concerning the\nsingular condition of this abandoned country. The trees, so rare since leaving the Andes, now reappeared. The greater\npart of these have been planted since the arrival of the Europeans\non the American continent. They generally surround \"corrals,\" vast\ncattle-inclosures protected with stakes. Here thousands of cattle,\nsheep, cows, and horses, branded with the mark of the owner, graze\nand fatten, while large numbers of huge dogs keep watch. The soil is\nadmirably adapted to raising cattle, and yields an excellent fodder. The people lead the life of the shepherds of the Bible. Their flocks\nare perhaps even more numerous than those which fed on the plains of\nMesopotamia; but the family element is wanting, and the owners of the\ngreat folds of the Pampas have little to recommend themselves or their\nmanner of life. Paganel explained all these particulars to his companions, and even\nsucceeded in interesting the major. Thalcave, meanwhile, hastened their progress, as he wished to arrive\nthat evening at Fort Independence. The horses, urged on by their\nmasters, and following the example of Thaouka, dashed through the\ntall grass. They passed several farms, fortified and defended by deep\nditches. The principal house was provided with an elevated terrace,\nfrom which the inmates could fire upon the plunderers of the plain. Glenarvan might perhaps have obtained here the information that he\nsought; but it was wisest to go to the village of Tandil. They did not\nstop, therefore, and soon the feet of the horses struck the grassy\nsward of the first mountain slopes. An hour afterward the village\nappeared at the bottom of a narrow gorge crowned by the embattled walls\nof Fort Independence. [Illustration: In fact, they were a dozen young children and boys who\nwere drilling very nicely. Their uniform consisted of a striped shirt\nconfined at the waist by a leathern girdle.] CHAPTER XXI. A FALSE TRAIL. Paganel, after giving his companions a brief account of the village of\nTandil, added that they could not fail to obtain information there;\nmoreover, the fort was always garrisoned by a detachment of national\ntroops. Glenarvan, accordingly, put the horses into the stable of a\n\"fonda;\" and Paganel, the major, Robert, and he, under the guidance of\nThalcave, proceeded towards Fort Independence. After ascending the ridges of the mountains for a short time, they\narrived at the postern, rather carelessly guarded by a native sentinel. They passed without difficulty, and inferred either great negligence or\nextreme security. A few soldiers were exercising on the parade-ground\nof the fort, the oldest of whom was not more than twenty and the\nyoungest scarcely ten. In fact, they were a dozen young children and\nboys who were drilling very nicely.", "similarity": 0.5541641712188721}, {"chunk_id": 38, "text": "It was still rich in amaryllis, violets,\ndate-trees, and golden-flowered cactuses. A few animals, among\nothers the ocelot, inhabited the thickets. A heron, a solitary owl,\nthrushes and snipes wary of the talons of the hawk, were the only\nrepresentatives of the feathered tribe. Of the natives few were seen; only some \"guassos\" (degenerate children\nof the Indians and Spanish), galloping on horses which they lacerated\nwith the gigantic spurs that adorned their naked feet, and passing\nlike shadows. They met on the way no one who could inform them, and\ninquiries were therefore utterly impossible. [Sidenote: AN ASTONISHED CATAPAZ.] Glenarvan thought that Captain Grant, if prisoner of the Indians, must\nhave been carried by them beyond the Andes. Their search could be\nsuccessful only in the Pampas. They must be patient, and travel on\nswiftly and continuously. [Illustration: By means of a ford, they crossed the Rio Tubal, the\nmountains visible in the distance.] They advanced in the same order as before, which Robert with difficulty\nkept, for his eagerness led him to press forward, to the great\nannoyance of his animal. Nothing but a command from Glenarvan would\nkeep the young boy at his place in the line. The country now became\nmore uneven; and several hillocks indicated that they were approaching\nthe mountains. Paganel still continued his study of Spanish. \"What a language it is!\" exclaimed he; \"so full and sonorous!\" \"But you are making progress, of course?\" replied Glenarvan. \"Certainly, my dear lord. Ah! if there were only no accent! But, alas! there is one!\" In studying this language, Paganel did not, however, neglect his\ngeographical observations. In these, indeed, he was astonishingly\nclever, and could not have found his superior. When Glenarvan\nquestioned the catapaz about some peculiarity of the country, his\nlearned companion would always anticipate the answer of the guide, who\nthen gazed at him with a look of amazement. That same day they met a road which crossed the line that they had\nhitherto pursued. Lord Glenarvan naturally asked its name of their\nguide, and Paganel as naturally answered,--\n\n\"The road from Yumbel to Los Angelos.\" Glenarvan looked at the catapaz. \"Exactly,\" replied he. Then, addressing the geographer, he said,--\n\n\"You have traveled in this country?\" \"Certainly,\" replied Paganel gravely. \"On a mule?\" \"No; in an arm-chair.\" The catapaz did not understand, for he shrugged his shoulders and\nreturned to the head of the troop. At five o'clock in the afternoon they stopped in a shallow gorge, a\nfew miles above the little town of Loja; and that night the travelers\nencamped at the foot of the first slopes of the Andes. CHAPTER XII. ELEVEN THOUSAND FEET ALOFT. The route through Chili had as yet presented no serious obstacles; but\nnow the dangers that attend a journey across the mountains suddenly\nincreased, the struggle with the natural difficulties was about to\nbegin in earnest. An important question had to be decided before starting. By what pass\ncould they cross the Andes with the least departure from the prescribed\ncourse? The catapaz was questioned on this subject. \"I know,\" he replied, \"of but two passes that are practicable in this\npart of the Andes.\" \"Doubtless the pass of Arica,\" said Paganel, \"which was discovered by\nValdivia Mendoza.\" \"Exactly.\" \"And that of Villarica, situated to the south of Nevado.\" \"You are right.\" \"Well, my friend, these two passes have only one difficulty; they will\ncarry us to the south, or the north, farther than we wish.\"", "similarity": 0.573533296585083}]}

Never within his\nrecollection, since he had performed the office of guide, had his feet\ntrodden a soil so saturated.

Paganel was forced to be contented with this answer, and communicated\nto Glenarvan the result of the conversation. \"And what does Thalcave advise?\" inquired Glenarvan. \"What is to be done?\" asked Paganel of the Patagonian. \"Advance quickly,\" replied the Indian. This advice was easier to give than to follow. The horses were quickly\nfatigued with treading a soil that sank beneath them deeper and deeper\nas they progressed, so that this part of the plain might have been\ncompared to an immense basin in which the invading waters would rapidly\naccumulate. It was advisable, therefore, to cross without delay these\nsloping terraces that an inundation would have instantly transformed\ninto a lake. They hastened their pace, though there was no great depth to the water\nwhich spread out in a sheet beneath the horses' feet. About two o'clock\nthe flood-gates of the heavens opened, and tropical torrents of rain\ndescended. Never was a finer opportunity presented for showing oneself\na philosopher. There was no chance of escaping this deluge, and it was\nbetter for the travelers to receive it stoically. Their ponchos were\nsoon dripping, and their hats wet them still more, like roofs whose\ngutters have overflowed. The fringes of the saddle-cloths seemed so\nmany liquid streams; and the horsemen, bespattered by their animals,\nwhose hoofs splashed in the water at every step, rode in a double\nshower, which came from the ground as well as the sky. [Sidenote: HYDROPATHIC TREATMENT.] It was in this wretchedly cold and exhausted state that they arrived,\ntowards evening, at a very miserable rancho. Only people who were not\nfastidious could have given it the name of a shelter, only travelers in\ndistress would consent to occupy it. But Glenarvan and his companions\nhad no choice. They therefore cowered down in the abandoned hut which\nwould not have satisfied even a poor Indian of the plains. A sorry\nfire of grass, which gave out more smoke than heat, was kindled with\ndifficulty. The torrents of rain made havoc without, and large drops\noozed through the mouldy thatch. The fire was extinguished twenty\ntimes, and twenty times did Wilson and Mulready struggle against the\ninvading water. The supper was very meagre and comfortless, and every one's appetite\nfailed.

As for Paganel,\nlike a Frenchman, he tried to joke; but now he failed. \"My jokes are wet,\" said he: \"they miss fire.\" However, as it was more agreeable--if possible, under the\ncircumstances--to sleep, each one sought in slumber a temporary\nforgetfulness of his fatigues. The night was stormy. The sides of the rancho cracked as if they would\nbreak, while the frail structure bent beneath the gusts of wind and\nthreatened to give way at every shock.

The\ndanger was increasing every moment. Already the broken stakes were\nyielding to the teeth and claws of the wolves. But neither Glenarvan\nnor Thalcave appeared willing to yield. The Indian had drawn Glenarvan\ntowards the entrance of the inclosure. He pointed to the plain, now\nfree from wolves. In his animated language, he explained that not a\nmoment was to be lost; that the danger, if this plan failed, would be\ngreater for those who remained; in short, that he alone knew Thaouka\nwell enough to employ his marvelous agility and speed for the common\nsafety. Glenarvan blindly persisted in his resolve to sacrifice\nhimself, when suddenly he was pushed violently back. Thaouka pranced,\nreared on his hind legs, and all at once, with a spring, cleared the\nbarrier of fire and the rampart of bodies, while a boyish voice cried,--\n\n\"God save you, my lord!\" Glenarvan and Thalcave had scarcely time to perceive Robert, who,\nclinging to the horse's mane, disappeared in the darkness. \"Robert, unfortunate!\" cried Glenarvan. But these words the Indian himself could not hear. Frightful howls\nresounded. The wolves, starting on the track of the horse, fled into\nthe darkness with a terrible speed. Thalcave and Glenarvan rushed out of the ramada. Already the plain had\nresumed its tranquillity, and they could scarcely distinguish a moving\nline which undulated afar in the shadows of the night.

He gazed at Thalcave, who smiled with his accustomed calmness. \"Thaouka--good horse--brave child--he will be saved!\" he repeated,\nnodding his head. \"But if he falls?\" said Glenarvan. \"He will not fall!\" In spite of Thalcave's confidence, his companion passed the night in\nterrible anguish.

The major, like a perfect horseman,\nadmired unreservedly this specimen of the horses of the plains. This\nbeautiful creature was called Thaouka, which means \"bird\" in the\nPatagonian language, and he justly merited this appellation. [Sidenote: A FRESH START.] When Thalcave was in the saddle, the horse pranced with spirited grace,\nand the Patagonian, a skillful rider, was magnificent to behold. His\noutfit comprised two weapons of the chase, the \"bolas\" and the lasso. The bolas consists of three balls tied together by a leathern string,\nwhich are fastened to the front of the saddle. The Indians frequently\nthrow them the distance of a hundred paces at the animal or enemy that\nthey are pursuing, and with such precision that they twist about their\nlegs and bring them to the ground. It is, therefore, in their hands a\nformidable instrument, and they handle it with surprising dexterity. The lasso, on the contrary, does not leave the hand that wields it. It\nconsists simply of a leathern thong thirty feet in length, terminating\nin a slip-noose which works upon an iron ring. The right hand throws\nthe slip-noose, while the left hand holds the remainder of the lasso,\nthe end of which is firmly tied to the saddle. A long carbine in a\nsling completed the Patagonian's armament. Thalcave, without observing the admiration caused by his natural\ngrace, ease and courage, took the lead, and the party advanced, now\nat a gallop, and now at a walk, for their horses seemed entirely\nunaccustomed to trotting. Robert mounted with much boldness, and\nspeedily convinced Glenarvan of his ability to keep his seat. On issuing from the gorges of the Andes, they encountered a great\nnumber of sand-ridges, called \"medanos,\" real waves incessantly\nagitated by the wind, when the roots of the herbage did not confine\nthem to the earth. This sand is of an extreme fineness; and, at the\nleast breath, they saw it float away in light clouds, or form regular\nsand-columns which rose to a considerable height. This spectacle caused\npleasure as well as annoyance to the eyes. Pleasure, for nothing was\nmore curious than these columns, wandering over the plain, struggling,\nmingling, sinking and rising in inexpressible confusion; and annoyance,\nsince an impalpable dust emanated from these innumerable medanos and\npenetrated the eyelids, however tightly they were closed. [Illustration]\n\nThis phenomenon continued during a great part of the day. Nevertheless,\nthey advanced rapidly, and towards six o'clock the Andes, forty miles\ndistant, presented a darkish aspect already fading in the mists of the\nevening. The travelers were a little fatigued with their journey, and,\ntherefore, saw with pleasure the approach of the hour for retiring. They encamped on the shores of a turbulent stream, enclosed by lofty\nred cliffs. Toward noon of the next day, the sun's rays became very\noppressive, and at evening a line of clouds on the horizon indicated\na change in the weather. The Patagonian could not be deceived, and\npointed out to the geographer the western portion of the sky. \"Good, I know,\" said Paganel, and addressing his companions: \"A change\nin the weather is about to take place. We shall have a 'pampero.'\" [Sidenote: TALKING LIKE A BOOK.]", "similarity": 0.35214126110076904}, {"chunk_id": 75, "text": "He was by parentage a\nBasque, and his name was Manuel Ipharaguerre. A year after his arrival\nin the country, Sergeant Manuel was naturalized, joined the Argentine\narmy, and married an honest Indian woman, who had twins,--boys, to be\nsure, for the sergeant's worthy consort would never present him with\ndaughters. Manuel did not think of any other calling than that of the\nsoldier, and hoped, in time, with the help of God, to offer to the\nrepublic a whole battalion of young soldiers. \"You have seen them?\" said he. \"Charming fellows! Good soldiers! José! Juan! Miguel! Pepe! Pepe is only seven years old, and is already biting\nhis cartridge!\" Pepe, hearing himself complimented, joined his two little feet, and\npresented arms with perfect precision. \"He will do!\" added the sergeant. \"He will be a major--or\nbrigadier-general one day!\" This story lasted a quarter of an hour, to Thalcave's great\nastonishment. The Indian could not understand how so many words could\ncome from a single throat. No one interrupted the commander; and even\na French sergeant had to conclude at last, though not without forcing\nhis guests to accompany him to his dwelling. Here they were introduced\nto Madame Ipharaguerre, who appeared to be \"a good-looking person,\" if\nthis expression may be employed in regard to an Indian. When he had exhausted himself, the sergeant asked his guests to what he\nowed the honor of their visit. And now it was their turn to explain. Paganel, opening the conversation in French, told him of their journey\nacross the Pampas, and ended by asking why the Indians had abandoned\nthe country. \"War!\" replied the sergeant. \"War?\" \"Yes, civil war.\" \"Civil war?\" rejoined Paganel. \"Yes, war between Paraguay and Buenos Ayres,\" answered the sergeant. \"Well?\" \"Why, all the Indians of the north are in the rear of General Flores,\nand those of the plains are plundering.\" \"But the caziques?\" \"The caziques with them.\" This answer was reported to Thalcave, who shook his head. Indeed,\nhe either did not know, or had forgotten, that a civil war, which\nwas afterwards to involve Brazil, was decimating two-thirds of the\nrepublic. The Indians had everything to gain in these internal\nstruggles, and could not neglect such fine opportunities for plunder. The sergeant, therefore, was not mistaken in attributing this desertion\nof the Pampas to the civil war that was being waged in the northern\npart of the Argentine Provinces. But this event disconcerted Glenarvan's hopes. If Captain Grant was\na prisoner of the caziques, he must have been carried by them to the\nnorthern frontiers. Yet how and where to find him? Must they attempt\na perilous and almost useless search to the northern limits of the\nPampas? It was a serious matter, which was to be earnestly considered. However, one important question was still to be asked of the sergeant,\nand the major thought of this, while his companions were looking at\neach other in silence. \"Have you heard of any Europeans being retained as prisoners by the\ncaziques of the Pampas?\" Manuel reflected for a few moments, like a man who recalls events to\nrecollection. \"Yes,\" said he, at length. \"Ah!\" cried Glenarvan, conceiving a new hope. [Sidenote: REVELATIONS.] Paganel, MacNabb, Robert, and he now surrounded the sergeant. \"Speak, speak!\" cried they, gazing at him with eagerness even in their\nlooks. \"Several years ago,\" replied Manuel, \"yes,--that is it,--European\nprisoners--but have never seen them.\" \"Several years ago?\" said Glenarvan. \"You are mistaken.
