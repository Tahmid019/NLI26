Look!\"\n\nAnd all saw, indeed, that an inexplicable change had taken place in the\nmovements of the Maoris. Their pursuit had been suddenly interrupted.\nTheir ascent of the mountain had ceased, as if by an imperious\ninterdict. The crowd of natives had checked their swiftness, and\nhalted, like the waves of the sea before an impassable rock.\n\nAll the savages, thirsting for blood, were now ranged along the foot\nof the mountain, yelling, gesticulating, and brandishing guns and\nhatchets; but they did not advance a single foot. Their dogs, like\nthemselves, as though chained to earth, howled with rage.\n\nWhat was the difficulty? What invisible power restrained the natives?\nThe fugitives gazed without comprehending, fearing that the charm that\nenchained Kai-Koumou's tribe would dissolve.\n\nSuddenly Captain Mangles uttered a cry that caused his companions to\nturn. He pointed to a little fortress at the summit of the peak.\n\n\"The tomb of the chief Kara-Tété!\" cried Robert.\n\n\"Are you in earnest?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"Yes, my lord, it is the tomb; I recognize it.\"\n\nRobert was right. Fifty feet above, at the extreme point of the\nmountain, stood a small palisaded inclosure of freshly-painted stakes.\nGlenarvan, likewise, recognized the sepulchre of the Maori chief. In\ntheir wanderings they had come to the top of the Maunganamu, where\nKara-Tété had been buried.\n\nFollowed by his companions, he climbed the sides of the peak, to the\nvery foot of the tomb. A large opening, covered with mats, formed the\nentrance. Glenarvan was about to enter, when, all at once, he started\nback suddenly.\n\n\"A savage!\" said he.\n\n\"A savage in this tomb?\" inquired the major.\n\n\"Yes, MacNabb.\"\n\n\"What matter? Let us enter.\"\n\nGlenarvan, the major, Robert, and Captain Mangles passed into the\ninclosure. A Maori was there, clad in a great flax mantle. The darkness\nof the sepulchre did not permit them to distinguish his features. He\nappeared very calm, and was eating his breakfast with the most perfect\nindifference.\n\nGlenarvan was about to address him, when the native, anticipating him,\nsaid, in an amiable tone, and in excellent English:\n\n\"Be seated, my dear lord; breakfast is awaiting you.\"\n\nIt was Paganel. At his voice all rushed into the tomb, and gazed with\nwonder at the worthy geographer. Paganel was found! The common safety\nwas represented in him. They were going to question him: they wished\nto know how and why he was on the top of the mountain; but Glenarvan\nchecked this unseasonable curiosity.\n\n[Illustration: \"Be seated, my dear lord; breakfast is awaiting you.\"]\n\n\"The savages!\" said he.\n\n\"The savages,\" replied Paganel, shrugging his shoulders, \"are\nindividuals whom I supremely despise.\"\n\n\"But can they not----?\"\n\n\"They! the imbeciles! Come and see them.\"\n\nEach followed Paganel, who issued from the tomb. The Maoris were in the\nsame place, surrounding the foot of the peak, and uttering terrible\ncries.\n\n\"Cry and howl till you are tired, miserable creatures!\" said Paganel.\n\"I defy you to climb this mountain!\"\n\n\"And why?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"Because the chief is buried here; this tomb protects us, and the\nmountain is tabooed.\"\n\n\"Tabooed?\"\n\n\"Yes, my friends; and that is why I took refuge here, as in one of\nthose asylums of the Middle Ages, open to unfortunates.\"\n\nIndeed, the mountain was tabooed, and by this consecration had become\ninaccessible by the superstitious savages.\n\nThe safety of the fugitives was not yet certain, but there was a\nsalutary respite, of which they strove to take advantage. Glenarvan, a\nprey to unspeakable emotion, did not venture a word; while the major\nnodded his head with an air of genuine satisfaction.\n\n\"And now, my friends,\" said Paganel, \"if these brutes expect us to test\ntheir patience they are mistaken.

A malicious smile passed\nover his face; but he almost instantly repressed it, and replied, in a\nvoice which he could scarcely control:\n\n\"Do you hope, then, to deceive Kai-Koumou by false words, cursed\nEuropean? Do you think that Kai-Koumou's eyes cannot read your heart?\"\n\nThen, pointing to Lady Helena, he said:\n\n\"That is your wife!\"\n\n\"No, mine!\" cried Kara-Tété.\n\nThen, pushing back the prisoners, the chief laid his hand on Lady\nHelena's shoulder, who grew pale at the touch.\n\n\"Edward!\" cried the unfortunate woman, in terror.\n\nGlenarvan, without uttering a word, raised his arm.

And that very evening the prisoners\nsketched a plan of education, to be entered upon the following day.\nDantès possessed a prodigious memory, combined with an astonishing\nquickness and readiness of conception; the mathematical turn of his\nmind rendered him apt at all kinds of calculation, while his naturally\npoetical feelings threw a light and pleasing veil over the dry reality\nof arithmetical computation, or the rigid severity of geometry.

Welcome, welcome!

Glenarvan would\ngladly have put in a word in regard to his affairs, but the soldier\nwas telling his story, and was not in the mood to be interrupted.\nThis honest man had left France a long time before; and the native\nlanguage was no longer perfectly familiar to him: he had forgotten,\nif not words, at least the manner of combining them. As his visitors\nsoon learned, he had been a sergeant in the French army. Since the\nfoundation of the fort he had not left it, and commanded it by\nappointment from the Argentine government. He was by parentage a\nBasque, and his name was Manuel Ipharaguerre. A year after his arrival\nin the country, Sergeant Manuel was naturalized, joined the Argentine\narmy, and married an honest Indian woman, who had twins,--boys, to be\nsure, for the sergeant's worthy consort would never present him with\ndaughters. Manuel did not think of any other calling than that of the\nsoldier, and hoped, in time, with the help of God, to offer to the\nrepublic a whole battalion of young soldiers.\n\n\"You have seen them?\" said he. \"Charming fellows! Good soldiers! José!\nJuan! Miguel! Pepe! Pepe is only seven years old, and is already biting\nhis cartridge!\"\n\nPepe, hearing himself complimented, joined his two little feet, and\npresented arms with perfect precision.\n\n\"He will do!\" added the sergeant. \"He will be a major--or\nbrigadier-general one day!\"\n\nThis story lasted a quarter of an hour, to Thalcave's great\nastonishment. The Indian could not understand how so many words could\ncome from a single throat. No one interrupted the commander; and even\na French sergeant had to conclude at last, though not without forcing\nhis guests to accompany him to his dwelling. Here they were introduced\nto Madame Ipharaguerre, who appeared to be \"a good-looking person,\" if\nthis expression may be employed in regard to an Indian.\n\nWhen he had exhausted himself, the sergeant asked his guests to what he\nowed the honor of their visit. And now it was their turn to explain.\n\nPaganel, opening the conversation in French, told him of their journey\nacross the Pampas, and ended by asking why the Indians had abandoned\nthe country.\n\n\"War!\" replied the sergeant.\n\n\"War?\"\n\n\"Yes, civil war.\"\n\n\"Civil war?\" rejoined Paganel.\n\n\"Yes, war between Paraguay and Buenos Ayres,\" answered the sergeant.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Why, all the Indians of the north are in the rear of General Flores,\nand those of the plains are plundering.\"\n\n\"But the caziques?\"\n\n\"The caziques with them.\"\n\nThis answer was reported to Thalcave, who shook his head. Indeed,\nhe either did not know, or had forgotten, that a civil war, which\nwas afterwards to involve Brazil, was decimating two-thirds of the\nrepublic. The Indians had everything to gain in these internal\nstruggles, and could not neglect such fine opportunities for plunder.\nThe sergeant, therefore, was not mistaken in attributing this desertion\nof the Pampas to the civil war that was being waged in the northern\npart of the Argentine Provinces.\n\nBut this event disconcerted Glenarvan's hopes. If Captain Grant was\na prisoner of the caziques, he must have been carried by them to the\nnorthern frontiers. Yet how and where to find him? Must they attempt\na perilous and almost useless search to the northern limits of the\nPampas? It was a serious matter, which was to be earnestly considered.\n\nHowever, one important question was still to be asked of the sergeant,\nand the major thought of this, while his companions were looking at\neach other in silence.\n\n\"Hav", "label": "CONTRADICT"}

It was a palisade of red painted stakes.\nSymbolical faces, a real tattooing on wood, described the nobleness\nand exploits of the deceased. Strings of pipes, shells, and carved\nstones extended from one stake to another. Inside, the earth was hidden\nbeneath a carpet of green leaves. In the centre a slight protuberance\nmarked the freshly-made grave. Here reposed the weapons of the chief,\nhis guns loaded and primed, his lance, his splendid hatchet of green\njade, with a supply of powder and balls sufficient for the hunts of the\nother world.\n\n\"Here is a whole arsenal,\" said Paganel, \"of which we will make a\nbetter use than the deceased.

At all events, these guns will be useful to\nus.\"\n\n\"But still more useful,\" said Paganel, \"will be the provisions and\nwater intended for Kara-Tété.\"\n\nThe parents and friends of the dead had, indeed, faithfully fulfilled\ntheir duties. The amount of food testified their esteem for the virtues\nof the chief. There were provisions enough to last ten persons fifteen\ndays, or rather the deceased for eternity. They consisted of ferns,\nsweet yams, and potatoes, which were introduced some time before by the\nEuropeans. Tall vases of fresh water stood near, and a dozen baskets,\nartistically woven, contained numerous tablets of green gum.\n\nThe fugitives were, therefore, fortified for several days against\nhunger and thirst, and they needed no urging to take their first meal\nat the chief's expense.

Glenarvan would\ngladly have put in a word in regard to his affairs, but the soldier\nwas telling his story, and was not in the mood to be interrupted.\nThis honest man had left France a long time before; and the native\nlanguage was no longer perfectly familiar to him: he had forgotten,\nif not words, at least the manner of combining them. As his visitors\nsoon learned, he had been a sergeant in the French army. Since the\nfoundation of the fort he had not left it, and commanded it by\nappointment from the Argentine government. He was by parentage a\nBasque, and his name was Manuel Ipharaguerre. A year after his arrival\nin the country, Sergeant Manuel was naturalized, joined the Argentine\narmy, and married an honest Indian woman, who had twins,--boys, to be\nsure, for the sergeant's worthy consort would never present him with\ndaughters. Manuel did not think of any other calling than that of the\nsoldier, and hoped, in time, with the help of God, to offer to the\nrepublic a whole battalion of young soldiers.\n\n\"You have seen them?\" said he. \"Charming fellows! Good soldiers! José!\nJuan! Miguel! Pepe! Pepe is only seven years old, and is already biting\nhis cartridge!\"\n\nPepe, hearing himself complimented, joined his two little feet, and\npresented arms with perfect precision.\n\n\"He will do!\" added the sergeant. \"He will be a major--or\nbrigadier-general one day!\"\n\nThis story lasted a quarter of an hour, to Thalcave's great\nastonishment. The Indian could not understand how so many words could\ncome from a single throat. No one interrupted the commander; and even\na French sergeant had to conclude at last, though not without forcing\nhis guests to accompany him to his dwelling. Here they were introduced\nto Madame Ipharaguerre, who appeared to be \"a good-looking person,\" if\nthis expression may be employed in regard to an Indian.\n\nWhen he had exhausted himself, the sergeant asked his guests to what he\nowed the honor of their visit. And now it was their turn to explain.\n\nPaganel, opening the conversation in French, told him of their journey\nacross the Pampas, and ended by asking why the Indians had abandoned\nthe country.\n\n\"War!\" replied the sergeant.\n\n\"War?\"\n\n\"Yes, civil war.\"\n\n\"Civil war?\" rejoined Paganel.\n\n\"Yes, war between Paraguay and Buenos Ayres,\" answered the sergeant.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Why, all the Indians of the north are in the rear of General Flores,\nand those of the plains are plundering.\"\n\n\"But the caziques?\"\n\n\"The caziques with them.\"\n\nThis answer was reported to Thalcave, who shook his head. Indeed,\nhe either did not know, or had forgotten, that a civil war, which\nwas afterwards to involve Brazil, was decimating two-thirds of the\nrepublic. The Indians had everything to gain in these internal\nstruggles, and could not neglect such fine opportunities for plunder.\nThe sergeant, therefore, was not mistaken in attributing this desertion\nof the Pampas to the civil war that was being waged in the northern\npart of the Argentine Provinces.\n\nBut this event disconcerted Glenarvan's hopes. If Captain Grant was\na prisoner of the caziques, he must have been carried by them to the\nnorthern frontiers. Yet how and where to find him?

He strove to collect a band of\nfollowers, and followed the footsteps of Decesaris and Gasparone, whom\nhe hoped to surpass. Many young men of Palestrina, Frascati, and\nPampinara had disappeared. Their disappearance at first caused much\ndisquietude; but it was soon known that they had joined Cucumetto.\nAfter some time Cucumetto became the object of universal attention; the\nmost extraordinary traits of ferocious daring and brutality were\nrelated of him.\n\n“One day he carried off a young girl, the daughter of a surveyor of\nFrosinone. The bandit’s laws are positive; a young girl belongs first\nto him who carries her off, then the rest draw lots for her, and she is\nabandoned to their brutality until death relieves her sufferings. When\ntheir parents are sufficiently rich to pay a ransom, a messenger is\nsent to negotiate; the prisoner is hostage for the security of the\nmessenger; should the ransom be refused, the prisoner is irrevocably\nlost. The young girl’s lover was in Cucumetto’s troop; his name was\nCarlini. When she recognized her lover, the poor girl extended her arms\nto him, and believed herself safe; but Carlini felt his heart sink, for\nhe but too well knew the fate that awaited her. However, as he was a\nfavorite with Cucumetto, as he had for three years faithfully served\nhim, and as he had saved his life by shooting a dragoon who was about\nto cut him down, he hoped the chief would have pity on him. He took\nCucumetto one side, while the young girl, seated at the foot of a huge\npine that stood in the centre of the forest, made a veil of her\npicturesque head-dress to hide her face from the lascivious gaze of the\nbandits. There he told the chief all—his affection for the prisoner,\ntheir promises of mutual fidelity, and how every night, since he had\nbeen near, they had met in some neighboring ruins.\n\n20109m\n\n\n\n“It so happened that night that Cucumetto had sent Carlini to a\nvillage, so that he had been unable to go to the place of meeting.\nCucumetto had been there, however, by accident, as he said, and had\ncarried the maiden off. Carlini besought his chief to make an exception\nin Rita’s favor, as her father was rich, and could pay a large ransom.\nCucumetto seemed to yield to his friend’s entreaties, and bade him find\na shepherd to send to Rita’s father at Frosinone.\n\n“Carlini flew joyfully to Rita, telling her she was saved, and bidding\nher write to her father, to inform him what had occurred, and that her\nransom was fixed at three hundred piastres. Twelve hours’ delay was all\nthat was granted—that is, until nine the next morning. The instant the\nletter was written, Carlini seized it, and hastened to the plain to\nfind a messenger. He found a young shepherd watching his flock. The\nnatural messengers of the bandits are the shepherds who live between\nthe city and the mountains, between civilized and savage life. The boy\nundertook the commission, promising to be in Frosinone in less than an\nhour. Carlini returned, anxious to see his mistress, and announce the\njoyful intelligence. He found the troop in the glade, supping off the\nprovisions exacted as contributions from the peasants; but his eye\nvainly sought Rita and Cucumetto among them.\n\n“He inquired where they were, and was answered by a burst of laughter.\nA cold perspiration burst from every pore, and his hair stood on end.\nHe repeated his question. One of the bandits rose, and offered him a\nglass filled with Orvietto, saying, ‘To the health of the brave\nCucumetto and the fair Rita.’ At this moment Carlini heard a woman’s\ncry; he divined the truth, seized the glass, broke it across the face\nof him who presented it, and rushed towards the spot whence the cry\ncame. After a hundred yards he turned the corner of the thicket; he\nfound Rita senseless in the arms of Cucumetto. At the sight of Carlini,\nCucumetto rose, a pistol in each hand.

One night more and he would be on his way.\n\nThe night was one of feverish distraction, and in its progress visions,\ngood and evil, passed through Dantès’ mind. If he closed his eyes, he\nsaw Cardinal Spada’s letter written on the wall in characters of\nflame—if he slept for a moment the wildest dreams haunted his brain. He\nascended into grottos paved with emeralds, with panels of rubies, and\nthe roof glowing with diamond stalactites. Pearls fell drop by drop, as\nsubterranean waters filter in their caves. Edmond, amazed,\nwonderstruck, filled his pockets with the radiant gems and then\nreturned to daylight, when he discovered that his prizes had all\nchanged into common pebbles. He then endeavored to re-enter the\nmarvellous grottos, but they had suddenly receded, and now the path\nbecame a labyrinth, and then the entrance vanished, and in vain did he\ntax his memory for the magic and mysterious word which opened the\nsplendid caverns of Ali Baba to the Arabian fisherman. All was useless,\nthe treasure disappeared, and had again reverted to the genii from whom\nfor a moment he had hoped to carry it off.\n\nThe day came at length, and was almost as feverish as the night had\nbeen, but it brought reason to the aid of imagination, and Dantès was\nthen enabled to arrange a plan which had hitherto been vague and\nunsettled in his brain. Night came, and with it the preparation for\ndeparture, and these preparations served to conceal Dantès’ agitation.\nHe had by degrees assumed such authority over his companions that he\nwas almost like a commander on board; and as his orders were always\nclear, distinct, and easy of execution, his comrades obeyed him with\ncelerity and pleasure.\n\nThe old patron did not interfere, for he too had recognized the\nsuperiority of Dantès over the crew and himself. He saw in the young\nman his natural successor, and regretted that he had not a daughter,\nthat he might have bound Edmond to him by a more secure alliance.

Noirtier was a true prophet, and things progressed rapidly, as he\nhad predicted. Everyone knows the history of the famous return from\nElba, a return which was unprecedented in the past, and will probably\nremain without a counterpart in the future.\n\nLouis XVIII. made but a faint attempt to parry this unexpected blow;\nthe monarchy he had scarcely reconstructed tottered on its precarious\nfoundation, and at a sign from the emperor the incongruous structure of\nancient prejudices and new ideas fell to the ground. Villefort,\ntherefore, gained nothing save the king’s gratitude (which was rather\nlikely to injure him at the present time) and the cross of the Legion\nof Honor, which he had the prudence not to wear, although M. de Blacas\nhad duly forwarded the brevet.\n\nNapoleon would, doubtless, have deprived Villefort of his office had it\nnot been for Noirtier, who was all powerful at court, and thus the\nGirondin of ’93 and the Senator of 1806 protected him who so lately had\nbeen his protector. All Villefort’s influence barely enabled him to\nstifle the secret Dantès had so nearly divulged. The king’s procureur\nalone was deprived of his office, being suspected of royalism.\n\nHowever, scarcely was the imperial power established—that is, scarcely\nhad the emperor re-entered the Tuileries and begun to issue orders from\nthe closet into which we have introduced our readers,—he found on the\ntable there Louis XVIII.’s half-filled snuff-box,—scarcely had this\noccurred when Marseilles began, in spite of the authorities, to\nrekindle the flames of civil war, always smouldering in the south, and\nit required but little to excite the populace to acts of far greater\nviolence than the shouts and insults with which they assailed the\nroyalists whenever they ventured abroad.\n\n0159m\n\n\n\nOwing to this change, the worthy shipowner became at that moment—we\nwill not say all powerful, because Morrel was a prudent and rather a\ntimid man, so much so, that many of the most zealous partisans of\nBonaparte accused him of “moderation”—but sufficiently influential to\nmake a demand in favor of Dantès.\n\nVillefort retained his place, but his marriage was put off until a more\nfavorable opportunity. If the emperor remained on the throne, Gérard\nrequired a different alliance to aid his career; if Louis XVIII.\nreturned, the influence of M. de Saint-Méran, like his own, could be\nvastly increased, and the marriage be still more suitable. The deputy\nprocureur was, therefore, the first magistrate of Marseilles, when one\nmorning his door opened, and M. Morrel was announced.\n\nAnyone else would have hastened to receive him; but Villefort was a man\nof ability, and he knew this would be a sign of weakness. He made\nMorrel wait in the antechamber, although he had no one with him, for\nthe simple reason that the king’s procureur always makes everyone wait,\nand after passing a quarter of an hour in reading the papers, he\nordered M. Morrel to be admitted.\n\nMorrel expected Villefort would be dejected; he found him as he had\nfound him six weeks before, calm, firm, and full of that glacial\npoliteness, that most insurmountable barrier which separates the\nwell-bred from the vulgar man.\n\nHe had entered Villefort’s office expecting that the magistrate would\ntremble at the sight of him; on the contrary, he felt a cold shudder\nall over him when he saw Villefort sitting there with his elbow on his\ndesk, and his head leaning on his hand. He stopped at the door;\nVillefort gazed at him as if he had some difficulty in recognizing him;\nthen, after a brief interval, during which the honest shipowner turned\nhis hat in his hands,\n\n“M. Morrel, I believe?” said Villefort.\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“Come nearer,” said the magistrate, with a patronizing wave of the\nhand, “and tell me to what circumstance I owe the honor of this visit.”\n\n“Do you not guess, monsieur?” asked Morrel.\n\n“Not in the least; but if I can serve you in any way I shall be\ndelighted.”\n", "label": "CONTRADICT"}

The Deputy Procureur du Roi\n\nIn one of the aristocratic mansions built by Puget in the Rue du Grand\nCours opposite the Medusa fountain, a second marriage feast was being\ncelebrated, almost at the same hour with the nuptial repast given by\nDantès. In this case, however, although the occasion of the\nentertainment was similar, the company was strikingly dissimilar.\nInstead of a rude mixture of sailors, soldiers, and those belonging to\nthe humblest grade of life, the present assembly was composed of the\nvery flower of Marseilles society,—magistrates who had resigned their\noffice during the usurper’s reign; officers who had deserted from the\nimperial army and joined forces with Condé; and younger members of\nfamilies, brought up to hate and execrate the man whom five years of\nexile would convert into a martyr, and fifteen of restoration elevate\nto the rank of a god.\n\nThe guests were still at table, and the heated and energetic\nconversation that prevailed betrayed the violent and vindictive\npassions that then agitated each dweller of the South, where unhappily,\nfor five centuries religious strife had long given increased bitterness\nto the violence of party feeling.\n\nThe emperor, now king of the petty Island of Elba, after having held\nsovereign sway over one-half of the world, counting as his subjects a\nsmall population of five or six thousand souls,—after having been\naccustomed to hear the “_Vive Napoléons_” of a hundred and twenty\nmillions of human beings, uttered in ten different languages,—was\nlooked upon here as a ruined man, separated forever from any fresh\nconnection with France or claim to her throne.\n\nThe magistrates freely discussed their political views; the military\npart of the company talked unreservedly of Moscow and Leipsic, while\nthe women commented on the divorce of Josephine. It was not over the\ndownfall of the man, but over the defeat of the Napoleonic idea, that\nthey rejoiced, and in this they foresaw for themselves the bright and\ncheering prospect of a revivified political existence.\n\nAn old man, decorated with the cross of Saint Louis, now rose and\nproposed the health of King Louis XVIII. It was the Marquis de\nSaint-Méran. This toast, recalling at once the patient exile of\nHartwell and the peace-loving King of France, excited universal\nenthusiasm; glasses were elevated in the air _à l’Anglaise_, and the\nladies, snatching their bouquets from their fair bosoms, strewed the\ntable with their floral treasures. In a word, an almost poetical fervor\nprevailed.\n\n“Ah,” said the Marquise de Saint-Méran, a woman with a stern,\nforbidding eye, though still noble and distinguished in appearance,\ndespite her fifty years—“ah, these revolutionists, who have driven us\nfrom those very possessions they afterwards purchased for a mere trifle\nduring the Reign of Terror, would be compelled to own, were they here,\nthat all true devotion was on our side, since we were content to follow\nthe fortunes of a falling monarch, while they, on the contrary, made\ntheir fortune by worshipping the rising sun; yes, yes, they could not\nhelp admitting that the king, for whom we sacrificed rank, wealth, and\nstation was truly our ‘Louis the well-beloved,’ while their wretched\nusurper has been, and ever will be, to them their evil genius, their\n‘Napoleon the accursed.’ Am I not right, Villefort?”\n\n“I beg your pardon, madame. I really must pray you to excuse me, but—in\ntruth—I was not attending to the conversation.”\n\n“Marquise, marquise!” interposed the old nobleman who had proposed the\ntoast, “let the young people alone; let me tell you, on one’s wedding\nday there are more agreeable subjects of conversation than dry\npolitics.”\n\n“Never mind, dearest mother,” said a young and lovely girl, with a\nprofusion of light brown hair, and eyes that seemed to float in liquid\ncrystal, “’tis all my fault for seizing upo", "label": "CONTRADICT"}

Ayrton\nurged Lord Glenarvan to send an order to the Duncan to repair to the\ncoast, that he might have at his disposal all the aid possible in his\nsearch. In his opinion they ought to take advantage of the Lucknow\nroad, which would lead them to Melbourne. Afterwards this might be\ndifficult, for highways leading directly to the capital would be\nabsolutely wanting.\n\nThis advice of the quartermaster seemed reasonable. Paganel seconded\nit. He thought, too, that the yacht would be very useful under the\npresent circumstances, and added that they could no longer communicate\nwith Melbourne after passing the Lucknow road.\n\nGlenarvan was undecided, and perhaps would have sent the order that\nAyrton so particularly desired, if the major had not opposed this plan\nwith great energy. He explained that Ayrton's presence was necessary\nto the expedition; that on approaching the coast the country would be\nunknown; that, if chance set them on the track of Captain Grant, the\nquartermaster would be more capable than any one else of following it;\nin short, that he alone could point out the place where the Britannia\nwas lost.\n\nMacNabb, therefore, advocated their continuing on the journey without\nchange. Captain Mangles was of the same opinion. The young captain\nobserved that his lordship's orders could more easily reach the Duncan\nif sent from Twofold Bay, than by dispatching a messenger two hundred\nmiles over a wild country.\n\nThe major carried his point, and it was therefore decided that they\nshould proceed to Twofold Bay. MacNabb noticed that Ayrton seemed quite\ndisappointed, but he said nothing, and, according to his custom, kept\nhis thoughts to himself.\n\nEarly in the afternoon they passed through a curious forest of ferns.\nThese arborescent plants, in full bloom, measured thirty feet in\nheight. Horses and horsemen could easily pass beneath their drooping\nbranches, and sometimes the rowel of a spur would ring, as it struck\nagainst their solid stalks. The coolness of the grove was very grateful\nto the wearied travelers. Paganel, always demonstrative, gave vent to\nexclamations of delight that startled flocks of parrots and cockatoos.\n\nAll at once his companions saw the geographer reel in the saddle, and\nfall to the ground like a log. Was it giddiness, or sunstroke, caused\nby the heat?\n\nThey hastened to him.\n\n\"Paganel! Paganel! what is the matter?\" cried Lord Glenarvan.\n\n\"The matter is, my dear friend,\" replied Paganel, extricating himself\nfrom the stirrups, \"that I no longer have a horse.\"\n\n\"What! your horse----?\"\n\n\"Is dead, stricken like Mulready's.\"\n\nAt once Glenarvan, Captain Mangles, and Wilson examined the animal.\nPaganel was right. His horse had been suddenly stricken dead.\n\n\"This is singular,\" said the captain.\n\n\"Very singular indeed,\" muttered the major.\n\nGlenarvan could not restrain a feeling of uneasiness at this strange\noccurrence. It was impossible for them to retrace their steps in this\ndesert; while, if an epidemic were to seize all the horses, it would be\nvery difficult to continue the journey.\n\nBefore the end of the day his fears seemed to be justified. A third\nhorse, Wilson's, fell dead, and, what was worse, one of the oxen was\nalso stricken. Their means of conveyance now consisted of only three\noxen and four horses.\n\n[Sidenote: A FINE FERNERY.]\n\nThe situation had grown serious.

No sign\nof disease, however, could be detected. The animals were in perfect\nhealth, and bravely endured the hardships of the journey.

But, as you know, a Corsican who has sworn to\navenge himself cares not for distance, so his carriage, fast as it\nwent, was never above half a day’s journey before me, who followed him\non foot. The most important thing was, not to kill him only—for I had\nan opportunity of doing so a hundred times—but to kill him without\nbeing discovered—at least, without being arrested. I no longer belonged\nto myself, for I had my sister-in-law to protect and provide for.\n\n“For three months I watched M. de Villefort, for three months he took\nnot a step out-of-doors without my following him.

If I wished to surprise him, it was\nevident this was the spot to lie in wait for him. The house belonged,\nas the concierge informed your excellency, to M. de Saint-Méran,\nVillefort’s father-in-law. M. de Saint-Méran lived at Marseilles, so\nthat this country house was useless to him, and it was reported to be\nlet to a young widow, known only by the name of ‘the Baroness.’\n\n“One evening, as I was looking over the wall, I saw a young and\nhandsome woman who was walking alone in that garden, which was not\noverlooked by any windows, and I guessed that she was awaiting M. de\nVillefort. When she was sufficiently near for me to distinguish her\nfeatures, I saw she was from eighteen to nineteen, tall and very fair.\nAs she had a loose muslin dress on and as nothing concealed her figure,\nI saw she would ere long become a mother. A few moments after, the\nlittle door was opened and a man entered. The young woman hastened to\nmeet him. They threw themselves into each other’s arms, embraced\ntenderly, and returned together to the house.

The curiosity of his discoverers having been\nfully satisfied, Toliné was made welcome, and partook with the others\nof the general repast. Many were the plans and purposes concerning\nhim, and much wonder was expressed as to how they could speed him on\nhis way; but in the morning it was discovered that he had solved the\nproblem for himself, and a bouquet of fresh leaves and flowers, laid by\nthe side of Lady Helena's seat, was the only memento that Toliné had\nleft.\n\n[Sidenote: A GOLDEN CITY.]\n\nThe party were now approaching the district which, in the years 1851\nand 1852, was so much talked of throughout the civilized world,\nand attracted from all parts so many reckless adventurers and\nfortune-hunters. The line of the thirty-seventh parallel, on which they\nwere traveling, led them through the diggings and municipality of Mount\nAlexander, which was one of the most successful spots for the digger at\nthe commencement of the gold fever, in consequence of the comparatively\nlevel nature of the ground and the general richness of the soil, so\ndifferent from some other localities where only once in a while was\nsome enormous nugget to be found. As they drew near to the streets of\nthis hastily-built town, Ayrton and Mulready, who were in charge of the\ncart, were sent forward, whilst the others walked through the place to\ninspect what there might be of interest, as well as to ascertain what\nmight be learned concerning the object of their expedition.\n\nThus, in this strange gathering of all nationalities and creeds and\nprofessions, the regular inhabitants beheld a still more extraordinary\nsight than that every day afforded them: folks who to the refinement\nwhich education and civilization give added both the earnestness\nof the worker and the freshness and vigor of the pleasure-seeking\ntourist. In the streets, in connection with the strange sign-boards and\nannouncements, the novel erections and purposes to which some of them\nwere adapted, Paganel had a history and commentary for every one.\n\nStill more did he expatiate upon the thousand-and-one topics of\ninterest when they visited the bank building, which here is the\ncentre of more than one agency connected with this great gold-bearing\ndistrict. Here was the mineralogical museum, in which might be seen\nspecimens illustrative of all the various ways in which the gold has\nbeen found, whether in combination with clay or other minerals, or--as\nit is sometimes, to the great joy of the finder, discovered--_pur\net simple_. Here also were models, diagrams, and even the tools\nthemselves, to illustrate the different methods by which the object\nof search was dug out, or washed, or crushed, or tested. Here also\nwas an almost unequaled collection of precious stones, gems of all\nsorts, making the gallery in which they were placed a real Golconda\nfor its wealth and attractions. Besides all this, here was the centre\nof the varied agencies by which the reports were brought in from the\ncompanies established for mining purposes, and also from each isolated\nworker, of the space purchased, the number of feet or yards dug, the\nore extracted, the comparative richness or poverty of the soil here,\nthere, and elsewhere, which in their summarized and aggregate form have\ngreatly helped to a correct knowledge of the comparative and absolute\ngold-", "label": "NEUTRAL"}

Why was the Duncan on the eastern coast of New Zealand?\nWhy was she not in the hands of Ben Joyce? By what providential working\nhad God restored her to the fugitives? These were the questions that\nwere hurriedly addressed to Tom Austin. The old sailor did not know\nwhich to answer first.

Fortunately, the Guamini flowed at no great distance.\nThey accordingly continued their journey, and at seven o'clock in the\nmorning the little party arrived at the ramada. On seeing its entrance\nstrewn with the bodies of the wolves, it was easy to understand the\nviolence of the attack and the vigor of the defense. The travelers,\nafter fully quenching their thirst, devoted their attention to\nbreakfast in the inclosure. The ostrich-steaks were declared excellent,\nand the armadillo, roasted in its own covering, was a delicious dish.\n\n\"To eat reasonably of this,\" said Paganel, \"would be ingratitude\ntowards Providence. We really must eat immoderately.\"\n\nAnd he did so accordingly,--but was not sick, thanks to the clear water\nof the Guamini, which appeared to possess superior digestive properties.\n\n[Sidenote: AEROSTATIC EXPERIMENTS.]\n\nAt ten o'clock Glenarvan gave the signal for departure. The\nwater-bottles were filled, and they set out. The horses, being greatly\nrevived, evinced much spirit, and maintained an easy and almost\ncontinuous canter. The next morning they crossed the boundary which\nseparates the Argentine Plains from the Pampas. Here Thalcave hoped\nto meet the chiefs in whose hands he doubted not that he should find\nHarry Grant and rescue him and his two companions from slavery.\n\nSince they had left the Guamini, the travelers noticed, with great\nsatisfaction, a considerable change in the temperature, thanks to the\ncold winds of Patagonia, which cause continual currents of air. Neither\nman nor beast had any reason to complain, after suffering so much from\ndryness and heat. They therefore pushed on with courage and confidence.\nBut, whatever might have been said, the country seemed to be entirely\nuninhabited, or, to use a more exact word, \"disinhabited.\"\n\nFrequently they skirted the shores of fresh-water lagoons, on whose\nbanks, in the shelter of the bushes, tiny wrens skipped and melodious\nlarks warbled, in company with the brilliant-plumaged tanagers. These\npretty birds gayly fluttered about, heedless of the haughty starlings\nthat strutted on the banks like soldiers with their epaulettes and red\nbreasts. In the thorny coppices the nests of the annubis swung like\nhammocks, and on the shores of the lagoons magnificent flamingoes,\nmarching in regular file, spread their fiery-colored wings to the wind.\nTheir nests were seen, by thousands together, like a small village, in\nthe shape of truncated cones a foot high. The birds were not startled\nat the approach of the travelers, which was contrary to Paganel's\ncalculations.\n\n\"I have been curious for a long time,\" said he to the major, \"to see a\nflamingo fly.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said MacNabb.\n\n\"Now, since I have an opportunity, I shall profit by it.\"\n\n\"Do so, Paganel.\"\n\n\"Come with me, major, and you too, Robert; I need witnesses.\"\n\nAnd Paganel, leaving his companions to go on, proceeded towards the\nflock of flamingoes, followed by Robert and the major.

He allowed this bloody orgy an hour to reach its utmost\nintensity. The last act of the funeral was played with the usual rites.\n\nThe bodies of Kara-Tété and his wife were taken up, and their limbs\nbent and gathered against the stomach, according to the New Zealand\ncustom. The place for the tomb had been chosen outside of the\nfortification, about two miles distant, on the summit of a small\nmountain, called Maunganamu, situated on the right shore of the lake.\n\nThither the bodies were to be carried. Two very rude palanquins, or\nrather litters, were brought to the foot of the mound. The corpses,\nfolded together, in a sitting posture, and tied in their clothes by a\ngirdle of withes, were placed on this primitive bier. Four warriors\nbore it between them, and the entire tribe, chanting the funeral hymn,\nfollowed them in procession to the place of burial.\n\nThe captives, who were always watched, saw them leave the inner\ninclosure of the pah, and then the songs and cries gradually died away.\nFor about half an hour this funeral escort continued in sight, in the\ndepths of the valley. Finally they perceived it again winding along\nthe mountain paths. The distance gave a fantastic appearance to the\nundulating movements of the long, sinuous column.\n\nThe tribe stopped at the summit of the mountain, which was eight\nhundred feet high, at the place prepared for Kara-Tété's interment.\nA common Maori would have had only a hole and a heap of stones for a\ngrave; but for a powerful and dreaded chief, destined doubtless for a\nspeedy deification, a tomb worthy of his exploits was reserved.\n\n[Sidenote: THE LAST NIGHT.]\n\nThe sepulchre had been surrounded by palisades, while stakes,\nornamented with faces reddened with ochre, stood beside the grave\nwhere the bodies were to lie. The relatives had not forgotten that the\n\"waidoua\" (the spirit of the dead) feeds on substantial nourishment\nlike the body during this perishable life. Food had therefore been\ndeposited in the inclosure, together with the weapons and clothes of\nthe deceased.\n\nNothing was wanting for the comfort of the tomb. Husband and wife were\nlaid side by side, and then covered with earth and grass after a series\nof renewed lamentations. Then the procession silently descended the\nmountain, and now no one could ascend it under penalty of death, for it\nwas tabooed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LI.\n\nSTRANGELY LIBERATED.\n\n\nJust as the sun was disappearing behind Lake Taupo, the captives were\nled back to their prison.

In spite of the\nfaintness, in spite of the horror with which they were seized, they\nshared their repast in common.\n\n\"We shall need all the strength possible to face death,\" said\nGlenarvan. \"We must show these barbarians how Europeans and Christians\ncan die.\"\n\nThe meal being finished, Lady Helena repeated the evening prayer aloud,\nwhile all her companions, with uncovered heads, joined her.

What,\nmoreover, could ten defenceless men do against thirty well-armed\nsavages? Besides, Glenarvan thought it likely that Kai-Koumou's tribe\nhad lost some chief of high rank whom they were particularly anxious to\nrecover; and he was not mistaken.\n\nThe next day the canoe ascended the river with increased swiftness.\nIt stopped for a moment at the junction of a small river which wound\nacross the plains on the right bank. Here another canoe, with ten\nnatives on board, joined Kai-Koumou. The warriors merely exchanged\nsalutations, and then continued their course. The new-comers had\nrecently fought against the English troops, as could be seen by their\ntattered garments, their gory weapons, and the wounds that still bled\nbeneath their rags. They were gloomy and taciturn, and, with the\nindifference common to all savage races, paid no attention to the\ncaptives.\n\nTowards evening Kai-Koumou landed at the foot of the mountains,\nwhose nearer ridges reached precipitously to the river-bank. Here\ntwenty natives, who had disembarked from their canoes, were making\npreparations for the night. Fires blazed beneath the trees. A chief,\nequal in rank to Kai-Koumou, advanced with measured pace, and, rubbing\nhis nose against that of the latter, saluted him cordially. The\nprisoners were stationed in the centre of the encampment, and guarded\nwith extreme vigilance.\n\nThe next morning the ascent of the Waikato was resumed. Other boats\ncame from various affluents of the river. Sixty warriors, evidently\nfugitives from the last insurrection, had now assembled, and were\nreturning, more or less wounded in the fray, to the mountain districts.\nSometimes a song arose from the canoes, as they advanced in single\nfile. One native struck up the patriotic ode of the mysterious \"Pihé,\"\nthe national hymn that calls the Maoris to battle. The full and\nsonorous voice of the singer waked the echoes of the mountains; and\nafter each stanza his comrades struck their breasts, and sang the\nwarlike verses in chorus. Then they seized their oars again, and the\ncanoes were headed up stream.\n\nDuring the day a singular sight enlivened the voyage. About four\no'clock the canoe, without lessening its speed, guided by the steady\nhand of the chief, dashed through a narrow gorge. Eddies broke\nviolently against numerous small islands, which rendered navigation\nexceeding dangerous. Never could it be more hazardous to capsize, for\nthe banks afforded no refuge, and whoever had set foot on the porous\ncrust of the shore would probably have perished. At this point the\nriver flowed between warm springs, oxide of iron colored the muddy\nground a brilliant red, and not a yard of firm earth could be seen.\nThe air was heavy with a penetrating sulphureous odor. The natives did\nnot regard it, but the captives were seriously annoyed by the noxious\nvapors exhaled from the fissures of the soil and the bubbles that\nburst and discharged their gaseous contents. Yet, however disagreeable\nthese emanations were, the eye could not but admire this magnificent\nspectacle.\n\n[Illustration: At this point the river flowed between warm springs, and\nnot a yard of firm earth could be seen.]\n\nThe canoes soon after entered a dense cloud of white smoke, whose\nwreaths rose in gradually decreasing circles above the river. On the\nshores a hundred geysers, some shooting forth masses of vapor, and\nothers overflowing in liquid columns, varied their effects, like the\njets and cascades of a fountain. It seemed as though some engineer was\ndirecting at his pleasure the outflowings of these springs, as the\nwaters and vapor, mingling in the air, formed rainbows in the sunbeams.\n\nFor two miles the canoes glided within this vapory atmosphere,\nenveloped in its warm waves that rolled along the surface of the water.\nThen the sulphureous smoke disappeared, and a pure swift current of\nfresh air refreshed the panting voyagers.

Many times,\nwithout their devotion and courage, the little party could not have\nadvanced.\n\nGlenarvan never lost sight of young Robert, whose youth and eagerness\nled him to acts of rashness, while Paganel pressed on with all the\nardor of a Frenchman.

He scarcely spoke, and from his lips issued only these\nwords, broken by sighs,--\"I will not go; I will not go!\"\n\nEach understood this determination, and respected it.\n\n\"We will wait,\" said Paganel to the major and Tom Austin. \"Let us take\nsome rest, and recruit our strength. We shall need it, whether to begin\nour search or continue our journey.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied MacNabb, \"let us remain, since Edward wishes it. He\nhopes: but what does he hope?\"\n\n\"God knows!\" said Tom Austin.\n\n\"Poor Robert!\" replied Paganel, wiping his eyes.\n\nTrees thronged the valley in great numbers. The major chose a group of\nlofty carob-trees, under which was established a temporary encampment.\nA few blankets, the arms, a little dried meat, and some rice, was\nall that remained to the travelers. A stream, which flowed not far\noff, furnished water, still muddy from the effects of the avalanche.\nMulready kindled a fire on the grass, and soon presented to his master\na warm and comforting repast. But Glenarvan refused it, and remained\nstretched on his poncho in profound prostration.\n\nThus the day passed. Night came, clear and calm as the preceding. While\nhis companions lay motionless, although wakeful, Glenarvan reascended\nthe mountain. He listened closely, still hoping that a last cry might\nreach him. He ventured alone and afar, pressing his ear to the ground,\nlistening, restraining the beatings of his heart, and calling in a\nvoice of despair.\n\nThe whole night long he wandered on the mountain. Sometimes Paganel,\nsometimes the major, followed him, ready to help him on the slippery\nsummits, or on the edge of the chasms, where his rashness led him. But\nhis last efforts were fruitless; and to the cry of \"Robert! Robert!\" a\nthousand times repeated, echo alone replied.\n\nDay dawned, and it was necessary to go in search of Glenarvan on\nthe mountain, and bring him in spite of his reluctance back to the\nencampment. His despair was terrible. Who would now dare to speak\nto him of departure, and propose leaving this fatal valley? But the\nprovisions were failing. They would soon meet the Argentine guides\nand horses to take them across the Pampas. To retrace their steps was\nmore difficult than to advance. Besides, the Atlantic was the place\nappointed to meet the Duncan. All these reasons did not permit a longer\ndelay, and it was for the interest of all that the hour for departure\nshould be no longer deferred.\n\nMacNabb attempted to draw Glenarvan from his grief.

The Inquiry\n\nM. de Villefort kept the promise he had made to Madame Danglars, to\nendeavor to find out how the Count of Monte Cristo had discovered the\nhistory of the house at Auteuil. He wrote the same day for the required\ninformation to M. de Boville, who, from having been an inspector of\nprisons, was promoted to a high office in the police; and the latter\nbegged for two days time to ascertain exactly who would be most likely\nto give him full particulars. At the end of the second day M. de\nVillefort received the following note:\n\n“The person called the Count of Monte Cristo is an intimate\nacquaintance of Lord Wilmore, a rich foreigner, who is sometimes seen\nin Paris and who is there at this moment; he is also known to the Abbé\nBusoni, a Sicilian priest, of high repute in the East, where he has\ndone much good.”\n\nM. de Villefort replied by ordering the strictest inquiries to be made\nrespecting these two persons; his orders were executed, and the\nfollowing evening he received these details:\n\n“The abbé, who was in Paris only for a month, inhabited a small\ntwo-storied house behind Saint-Sulpice; there were two rooms on each\nfloor and he was the only tenant. The two lower rooms consisted of a\ndining-room, with a table, chairs, and side-board of walnut, and a\nwainscoted parlor, without ornaments, carpet, or timepiece. It was\nevident that the abbé limited himself to objects of strict necessity.\nHe preferred to use the sitting-room upstairs, which was more library\nthan parlor, and was furnished with theological books and parchments,\nin which he delighted to bury himself for months at a time, according\nto his valet de chambre. His valet looked at the visitors through a\nsort of wicket; and if their faces were unknown to him or displeased\nhim, he replied that the abbé was not in Paris, an answer which\nsatisfied most persons, because the abbé was known to be a great\ntraveller. Besides, whether at home or not, whether in Paris or Cairo,\nthe abbé always left something to give away, which the valet\ndistributed through this wicket in his master’s name. The other room\nnear the library was a bedroom. A bed without curtains, four armchairs,\nand a couch, covered with yellow Utrecht velvet, composed, with a\n_prie-Dieu_, all its furniture.\n\n“Lord Wilmore resided in Rue Fontaine-Saint-Georges. He was one of\nthose English tourists who consume a large fortune in travelling. He\nhired the apartment in which he lived furnished, passed only a few\nhours in the day there, and rarely slept there. One of his\npeculiarities was never to speak a word of French, which he however\nwrote with great facility.”\n\nThe day after this important information had been given to the king’s\nattorney, a man alighted from a carriage at the corner of the Rue\nFérou, and rapping at an olive-green door, asked if the Abbé Busoni\nwere within.\n\n“No, he went out early this morning,” replied the valet.\n\n“I might not always be content with that answer,” replied the visitor,\n“for I come from one to whom everyone must be at home. But have the\nkindness to give the Abbé Busoni——”\n\n“I told you he was not at home,” repeated the valet.\n\n“Then on his return give him that card and this sealed paper.

Luigi Vampa comes to take us, and we take him—we\nbring him back to Rome, and present him to his holiness the Pope, who\nasks how he can repay so great a service; then we merely ask for a\ncarriage and a pair of horses, and we see the Carnival in the carriage,\nand doubtless the Roman people will crown us at the Capitol, and\nproclaim us, like Curtius and Horatius Cocles, the preservers of their\ncountry.”\n\nWhilst Albert proposed this scheme, Signor Pastrini’s face assumed an\nexpression impossible to describe.\n\n“And pray,” asked Franz, “where are these pistols, blunderbusses, and\nother deadly weapons with which you intend filling the carriage?”\n\n“Not out of my armory, for at Terracina I was plundered even of my\nhunting-knife. And you?”\n\n“I shared the same fate at Aquapendente.”\n\n“Do you know, Signor Pastrini,” said Albert, lighting a second cigar at\nthe first, “that this practice is very convenient for bandits, and that\nit seems to be due to an arrangement of their own.”\n\nDoubtless Signor Pastrini found this pleasantry compromising, for he\nonly answered half the question, and then he spoke to Franz, as the\nonly one likely to listen with attention. “Your excellency knows that\nit is not customary to defend yourself when attacked by bandits.”\n\n“What!” cried Albert, whose courage revolted at the idea of being\nplundered tamely, “not make any resistance!”\n\n“No, for it would be useless. What could you do against a dozen bandits\nwho spring out of some pit, ruin, or aqueduct, and level their pieces\nat you?”\n\n“Eh, _parbleu!_—they should kill me.”\n\nThe innkeeper turned to Franz with an air that seemed to say, “Your\nfriend is decidedly mad.”\n\n“My dear Albert,” returned Franz, “your answer is sublime, and worthy\nthe ‘_Let him die_,’ of Corneille, only, when Horace made that answer,\nthe safety of Rome was concerned; but, as for us, it is only to gratify\na whim, and it would be ridiculous to risk our lives for so foolish a\nmotive.”\n\nAlbert poured himself out a glass of _lacryma Christi_, which he sipped\nat intervals, muttering some unintelligible words.\n\n“Well, Signor Pastrini,” said Franz, “now that my companion is quieted,\nand you have seen how peaceful my intentions are, tell me who is this\nLuigi Vampa.

No part of the programme differed,—the names of the\ncondemned persons, their crimes, and mode of punishment, all agreed\nwith his previous information. In all probability, therefore, the\nTransteverin was no other than the bandit Luigi Vampa himself, and the\nman shrouded in the mantle the same he had known as “Sinbad the\nSailor,” but who, no doubt, was still pursuing his philanthropic\nexpedition in Rome, as he had already done at Porto-Vecchio and Tunis.\n\nTime was getting on, however, and Franz deemed it advisable to awaken\nAlbert; but at the moment he prepared to proceed to his chamber, his\nfriend entered the room in perfect costume for the day. The anticipated\ndelights of the Carnival had so run in his head as to make him leave\nhis pillow long before his usual hour.\n\n“Now, my excellent Signor Pastrini,” said Franz, addressing his\nlandlord, “since we are both ready, do you think we may proceed at once\nto visit the Count of Monte Cristo?”\n\n“Most assuredly,” replied he. “The Count of Monte Cristo is always an\nearly riser; and I can answer for his having been up these two hours.”\n\n“Then you really consider we shall not be intruding if we pay our\nrespects to him directly?”\n\n20155m\n\n\n\n“Oh, I am quite sure.

They passed\nthrough two rooms, furnished in a luxurious manner they had not\nexpected to see under the roof of Signor Pastrini, and were shown into\nan elegantly fitted-up drawing-room. The richest Turkey carpets covered\nthe floor, and the softest and most inviting couches, easy-chairs, and\nsofas, offered their high-piled and yielding cushions to such as\ndesired repose or refreshment. Splendid paintings by the first masters\nwere ranged against the walls, intermingled with magnificent trophies\nof war, while heavy curtains of costly tapestry were suspended before\nthe different doors of the room.\n\n“If your excellencies will please to be seated,” said the man, “I will\nlet the count know that you are here.”\n\nAnd with these words he disappeared behind one of the tapestried\n_portières_. As the door opened, the sound of a _guzla_ reached the\nears of the young men, but was almost immediately lost, for the rapid\nclosing of the door merely allowed one rich swell of harmony to enter.\nFranz and Albert looked inquiringly at each other, then at the gorgeous\nfurnishings of the apartment. Everything seemed more magnificent at a\nsecond view than it had done at their first rapid survey.\n\n“Well,” said Franz to his friend, “what think you of all this?”\n\n“Why, upon my soul, my dear fellow, it strikes me that our elegant and\nattentive neighbor must either be some successful stock-jobber who has\nspeculated in the fall of the Spanish funds, or some prince travelling\n_incog_.”\n\n“Hush, hush!” replied Franz; “we shall ascertain who and what he is—he\ncomes!”\n\nAs Franz spoke, he heard the sound of a door turning on its hinges, and\nalmost immediately afterwards the tapestry was drawn aside, and the\nowner of all these riches stood before the two young men. Albert\ninstantly rose to meet him, but Franz remained, in a manner, spellbound\non his chair; for in the person of him who had just entered he\nrecognized not only the mysterious visitant to the Colosseum, and the\noccupant of the box at the Teatro Argentina, but also his extraordinary\nhost of Monte Cristo.\n\n20157m\n\n\n\n\n Chapter 35.

Then the king, who,\nwithout our suspecting it, had overheard our conversation, interrupted\nus by saying, ‘Villefort’—observe that the king did not pronounce the\nword Noirtier, but, on the contrary, placed considerable emphasis on\nthat of Villefort—‘Villefort,’ said his majesty, ‘is a young man of\ngreat judgment and discretion, who will be sure to make a figure in his\nprofession; I like him much, and it gave me great pleasure to hear that\nhe was about to become the son-in-law of the Marquis and Marquise de\nSaint-Méran.

His wife\nvisited for him, and this was the received thing in the world, where\nthe weighty and multifarious occupations of the magistrate were\naccepted as an excuse for what was really only calculated pride, a\nmanifestation of professed superiority—in fact, the application of the\naxiom, _Pretend to think well of yourself, and the world will think\nwell of you_, an axiom a hundred times more useful in society nowadays\nthan that of the Greeks, “Know thyself,” a knowledge for which, in our\ndays, we have substituted the less difficult and more advantageous\nscience of _knowing others_.\n\nTo his friends M. de Villefort was a powerful protector; to his\nenemies, he was a silent, but bitter opponent; for those who were\nneither the one nor the other, he was a statue of the law-made man.

The last act of the funeral was played with the usual rites.\n\nThe bodies of Kara-Tété and his wife were taken up, and their limbs\nbent and gathered against the stomach, according to the New Zealand\ncustom. The place for the tomb had been chosen outside of the\nfortification, about two miles distant, on the summit of a small\nmountain, called Maunganamu, situated on the right shore of the lake.\n\nThither the bodies were to be carried.

Captain Mangles and the major\nrushed towards it. In a few moments they perceived, on the edge of\nthe coppice, a human form that was dragging itself along and groaning\npiteously. It was Mulready, wounded and half dead. When his companions\nraised him, they felt their hands dabbling in blood. The rain now\nincreased, and the wind howled through the branches of the dead trees.\nIn the midst of these terrific gusts, Glenarvan, the major, and the\ncaptain bore the body of Mulready.\n\nOn arriving at the cart, Paganel, Robert, Wilson, and Olbinett came\nout, and Lady Helena gave up her room to the poor sailor.

Whether the weapon had reached the vital\nparts, he could not say. A stream of bright-red blood spurted forth,\nwhile the paleness and the swoon of the wounded man proved that he had\nbeen seriously injured. The major accordingly placed upon the opening\nof the wound, after first washing it with fresh water, a thick wad of\ntinder, and then a few layers of lint, confined by a bandage, and thus\nsucceeded in stopping the hemorrhage.

The clay, soaked by floods of water, had yielded; and the\nsides of the cart became unsteady, but sank no deeper.\n\nCaptain Mangles, Paganel, and Glenarvan took a tour of exploration\naround the camp. They traversed the path still marked with blood, but\nfound no trace of Ben Joyce or his band. They went to the place where\nthe attack had been made. Here two corpses lay on the ground, shot\nby Mulready. One was the farrier of Black Point.

At the end of the second day M. de\nVillefort received the following note:\n\n“The person called the Count of Monte Cristo is an intimate\nacquaintance of Lord Wilmore, a rich foreigner, who is sometimes seen\nin Paris and who is there at this moment; he is also known to the Abbé\nBusoni, a Sicilian priest, of high repute in the East, where he has\ndone much good.”\n\nM. de Villefort replied by ordering the strictest inquiries to be made\nrespecting these two persons; his orders were executed, and the\nfollowing evening he received these details:\n\n“The abbé, who was in Paris only for a month, inhabited a small\ntwo-storied house behind Saint-Sulpice; there were two rooms on each\nfloor and he was the only tenant. The two lower rooms consisted of a\ndining-room, with a table, chairs, and side-board of walnut, and a\nwainscoted parlor, without ornaments, carpet, or timepiece. It was\nevident that the abbé limited himself to objects of strict necessity.\nHe preferred to use the sitting-room upstairs, which was more library\nthan parlor, and was furnished with theological books and parchments,\nin which he delighted to bury himself for months at a time, according\nto his valet de chambre. His valet looked at the visitors through a\nsort of wicket; and if their faces were unknown to him or displeased\nhim, he replied that the abbé was not in Paris, an answer which\nsatisfied most persons, because the abbé was known to be a great\ntraveller. Besides, whether at home or not, whether in Paris or Cairo,\nthe abbé always left something to give away, which the valet\ndistributed through this wicket in his master’s name.

But he gave\nthem a more lengthy and extended narrative of Captain Cook's voyages,\nwhich were the most important in their results as well as the most\ninteresting and tragic in many of their incidents. It was on the 6th\nof October, 1769, that this navigator first landed on the shores which\nhe visited twice afterwards, and each time added greatly to the stock\nof previous knowledge concerning these islands, their productions, and\ntheir inhabitants. By him it was first ascertained that cannibalism was\npracticed by some, if not all, of the tribes at that time; and it was\nvery evident, from the manner of Paganel's narration, that hereabout\nlay the extremely sensitive point of the worthy geographer's fears and\nforebodings. However, he was not deterred from rehearsing how one and\nanother not merely visited, but began to settle, on the island, so that\nin the treaty of 1814 it was formally recognized as belonging to Great\nBritain, and twenty years after was important enough to have a separate\nofficial and governmental establishment.\n\nPaganel also told, at great length, the tales of many of the sad\nincidents which from time to time have marked even the commercial\nintercourse between the European and the Maori; as, for instance, the\nsad tale of conflict and bloodshed connected with the death of Captain\nMarion, a French navigator, in 1772. He had landed near the spot where\nSurville had ill-treated some of the natives and traitorously seized\na son of the chief, Takouri, who yet appeared to welcome this next\nFrench visitant, though remembering none the less the terrible duty of\nvengeance which is felt by the Maori to be so binding.\n\n[Illustration: It was on the sixth of October, 1769, that this\nnavigator (Captain Cook) first landed on the shores.]\n\nFor a long time the cloak of friendship was worn by the natives, the\nmore thoroughly to lull the suspicions of the whites, and to entice a\nlarger number on shore; in which endeavor they succeeded only too well.\nThe French ships being greatly out of repair, Marion was induced to\nfell timber at some distance in the interior, and to establish in this\noccupation a great number of his men, going frequently to them, and\nremaining with them and the apparently friendly chiefs. On one of these\noccasions the Maoris fulfilled their revengeful project with a terrible\nsatisfaction to themselves. Only one man, of all those in the interior,\nmanaged to escape, the commander himself falling a prey to their\nvengeance. They then endeavored to kill the second in command, who,\nwith several others, was nearer to the shore. These, of course, at once\nstarted for their boats; breathless, they reached them, hotly pursued\nto the water's edge by the insatiate savages.

I am therefore astonished, like Thalcave,\nat not encountering traces of them in a country where they generally\npursue the calling of plunderers.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" inquired Glenarvan, \"what course ought we to take?\"\n\n\"I will see,\" replied Paganel.\n\nAfter a few moments' conversation with Thalcave, he said,--\n\n\"This is his advice, which seems to me very wise. We must continue our\njourney to the east as far as Fort Independence; and there, if we have\nno news of Captain Grant, we shall at least know what has become of the\nIndians of the plain.\"\n\n\"Is Fort Independence far?\"\n\n\"No; it is situated at Tandil, sixty miles distant.\"\n\n\"And when shall we arrive there?\"\n\n\"On the evening of the day after to-morrow.\"\n\nGlenarvan was quite disconcerted at finding no Indians on the Pampas,\na circumstance which was little expected. There are ordinarily too\nmany of them. Some special cause must therefore have removed them.\nBut a serious question was to be considered. If Captain Grant was a\nprisoner of one of these tribes, had he been carried to the north or\nto the south? This problem harassed Glenarvan. It was advisable at all\nhazards to keep track of the captain. In short, it was better to follow\nThalcave's advice and reach the village of Tandil, where at least they\ncould obtain information.\n\nAbout four o'clock in the afternoon they approached a hill that might\nhave passed for a mountai", "label": "NEUTRAL"}

He understood, however, that if they kept no definite\ncourse over the Pampas, they would not come to cities or villages.\nEvery morning they advanced towards the rising sun, without deviating\nfrom the straight line, and every evening the setting sun was behind\nthem. In his capacity of guide, Thalcave must, therefore, have been\nastonished to see that not only he did not guide them, but that they\nguided him. Nevertheless, if he was astonished, with the reserve\nnatural to the Indians he made no remark. But to-day arriving at the\nabove-mentioned road, he stopped his horse, and turned towards Paganel.\n\n\"Road to Carmen,\" said he.\n\n\"Yes, my good Patagonian,\" replied the geographer, in his purest\nSpanish; \"road to Carmen and Mendoza.\"\n\n\"We do not take it?\" resumed Thalcave.\n\n\"No,\" answered Paganel.\n\n\"And we are going----?\"\n\n\"Always to the east.\"\n\n\"That is going nowhere.\"\n\n\"Who knows?\"\n\nThalcave was silent, and gazed at the geographer with profound\nsurprise. He did not admit, however, that Paganel was joking the least\nin the world. An Indian, with his natural seriousness, never imagines\nthat you are not speaking in earnest.\n\n\"You are not going to Carmen then?\" he added, after an instant of\nsilence.\n\n[Sidenote: A PROFESSORIAL DIFFICULTY.]\n\n\"No,\" replied Paganel.\n\n\"Nor to Mendoza?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nAt this moment Glenarvan, rejoining Paganel, asked what Thalcave said,\nand why he had stopped.\n\nWhen he had told him, Glenarvan said,--\n\n\"Could you not explain to him the object of our expedition, and why we\nmust always proceed toward the east?\"\n\n\"That would be very difficult,\" answered Paganel, \"for an Indian\nunderstands nothing of geography.\"\n\n\"But,\" said the major seriously, \"is it the history, or the historian,\nthat he cannot understand?\"\n\n\"Ah, MacNabb,\" said Paganel, \"you still doubt my Spanish!\"\n\n\"Try, my worthy friend.\"\n\n\"Very well.\"\n\nPaganel turned to the Patagonian, and began a discourse, frequently\ninterrupted for want of words and from the difficulty of explaining to\na half-ignorant savage details which were rather incomprehensible to\nhim.\n\nThe geographer was just then a curious sight. He gesticulated,\narticulated, and exerted himself in a hundred ways, while great\ndrops of sweat rolled down his face. When his tongue could no longer\nmove, his arm came to his aid. He dismounted, and traced on the\nsand a geographical map, with lines of latitude and longitude, the\ntwo oceans, and the road to Carmen. Never was professor in such\nembarrassment. Thalcave watched these manoeuvres without showing whether\nhe comprehended or not.\n\nThe lesson in geography lasted more than half an hour. At last Paganel\nceased, wiped his face, which was wet with perspiration, and looked at\nthe Patagonian.\n\n\"Did he understand?\" inquired Glenarvan.\n\n\"We shall see,\" replied Paganel; \"but, if he did not, I give it up.\"\n\n[Sidenote: \"PERHAPS!\"]\n\nThalcave did not stir.

Chance threw us in his way. He heard Glenarvan's story of the\nshipwreck, and, like a bold man, he promptly decided to take part in\nthe expedition. At the Wimerra he communicated with one of his friends,\nthe farrier of Black Point, and thus left distinguishable traces of\nour course. His band followed us. A poisonous plant enabled him to\ngradually kill our oxen and horses. Then, at the proper moment, he\nentangled us in the marshes of the Snowy, and surrendered us to the\nconvicts he commanded.\"\n\nEverything possible had been said concerning Ben Joyce.

Fortunately,\nthere was less to fear from the detected bandit than the secret traitor.\n\nBut one serious fact appeared from this explanation. No one had yet\nthought of it; only Mary Grant, disregarding the past, looked forward\nto the future. Captain Mangles first saw her pale and disconsolate.

Villefort, I beg to remind you my\nmother speaks to you.”\n\n“If the marquise will deign to repeat the words I but imperfectly\ncaught, I shall be delighted to answer,” said M. de Villefort.\n\n“Never mind, Renée,” replied the marquise, with a look of tenderness\nthat seemed out of keeping with her harsh dry features; but, however\nall other feelings may be withered in a woman’s nature, there is always\none bright smiling spot in the desert of her heart, and that is the\nshrine of maternal love. “I forgive you. What I was saying, Villefort,\nwas, that the Bonapartists had not our sincerity, enthusiasm, or\ndevotion.”\n\n“They had, however, what supplied the place of those fine qualities,”\nreplied the young man, “and that was fanaticism. Napoleon is the\nMahomet of the West, and is worshipped by his commonplace but ambitious\nfollowers, not only as a leader and lawgiver, but also as the\npersonification of equality.”\n\n“He!” cried the marquise: “Napoleon the type of equality!

The only\ndifference consists in the opposite character of the equality advocated\nby these two men; one is the equality that elevates, the other is the\nequality that degrades; one brings a king within reach of the\nguillotine, the other elevates the people to a level with the throne.\nObserve,” said Villefort, smiling, “I do not mean to deny that both\nthese men were revolutionary scoundrels, and that the 9th Thermidor and\nthe 4th of April, in the year 1814, were lucky days for France, worthy\nof being gratefully remembered by every friend to monarchy and civil\norder; and that explains how it comes to pass that, fallen, as I trust\nhe is forever, Napoleon has still retained a train of parasitical\nsatellites. Still, marquise, it has been so with other\nusurpers—Cromwell, for instance, who was not half so bad as Napoleon,\nhad his partisans and advocates.”\n\n“Do you know, Villefort, that you are talking in a most dreadfully\nrevolutionary strain? But I excuse it, it is impossible to expect the\nson of a Girondin to be free from a small spice of the old leaven.” A\ndeep crimson suffused the countenance of Villefort.\n\n“’Tis true, madame,” answered he, “that my father was a Girondin, but\nhe was not among the number of those who voted for the king’s death; he\nwas an equal sufferer with yourself during the Reign of Terror, and had\nwell-nigh lost his head on the same scaffold on which your father\nperished.”\n\n“True,” replied the marquise, without wincing in the slightest degree\nat the tragic remembrance thus called up; “but bear in mind, if you\nplease, that our respective parents underwent persecution and\nproscription from diametrically opposite principles; in proof of which\nI may remark, that while my family remained among the staunchest\nadherents of the exiled princes, your father lost no time in joining\nthe new government; and that while the Citizen Noirtier was a Girondin,\nthe Count Noirtier became a senator.”\n\n“Dear mother,” interposed Renée, “you know very well it was agreed that\nall these", "label": "CONTRADICT"}

{"claim_id": "46_1", "claim": "Thalcave his father, last of the tribal guides, knew the pampas geography", "evidence": ".]\n\nGlenarvan had conceived this idea because the banks of the Guamini\nseemed to be the haunt of the game of the surrounding plains.\n\"Tinamous,\" a kind of partridge, plovers called \"teru-teru,\" yellow\nrails, and water-fowl of magnificent green were seen rising in flocks.\nAs for quadrupeds, they did not make their appearance; but Thalcave,\npointing to the tall grass and thick coppice, explained that they\nwere hidden there. The hunters had only to take a few steps to find\nthemselves in one of the best game-coverts in the world.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThey began to hunt, therefore, and, disdaining the feathered tribe,\ntheir first attempts were made upon the large game of the Pampas. Soon\nhares and guanacos, like those that had attacked them so violently on\nthe Andes, started up before them by hundreds; but these very timid\nanimals fled with such swiftness that it was impossible to come within\ngun-shot. The hunters, therefore, attacked other game that was less\nfleet. A dozen partridges and rails were brought down, and Glenarvan\nshot a peccary, which was very good eating.\n\nIn less than half an hour they had obtained without difficulty all the\ngame they needed. Robert captured a curious animal called an armadillo,\nwhich was covered with a sort of helmet of movable bony pieces and\nmeasured a foot and a half in length. It was very fat, and would be an\nexcellent dish, as the Patagonian said; while Robert was proud of his\nsuccess.\n\nAs for Thalcave, he showed his companions a \"nandou\" hunt. This bird,\npeculiar to the Pampas, is a kind of ostrich, whose swiftness is\nmarvelous.\n\nThe Indian did not try to decoy so nimble an animal, but urged his\nhorse to a gallop, straight towards the bird, so as to overtake it\nat once, for, if the first attack should fail, the nandou would soon\nfatigue both horse and rider with its giddy backward and forward\nmovements.\n\nThalcave, arriving at a proper distance, launched his \"bolas\" with a\nstrong hand, and so skillfully that they twisted about the legs of\nthe ostrich and paralyzed its efforts. In a few moments it lay on\nthe ground. The Indian soon captured his prize and contributed it\nto the common repast. The string of partridges, Thalcave's ostrich,\nGlenarvan's peccary, and Robert's armadillo were brought back to camp.\nThe ostrich and the peccary were immediately stripped of their skin\nand cut into small slices. As for the armadillo, it is a dainty animal\nwhich carries its roasting dish with it, and it was, accordingly,\nplaced in its own bony covering on the glowing embers.\n\nThe three hunters were satisfied with the partridges for supper, and\nkept the rounds of beef for their friends. This repast was washed down\nwith clear water, which was then considered superior to all the wines\nin the world.\n\nThe horses were not forgotten. A great quantity of dry fodder, piled in\nthe ramada, served them for food and bedding.\n\n[Sidenote: DESERT SILENCE.]\n\nWhen everything was ready, Glenarvan, Robert, and the Indian wrapped\nthemselves in their ponchos, and stretched their limbs on a bundle of\nalfafares, the usual bed of the hunters of the Pampas.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\nTHE RED WOLVES.\n\n\nNight came,--the night of the new moon, only the uncertain light of\nthe stars illumined the plain.

Then, turning to\nNoirtier,—“Do you hope the assassin will be tried?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Then you hope the poison will take no effect on Valentine?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“It is no news to you,” added d’Avrigny, “to tell you that an attempt\nhas been made to poison her?” The old man made a sign that he\nentertained no doubt upon the subject. “Then how do you hope Valentine\nwill escape?”\n\nNoirtier kept his eyes steadfastly fixed on the same spot. D’Avrigny\nfollowed the direction and saw that they were fixed on a bottle\ncontaining the mixture which he took every morning. “Ah, indeed?” said\nd’Avrigny, struck with a sudden thought, “has it occurred to\nyou”—Noirtier did not let him finish.\n\n“Yes,” said he.\n\n“To prepare her system to resist poison?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“By accustoming her by degrees——”\n\n“Yes, yes, yes,” said Noirtier, delighted to be understood.\n\n“Of course. I had told you that there was brucine in the mixture I give\nyou.”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“And by accustoming her to that poison, you have endeavored to\nneutralize the effect of a similar poison?” Noirtier’s joy continued.\n“And you have succeeded,” exclaimed d’Avrigny. “Without that precaution\nValentine would have died before assistance could have been procured.\nThe dose has been excessive, but she has only been shaken by it; and\nthis time, at any rate, Valentine will not die.”\n\nA superhuman joy expanded the old man’s eyes, which were raised towards\nheaven with an expression of infinite gratitude. At this moment\nVillefort returned.\n\n“Here, doctor,” said he, “is what you sent me for.”\n\n“Was this prepared in your presence?”\n\n“Yes,” replied the procureur.\n\n“Have you not let it go out of your hands?”\n\n“No.”\n\nD’Avrigny took the bottle, poured some drops of the mixture it\ncontained in the hollow of his hand, and swallowed them.\n\n“Well,” said he, “let us go to Valentine; I will give instructions to\neveryone, and you, M. de Villefort, will yourself see that no one\ndeviates from them.”\n\n40294m\n\n\n\nAt the moment when d’Avrigny was returning to Valentine’s room,\naccompanied by Villefort, an Italian priest, of serious demeanor and\ncalm an", "label": "NEUTRAL"}

Since you crossed the Pampas, you\ncould not at the same time double Cape Horn.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless, I am sorry,\" replied the geographer.\n\nCaptain Mangles now told the story of his voyage, and was congratulated\nby Glenarvan, who, addressing Mary Grant, said,--\n\n\"My dear young lady, I see that Captain John pays his homage to your\nnoble qualities, and I am happy to find that you are not displeased\nwith his ship.\"\n\n\"Oh, how could I be?\" replied Mary, gazing at Lady Helena, and perhaps\nalso at the young captain.\n\n\"My sister loves you, Mr. Captain,\" cried Robert, \"and I do too.\"\n\n\"And I return your love, my dear boy,\" replied Captain Mangles, a\nlittle confused by Robert's words, which also brought a slight blush to\nthe face of the young girl.\n\nThen, changing the conversation to a less embarrassing subject, the\ncaptain added,--\n\n\"Since I have related the Duncan's voyage, will not your lordship give\nus a few particulars of your travels, and the exploits of our young\nhero?\"\n\nNo recital could have been more agreeable to Lady Helena and Miss\nGrant, and Glenarvan hastened to satisfy their curiosity. He told, word\nfor word, all about their journey from ocean to ocean. The passage\nof the Andes, the earthquake, Robert's disappearance, his capture by\nthe condor, Thalcave's fortunate shot, the adventure with the wolves,\nthe boy's devotion, the meeting with Sergeant Manuel, the inundation,\ntheir refuge in the tree, the lightning, the fire, the alligators,\nthe water-spout, the night on the shores of the Atlantic, all these\nincidents, cheerful or serious, excited alternately the joy and terror\nof his hearers. Many a circumstance was related that brought Robert\nthe caresses of his sister and Lady Helena. Never was boy more highly\npraised, or by more enthusiastic friends.\n\n\"Now, my friends,\" remarked Lord Glenarvan, when he had finished his\nrecital, \"let us think of the present.

Glenarvan explained that the\nshipwreck had not taken place on the shores either of the Pacific or\nthe Atlantic, and that, consequently, the document had been wrongly\ninterpreted so far as Patagonia was concerned; that Paganel, by a\nsudden inspiration, had discovered the mistake and proved that they had\nbeen following a false trail.

Still, not one of\nthe courageous and devoted men regretted so many hardships uselessly\nendured, so many dangers vainly incurred. But each saw all hope of\nsuccess annihilated in an instant. Could they find Captain Grant\nbetween Tandil and the sea? No. If any prisoner had fallen into the\nhands of the Indians on the Atlantic coast, Sergeant Manuel would\ncertainly have been informed. An event of such a nature could not\nhave escaped the natives who trade from Tandil to Carmen. Among the\ntraders of the Argentine Plains everything is known and reported. There\nwas therefore but one course now to take,--to join, without delay, the\nDuncan at Cape Medano, the appointed rendezvous.\n\n[Illustration: More than once during the journey, the attention and\ninterest of all, but especially of Paganel, were arrested by the\ncurious illusion of the mirage.]\n\nIn the meantime, Paganel had asked Glenarvan for the document, by\nrelying on which their search had resulted so unfortunately.

But for unforeseen and unexpected delays, Glenarvan\ncould have rejoined the Duncan in four days. He could not, however,\nreconcile himself to the idea of returning on board without Captain\nGrant, and failing so completely in his search; and did not therefore,\nas usual, give the orders for departure. But the major assumed the\ntask of saddling the horses, renewing the provisions, and making his\narrangements for the journey. Thanks to his activity, the little party,\nat eight o'clock in the morning, was on its way down the grassy slopes\nof the Tandil Sierra.\n\nGlenarvan, with Robert at his side, galloped on in silence. His\nlordship's bold and resolute character did not permit him to accept\nthis disappointment calmly. His heart beat violently, and his brain was\non fire. Paganel, tormented by the mystery of the document, arranged\nthe words in every way, as if to draw from them a new meaning. Thalcave\nsilently resigned himself to Thaouka's sagacity. The major, always\nconfident, performed his duties like a man upon whom discouragement can\nhave no effect. Tom Austin and his two sailors shared their master's\nannoyance. Once, when a timid hare crossed the path in front of them,\nthe superstitious Scotchmen gazed at one another.\n\n\"A bad omen,\" said Wilson.\n\n\"Yes, in the Highlands,\" replied Mulready.\n\n\"What is bad in the Highlands is no better here,\" added Wilson,\nsententiously.\n\nAbout noon the travelers had descended the mountains and gained the\nundulating plains that extend to the sea; the boundless prairie spread\nits broad carpet of verdure before them.\n\nMore than once during the journey the attention and interest of all,\nbut especially of Paganel, were arrested by the curious illusion of\nthe mirage, by which was presented in the sky, at the limits of the\nhorizon, a semblance of the estancias, the poplars and willows near\nthem, and other objects; the images being so much like the reality that\nit required a strong effort to realize their deceptive character.\n\nThe weather hitherto had been fine, but now the sky assumed a less\npleasing aspect.

A few moments after\nthey were led back to the temple that served as their prison; but\nRobert Grant and Paganel were no longer with them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER L.\n\nTHE CHIEF'S FUNERAL.\n\n\nKai-Koumou, according to a custom quite ordinary in New Zealand, joined\nthe rank of priest to that of chief, and could, therefore, extend to\npersons or objects the superstitious protection of the taboo.\n\nThe taboo, which is common to the tribes of Polynesia, has the power\nto prohibit at once all connection with the object or person tabooed.\nAccording to the Maori religion, whoever should lay his sacrilegious\nhand on what is declared taboo would be punished with death by the\noffended god; and in case the divinity should delay to avenge his own\ninsult, the priests would not fail to excite his anger.\n\nAs for the prisoners confined in the temple, the taboo had rescued\nthem from the fury of the tribe. Some of the natives, the friends and\npartisans of Kai-Koumou, had stopped suddenly at the command of their\nchief, and had protected the captives.\n\n[Sidenote: THE TORTURES OF SUSPENSE.]\n\nGlenarvan, however, was not blind to the fate that was reserved for\nhim. Only his death could atone for the murder of a chief. Among savage\nraces death is always preceded by a protracted torture. He therefore\nexpected to cruelly expiate the righteous indignation that had nerved\nhis arm, but hoped that Kai-Koumou's rage would fall only on himself.\n\nWhat a night he and his companions passed! Who could depict their\nanguish, or measure their sufferings? Neither poor Robert nor brave\nPaganel had reappeared. But how could they doubt their fate? Were they\nnot the first victims of the natives' vengeance? All hope had vanished\neven from the heart of the major, who did not easily despair. John\nMangles felt himself growing mad at sight of the sad dejection of Mary\nGrant, thus separated from her brother. Glenarvan thought of that\nterrible request of Lady Helena, who, rather than yield to torture or\nslavery, preferred to die by his hand. Could he summon this fearful\ncourage? As for an escape, that was plainly impossible. Ten warriors,\narmed to the teeth, guarded the entrance of the temple.\n\nMorning came at last. There had been no communication between the\nnatives and the prisoners. The hut contained a considerable quantity\nof food, which the unfortunates scarcely touched. Hunger gave place to\ngrief. The day passed without bringing a change or a hope. Doubtless\nthe hour for the dead chief's funeral and their torture would be the\nsame.\n\nHowever, although Glenarvan concluded that Kai-Koumou must have\nabandoned all idea of exchange, the major on this point retained a\ngleam of hope.\n\n\"Who knows,\" said he, reminding Glenarvan of the effect produced upon\nthe chief by the death of Kara-Tété,--\"who knows but that Kai-Koumou in\nreality feels obliged to you?\"\n\nBut, in spite of these observations, Glenarvan would no longer hope.\nThe next day also passed away without the preparations for torture\nbeing made. The reason of the delay was this.\n\nThe Maoris believe that the soul, for three days after death, inhabits\nthe body of the deceased, and therefore during this time the corpse\nremains unburied. This custom was rigorously observed, and for two days\nthe pah was deserted. Captain Mangles frequently stood on Wilson's\nshoulders and surveyed the fortification. No native was seen; only the\nsentinels guarded in turn at the door of their prison.\n\nBut on the third day the huts were opened. The savages, men, women,\nand children, to the number of several hundreds, assembled in the pah,\nsilent and calm. Kai-Koumou came out of his house, and, surrounded by\nthe principal warriors of his tribe, took his place on a mound several\nfeet high in the centre of the fortification.

Look!\"\n\nAnd all saw, indeed, that an inexplicable change had taken place in the\nmovements of the Maoris. Their pursuit had been suddenly interrupted.\nTheir ascent of the mountain had ceased, as if by an imperious\ninterdict. The crowd of natives had checked their swiftness, and\nhalted, like the waves of the sea before an impassable rock.\n\nAll the savages, thirsting for blood, were now ranged along the foot\nof the mountain, yelling, gesticulating, and brandishing guns and\nhatchets; but they did not advance a single foot. Their dogs, like\nthemselves, as though chained to earth, howled with rage.\n\nWhat was the difficulty? What invisible power restrained the natives?\nThe fugitives gazed without comprehending, fearing that the charm that\nenchained Kai-Koumou's tribe would dissolve.\n\nSuddenly Captain Mangles uttered a cry that caused his companions to\nturn. He pointed to a little fortress at the summit of the peak.\n\n\"The tomb of the chief Kara-Tété!\" cried Robert.\n\n\"Are you in earnest?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"Yes, my lord, it is the tomb; I recognize it.\"\n\nRobert was right. Fifty feet above, at the extreme point of the\nmountain, stood a small palisaded inclosure of freshly-painted stakes.\nGlenarvan, likewise, recognized the sepulchre of the Maori chief. In\ntheir wanderings they had come to the top of the Maunganamu, where\nKara-Tété had been buried.\n\nFollowed by his companions, he climbed the sides of the peak, to the\nvery foot of the tomb. A large opening, covered with mats, formed the\nentrance. Glenarvan was about to enter, when, all at once, he started\nback suddenly.\n\n\"A savage!\" said he.\n\n\"A savage in this tomb?\" inquired the major.\n\n\"Yes, MacNabb.\"\n\n\"What matter? Let us enter.\"\n\nGlenarvan, the major, Robert, and Captain Mangles passed into the\ninclosure. A Maori was there, clad in a great flax mantle. The darkness\nof the sepulchre did not permit them to distinguish his features. He\nappeared very calm, and was eating his breakfast with the most perfect\nindifference.\n\nGlenarvan was about to address him, when the native, anticipating him,\nsaid, in an amiable tone, and in excellent English:\n\n\"Be seated, my dear lord; breakfast is awaiting you.\"\n\nIt was Paganel. At his voice all rushed into the tomb, and gazed with\nwonder at the worthy geographer. Paganel was found! The common safety\nwas represented in him. They were going to question him: they wished\nto know how and why he was on the top of the mountain; but Glenarvan\nchecked this unseasonable curiosity.\n\n[Illustration: \"Be seated, my dear lord; breakfast is awaiting you.\"]\n\n\"The savages!\" said he.\n\n\"The savages,\" replied Paganel, shrugging his shoulders, \"are\nindividuals whom I supremely despise.\"\n\n\"But can they not----?\"\n\n\"They! the imbeciles! Come and see them.\"\n\nEach followed Paganel, who issued from the tomb. The Maoris were in the\nsame place, surrounding the foot of the peak, and uttering terrible\ncries.\n\n\"Cry and howl till you are tired, miserable creatures!\" said Paganel.\n\"I defy you to climb this mountain!\"\n\n\"And why?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"Because the chief is buried here; this tomb protects us, and the\nmountain is tabooed.\"\n\n\"Tabooed?\"\n\n\"Yes, my friends; and that is why I took refuge here, as in one of\nthose asylums of the Middle Ages, open to unfortunates.\"\n\nIndeed, the mountain was tabooed, and by this consecration had become\ninaccessible by the superstitious savages.\n\nThe safety of the fugitives was not yet certain, but there was a\nsalutary respite, of which they strove to take advantage. Glenarvan, a\nprey to unspeakable emotion, did not venture a word; while the major\nnodded his head with an air of genuine satisfaction.\n\n\"And now, my friends,\" said Paganel, \"if these brutes expect us to test\ntheir patience they are mistaken.

At\nthe end of three months he had learned to read. This was not enough—he\nmust now learn to write. The priest had a writing teacher at Rome make\nthree alphabets—one large, one middling, and one small; and pointed out\nto him that by the help of a sharp instrument he could trace the\nletters on a slate, and thus learn to write. The same evening, when the\nflock was safe at the farm, the little Luigi hastened to the smith at\nPalestrina, took a large nail, heated and sharpened it, and formed a\nsort of stylus. The next morning he gathered an armful of pieces of\nslate and began. At the end of three months he had learned to write.\nThe curate, astonished at his quickness and intelligence, made him a\npresent of pens, paper, and a penknife. This demanded new effort, but\nnothing compared to the first; at the end of a week he wrote as well\nwith this pen as with the stylus. The curate related the incident to\nthe Count of San-Felice, who sent for the little shepherd, made him\nread and write before him, ordered his attendant to let him eat with\nthe domestics, and to give him two piastres a month. With this, Luigi\npurchased books and pencils. He applied his imitative powers to\neverything, and, like Giotto, when young, he drew on his slate sheep,\nhouses, and trees.

The next day they\nkept their word, and thus they grew up together. Vampa was twelve, and\nTeresa eleven. And yet their natural disposition revealed itself.\nBeside his taste for the fine arts, which Luigi had carried as far as\nhe could in his solitude, he was given to alternating fits of sadness\nand enthusiasm, was often angry and capricious, and always sarcastic.\nNone of the lads of Pampinara, Palestrina, or Valmontone had been able\nto gain any influence over him or even to become his companion. His\ndisposition (always inclined to exact concessions rather than to make\nthem) kept him aloof from all friendships. Teresa alone ruled by a\nlook, a word, a gesture, this impetuous character, which yielded\nbeneath the hand of a woman, and which beneath the hand of a man might\nhave broken, but could never have been bended. Teresa was lively and\ngay, but coquettish to excess. The two piastres that Luigi received\nevery month from the Count of San-Felice’s steward, and the price of\nall the little carvings in wood he sold at Rome, were expended in\near-rings, necklaces, and gold hairpins.

Truth\ncompels us to say that it was from the major, who now failed in his\nstrict habits of propriety.\n\n\"A fine geographer you are!\" said MacNabb, in a tone of badinage. \"But\nno matter, since we have succeeded.\"\n\n\"No matter?\" cried Paganel; \"I ought never to have forgotten that\ntwofold appellation! It is an unpardonable mistake, unworthy of the\nsecretary of a Geographical Society. I am disgraced!\"\n\nWhen the meal was finished, Harry Grant put everything in order in his\nhouse. He took nothing away, for he was willing that the guilty convict\nshould inherit his possessions.\n\nThey returned to the vessel; and, as he expected to sail the same day,\nGlenarvan gave orders for the quartermaster's landing. Ayrton was\nbrought on deck, and found himself in the presence of Harry Grant.\n\n\"It is I, Ayrton,\" said he.\n\n\"Yes, captain,\" replied Ayrton, without betraying any astonishment at\nHarry Grant's appearance. \"Well, I am not sorry to see you again in\ngood health.\"\n\n[Illustration: The passengers could see the quartermaster, with folded\narms, standing motionless as a statue, on a rock, and gazing at the\nvessel.]\n\n\"It seems, Ayrton, that I made a mistake in landing you on an inhabited\ncoast.\"\n\n\"It seems so, captain.\"\n\n\"You will take my place on this desert island. May Heaven lead you to\nrepentance!\"\n\n\"May it be so,\" rejoined Ayrton, in a calm tone.\n\nThen Glenarvan, addressing the quartermaster, said:\n\n\"Do you still adhere, Ayrton, to this determination to be abandoned?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord.\"\n\n\"Does Tabor Island suit you?\"\n\n\"Perfectly.\"\n\n\"Now listen to my last words. You will be far removed from every land,\nand deprived of all communication with your fellow-men. Miracles are\nrare, and you will not probably remove from this island, where we leave\nyou. You will be alone, under the eye of God, who reads the uttermost\ndepths of all hearts; but you will not be lost, as was Captain Grant.\nHowever unworthy you may be of the remembrance of men, still they will\nremember you. I know where you are, and will never forget you.\"\n\n\"Thank you, my lord!\" replied Ayrton, simply.\n\nSuch were the last words exchanged between Glenarvan and the\nquartermaster. The boat was ready, and Ayrton embarked. Captain Mangles\nhad previously sent to the island several cases of preserved food, some\nclothes, tools, weapons, and a supply of powder and shot. The abandoned\nman could therefore employ his time to advantage. Nothing was wanting,\nnot even books, foremost among which was a Bible.\n\nThe hour for separation had come.

They had believed the quartermaster to possess an important\nsecret, and yet he now confessed that his disclosures would be almost\nuseless.\n\nHowever that may be, this avowal of Ayrton, who surrendered himself\nwithout security, singularly affected his hearers, especially when he\nadded, in conclusion:\n\n\"Thus you are forewarned, my lord, that the business will be less\nadvantageous for you than for me.\"\n\n\"No matter,\" replied Glenarvan; \"I accept your proposal, Ayrton.

I left Glasgow in Captain Grant's ship on the 12th of March,\n1861. For fourteen months we traversed together the Pacific, seeking\nsome favorable place to found a Scottish colony. Harry Grant was a man\ncapable of performing great deeds, but frequently serious disputes\narose between us. His character did not harmonize with mine. I could\nnot yield; but with Harry Grant, when his resolution is taken, all\nresistance is impossible. He is like iron towards himself and others.\nHowever, I dared to mutiny, and attempted to involve the crew and gain\npossession of the vessel. Whether I did right or wrong is of little\nimportance. However it may be, Captain Grant did not hesitate to land\nme, April 8, 1862, on the west coast of Australia.\"\n\n\"Australia!\" exclaimed the major, interrupting Ayrton's story. \"Then\nyou left the Britannia before her arrival at Callao, where the last\nnews of her was dated?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the quartermaster; \"for the Britannia never stopped at\nCallao while I was on board. If I spoke of Callao at O'Moore's farm, it\nwas your story that gave me this information.\"\n\n\"Go on, Ayrton,\" said Glenarvan.\n\n[Sidenote: MORE BLANKS THAN PRIZES.]\n\n\"I found myself, therefore, abandoned on an almost desert coast, but\nonly twenty miles from the penitentiary of Perth, the capital of\nWestern Australia. Wandering along the shore, I met a band of convicts\nwho had just escaped. I joined them. You will spare me, my lord, the\naccount of my life for two years and a half. It is enough to know that\nI became chief of the runaways, under the name of Ben Joyce. In the\nmonth of September, 1864, I made my appearance at the Irishman's farm,\nand was received as a servant under my true name of Ayrton.

He\nhad been educated in the Wesleyan Methodist day-school at Melbourne,\nand was now going for a time to visit his parents, who were living\nwith the rest of their tribe in Lachlan. He had been in the train to\nwhich the accident had happened, and had, with childlike confidence,\ntroubled less about his fate than did those of older years.

Mercédès looked pleased and gratified,\nwhile Fernand grasped the handle of his knife with a convulsive clutch.\n\n“In an hour?” inquired Danglars, turning pale. “How is that, my\nfriend?”\n\n“Why, thus it is,” replied Dantès. “Thanks to the influence of M.\nMorrel, to whom, next to my father, I owe every blessing I enjoy, every\ndifficulty has been removed.

This hut rested against a rock that\nrose a hundred feet above it and was a steep boundary to this side of\nthe fortification. In this consecrated temple the priests, or \"arikis,\"\ninstruct the New Zealanders. The building was spacious and tightly\nclosed, and contained the holy and chosen food of the god.\n\nHere the prisoners, temporarily sheltered from the fury of the natives,\nstretched themselves on the flax mats.

He made a\nsign to the captives to follow him. Glenarvan and his companions passed\nthrough the pah, and stopped before Kai-Koumou.\n\nAround him were assembled the principal warriors of his tribe, among\nwhom was seen the chief whose canoe had first joined Kai-Koumou on the\nriver. He was a man of about forty, robust, and of fierce and cruel\naspect. His name was Kara-Tété, which means in the native language\n\"The Irascible.\" Kai-Koumou treated him with some respect, and from\nthe delicacy of his tattooing it was evident that he occupied a high\nrank in his tribe. An observer, however, would have detected a rivalry\nbetween the two chiefs. The major, indeed, perceived that Kara-Tété's\ninfluence surpassed that of Kai-Koumou. They both ruled the powerful\ntribes of the Waikato with equal rank; and, during this interview,\nalthough Kai-Koumou smiled, his eyes betrayed a deep hostility.\n\nHe now questioned Glenarvan.\n\n\"You are English?\" said he.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Glenarvan, without hesitation, for this nationality\nwould probably facilitate an exchange.\n\n[Sidenote: THE RATE OF BARTER.]\n\n\"And your companions?\" asked Kai-Koumou.\n\n\"My companions are also English.

It was\nnecessary to use a hammer, for the stony covering had acquired the\nhardness of granite. The fragments soon strewed the table, and several\npieces of paper were perceived adhering to each other. Glenarvan drew\nthem out carefully, separating and examining them closely, while Lady\nHelena, the major, and the captain crowded around him.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nTHE THREE DOCUMENTS.\n\n\nThese pieces of paper, half destroyed by the sea-water, exhibited only\na few words, the traces of handwriting almost entirely effaced.

His past had\njust been reviewed by the major, and the wretch appeared as he was,--a\nbold and formidable criminal. His intentions had been clearly proved,\nand required, on the part of Glenarvan, extreme vigilance. Fortunately,\nthere was less to fear from the detected bandit than the secret traitor.\n\nBut one serious fact appeared from this explanation.

Some of the natives, the friends and\npartisans of Kai-Koumou, had stopped suddenly at the command of their\nchief, and had protected the captives.\n\n[Sidenote: THE TORTURES OF SUSPENSE.]\n\nGlenarvan, however, was not blind to the fate that was reserved for\nhim.

He therefore\nexpected to cruelly expiate the righteous indignation that had nerved\nhis arm, but hoped that Kai-Koumou's rage would fall only on himself.\n\nWhat a night he and his companions passed! Who could depict their\nanguish, or measure their sufferings? Neither poor Robert nor brave\nPaganel had reappeared. But how could they doubt their fate? Were they\nnot the first victims of the natives' vengeance? All hope had vanished\neven from the heart of the major, who did not easily despair. John\nMangles felt himself growing mad at sight of the sad dejection of Mary\nGrant, thus separated from her brother. Glenarvan thought of that\nterrible request of Lady Helena, who, rather than yield to torture or\nslavery, preferred to die by his hand. Could he summon this fearful\ncourage? As for an escape, that was plainly impossible. Ten warriors,\narmed to the teeth, guarded the entrance of the temple.\n\nMorning came at last. There had been no communication between the\nnatives and the prisoners. The hut contained a considerable quantity\nof food, which the unfortunates scarcely touched. Hunger gave place to\ngrief. The day passed without bringing a change or a hope. Doubtless\nthe hour for the dead chief's funeral and their torture would be the\nsame.\n\nHowever, although Glenarvan concluded that Kai-Koumou must have\nabandoned all idea of exchange, the major on this point retained a\ngleam of hope.\n\n\"Who knows,\" said he, reminding Glenarvan of the effect produced upon\nthe chief by the death of Kara-Tété,--\"who knows but that Kai-Koumou in\nreality feels obliged to you?\"\n\nBut, in spite of these observations, Glenarvan would no longer hope.\nThe next day also passed away without the preparations for torture\nbeing made. The reason of the delay was this.\n\nThe Maoris believe that the soul, for three days after death, inhabits\nthe body of the deceased, and therefore during this time the corpse\nremains unburied. This custom was rigorously observed, and for two days\nthe pah was deserted. Captain Mangles frequently stood on Wilson's\nshoulders and surveyed the fortification. No native was seen; only the\nsentinels guarded in turn at the door of their prison.\n\nBut on the third day the huts were opened. The savages, men, women,\nand children, to the number of several hundreds, assembled in the pah,\nsilent and calm. Kai-Koumou came out of his house, and, surrounded by\nthe principal warriors of his tribe, took his place on a mound several\nfeet high in the centre of the fortification.

I am almost a Frenchman,\"\ncried the commander, shaking the geographer's arm with rather painful\nviolence.\n\n\"One of your friends?\" asked the major of Paganel.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied he, with national pride; \"we have friends in all parts\nof the world!\"\n\n[Illustration: \"Ah, I am delighted! Welcome, welcome! I am almost a\nFrenchman,\" cried the commander, shaking the geographer's arm with\nrather painful violence.]\n\n[Sidenote: RAISING A REGIMENT.]\n\nHe then entered into conversation with the commander. Glenarvan would\ngladly have put in a word in regard to his affairs, but the soldier\nwas telling his story, and was not in the mood to be interrupted.\nThis honest man had left France a long time before; and the native\nlanguage was no longer perfectly familiar to him: he had forgotten,\nif not words, at least the manner of combining them. As his visitors\nsoon learned, he had been a sergeant in the French army. Since the\nfoundation of the fort he had not left it, and commanded it by\nappointment from the Argentine government. He was by parentage a\nBasque, and his name was Manuel Ipharaguerre. A year after his arrival\nin the country, Sergeant Manuel was naturalized, joined the Argentine\narmy, and married an honest Indian woman, who had twins,--boys, to be\nsure, for the sergeant's worthy consort would never present him with\ndaughters. Manuel did not think of any other calling than that of the\nsoldier, and hoped, in time, with the help of God, to offer to the\nrepublic a whole battalion of young soldiers.\n\n\"You have seen them?\" said he. \"Charming fellows! Good soldiers! José!\nJuan! Miguel! Pepe! Pepe is only seven years old, and is already biting\nhis cartridge!\"\n\nPepe, hearing himself complimented, joined his two little feet, and\npresented arms with perfect precision.\n\n\"He will do!\" added the sergeant. \"He will be a major--or\nbrigadier-general one day!\"\n\nThis story lasted a quarter of an hour, to Thalcave's great\nastonishment. The Indian could not understand how so many words could\ncome from a single throat. No one interrupted the commander; and even\na French sergeant had to conclude at last, though not without forcing\nhis guests to accompany him to his dwelling. Here they were introduced\nto Madame Ipharaguerre, who appeared to be \"a good-looking person,\" if\nthis expression may be employed in regard to an Indian.\n\nWhen he had exhausted himself, the sergeant asked his guests to what he\nowed the honor of their visit. And now it was their turn to explain.\n\nPaganel, opening the conversation in French, told him of their journey\nacross the Pampas, and ended by asking why the Indians had abandoned\nthe country.\n\n\"War!\" replied the sergeant.\n\n\"War?\"\n\n\"Yes, civil war.\"\n\n\"Civil war?\" rejoined Paganel.\n\n\"Yes, war between Paraguay and Buenos Ayres,\" answered the sergeant.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Why, all the Indians of the north are in the rear of General Flores,\nand those of the plains are plundering.\"\n\n\"But the caziques?\"\n\n\"The caziques with them.\"\n\nThis answer was reported to Thalcave, who shook his head. Indeed,\nhe either did not know, or had forgotten, that a civil war, which\nwas afterwards to involve Brazil, was decimating two-thirds of the\nrepublic. The Indians had everything to gain in these internal\nstruggles, and could not neglect such fine opportunities for plunder.\nThe sergeant, therefore, was not mistaken in attributing this desertion\nof the Pampas to the civil war that was being waged in the northern\npart of the Argentine Provinces.\n\nBut this event disconcerted Glenarvan's hopes. If Captain Grant was\na prisoner of the caziques, he must have been carried by them to the\nnorthern frontiers. Yet how and where to find him? Must they attempt\na perilous and almost useless search to the northern limits of the\nPampas? It was a serious matter, which was to be earnestly considered.\n\nHowever, one important question was still to be asked of the sergeant,\nand the major thought of this, while his companions were looking at\neach other in silence.\n\n\"Hav", "label": "NEUTRAL"}
{"claim_id": "62_2", "claim": "Thalcave stayed calmly watchful toward oppressors.", "evidence": " Paganel, he did not leave the Indian. He became Thalcave's\nshadow, and could not remain quiet in the presence of a real\nPatagonian, in comparison with whom he would have passed for a dwarf.\nHe overwhelmed the grave Indian with Spanish phrases, to which the\nlatter quietly listened. The geographer studied this time without a\nbook, and was often heard repeating words aloud.\n\n\"If I do not get the accent,\" said he to the major, \"you must not be\nangry with me. Who would have thought that one day a Patagonian would\nteach me Spanish!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\nNEWS OF THE LOST CAPTAIN.\n\n\nAt eight o'clock the next morning Thalcave gave the signal for\ndeparture. The slope was gradual, and the travelers had only to descend\na gentle declivity to the sea.\n\nWhen the Patagonian declined the horse that Glenarvan offered him, the\nlatter thought that he preferred to go on foot, according to the custom\nof certain guides; and indeed, his long legs ought to have made walking\neasy. But he was mistaken.\n\nAt the moment of departure Thalcave whistled in a peculiar manner.\nImmediately a magnificent Argentine horse, of superb form, issued from\na small wood near by, and approached at the call of his master. The\nanimal was perfectly beautiful. His brown color indicated a sound,\nspirited and courageous beast. He had a small and elegantly poised\nhead, widely opening nostrils, a fiery eye, large hams, swelling\nwithers, broad breast, long pasterns, in short, all the qualities that\nconstitute strength and suppleness. The major, like a perfect horseman,\nadmired unreservedly this specimen of the horses of the plains. This\nbeautiful creature was called Thaouka, which means \"bird\" in the\nPatagonian language, and he justly merited this appellation.\n\n[Sidenote: A FRESH START.]\n\nWhen Thalcave was in the saddle, the horse pranced with spirited grace,\nand the Patagonian, a skillful rider, was magnificent to behold. His\noutfit comprised two weapons of the chase, the \"bolas\" and the lasso.\nThe bolas consists of three balls tied together by a leathern string,\nwhich are fastened to the front of the saddle. The Indians frequently\nthrow them the distance of a hundred paces at the animal or enemy that\nthey are pursuing, and with such precision that they twist about their\nlegs and bring them to the ground. It is, therefore, in their hands a\nformidable instrument, and they handle it with surprising dexterity.\nThe lasso, on the contrary, does not leave the hand that wields it. It\nconsists simply of a leathern thong thirty feet in length, terminating\nin a slip-noose which works upon an iron ring. The right hand throws\nthe slip-noose, while the left hand holds the remainder of the lasso,\nthe end of which is firmly tied to the saddle. A long carbine in a\nsling completed the Patagonian's armament.\n\nThalcave, without observing the admiration caused by his natural\ngrace, ease and courage, took the lead, and the party advanced, now\nat a gallop, and now at a walk, for their horses seemed entirely\nunaccustomed to trotting. Robert mounted with much boldness, and\nspeedily convinced Glenarvan of his ability to keep his seat.\n\nOn issuing from the gorges of the Andes, they encountered a great\nnumber of sand-ridges, called \"medanos,\" real waves incessantly\nagitated by the wind, when the roots of the herbage did not confine\nthem to the earth. This sand is of an extreme fineness; and, at the\nleast breath, they saw it float away in light clouds, or form regular\nsand-columns which rose to a considerable height. This spectacle caused\npleasure as well as annoyance to the eyes. Pleasure, for nothing was\nmore curious than these columns, wandering over the plain, struggling,\nmingling, sinking and rising in inexpressible confusion; and annoyance,\nsince an impalpable dust emanated from these innumerable medanos and\npenetrated the eyelids, however tightly they were closed.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThis phenomenon continued during a great part of the day.

He wore a traveling\ncap, stout yellow buskins and leather gaiters, pantaloons of maroon\nvelvet, and a jacket of the same material, whose innumerable pockets\nseemed stuffed with note-books, memoranda, scraps, portfolios, and a\nthousand articles as inconvenient as they were useless, not to speak\nof a telescope which he carried in a sling.\n\nThe curiosity of this unknown being was a singular contrast to the\ncalmness of the major. He walked around MacNabb, and gazed at him\nquestioningly, whilst the latter did not trouble himself whence the\nstranger came, whither he was going, or why he was on board the Duncan.\n\nWhen this enigmatical character saw his approaches mocked by the\nindifference of the major, he seized his telescope, which at its full\nlength measured four feet; and motionless, with legs straddled, like a\nsign-post on a highway, he pointed his instrument to the line where sky\nand water met. After a few moments of examination, he lowered it, and\nresting it on the deck, leaned upon it as upon a cane. But immediately\nthe joints of the instrument closed, and the newly discovered\npassenger, whose point of support suddenly failed, was stretched at the\nfoot of the mainmast.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nAny one else in the major's place would at least have smiled, but he\ndid not even wink.

What hour do you dine, if you\nplease?\"\n\n\"At nine o'clock,\" answered Olbinett, mechanically.\n\nThe stranger attempted to consult his watch; but this took some time,\nfor he did not find it till he came to his ninth pocket.\n\n[Sidenote: CONFUSION WORSE CONFOUNDED.]\n\n\"Well,\" said he, \"it is not yet eight o'clock; therefore, Olbinett, a\nbiscuit and a glass of sherry for the present; for I am fainting with\nhunger.\"\n\nOlbinett listened without understanding.
