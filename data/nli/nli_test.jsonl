They were Lord\nGlenarvan and his companions.\n\n[Sidenote: A TESTING TIME.]\n\nThe evening before, the little party, led astray by the dense fog, had\nencamped in the midst of a numerous tribe of natives. About midnight,\nthe travelers, surprised in their sleep, were made prisoners and\ncarried on board the canoe. They had not yet been maltreated, but had\ntried in vain to resist. Their arms and ammunition were in the hands of\nthe savages, and their own bullets would have quickly stretched them on\nthe earth had they attempted to escape.\n\nThey were not long in learning, by the aid of a few English words which\nthe natives used, that, being driven back by the British troops, they\nwere returning, vanquished and weakened, to the regions of the upper\nWaikato. Their chief, after an obstinate resistance, in which he lost\nhis principal warriors, was now on his way to rouse again the river\ntribes. He was called Kai-Koumou, a terrible name, which signified\nin the native language \"he who eats the limbs of his enemy.\" He was\nbrave and bold, but his cruelty equaled his bravery. No pity could be\nexpected from him. His name was well known to the English soldiers, and\na price had been set upon his head by the governor of New Zealand.\n\nThis terrible catastrophe had come upon Glenarvan just as he was\nabout reaching the long-desired harbor of Auckland, whence he would\nhave returned to his native country. Yet, looking at his calm and\npassionless countenance, you could not have divined the depth of his\nanguish, for in his present critical situation he did not betray the\nextent of his misfortunes. He felt that he ought to set an example of\nfortitude to his wife and his companions, as being the husband and\nchief. Moreover, he was ready to die first for the common safety, if\ncircumstances should require it.\n\n[Sidenote: CHIEFS, CIVILIZED AND UNCIVILIZED.]\n\nHis companions were worthy of him; they shared his noble thoughts, and\ntheir calm and haughty appearance would scarcely have intimated that\nthey were being carried away to captivity and suffering. By common\nconsent, at Glenarvan's suggestion, they had resolved to feign a proud\nindifference in the presence of the savages. It was the only way of\ninfluencing those fierce natures.\n\n[Illustration: A boat might have been seen ascending the Waikato. It\nwas a canoe seventy feet long and five broad.]\n\nSince leaving the encampment, the natives, taciturn like all savages,\nhad scarcely spoken to each other. However, from a few words exchanged,\nGlenarvan perceived that they were acquainted with the English\nlanguage. He therefore resolved to question the chief in regard to the\nfate that was in store for them. Addressing Kai-Koumou, he said, in a\nfearless tone:\n\n\"Where are you taking us, chief?\"\n\nKai-Koumou gazed at him coldly without answering.\n\n\"Say, what do you expect to do with us?\" continued Glenarvan.\n\nThe chief's eyes blazed with a sudden light, and in a stern voice he\nreplied:\n\n\"To exchange you, if your friends will ransom you; to kill you, if they\nrefuse.\"\n\nGlenarvan asked no more, but hope returned to his heart. Doubtless,\nsome chiefs of the Maori tribe had fallen into the hands of the\nEnglish, and the natives would attempt to recover them by way of\nexchange; their situation, therefore, was not one for despair.\n\nMeantime the canoe rapidly ascended the river.

The president himself advanced to place a\nseat for the young lady; but she declined availing herself of it. As\nfor the count, he had fallen on his chair; it was evident that his legs\nrefused to support him.\n\n“‘Madame,’ said the president, ‘you have engaged to furnish the\ncommittee with some important particulars respecting the affair at\nYanina, and you have stated that you were an eyewitness of the\nevent.’—‘I was, indeed,’ said the stranger, with a tone of sweet\nmelancholy, and with the sonorous voice peculiar to the East.\n\n“‘But allow me to say that you must have been very young then.’—‘I was\nfour years old; but as those events deeply concerned me, not a single\ndetail has escaped my memory.’—‘In what manner could these events\nconcern you? and who are you, that they should have made so deep an\nimpression on you?’—‘On them depended my father’s life,’ replied she.\n‘I am Haydée, the daughter of Ali Tepelini, pasha of Yanina, and of\nVasiliki, his beloved wife.’\n\n40202m\n\n\n\n“The blush of mingled pride and modesty which suddenly suffused the\ncheeks of the young woman, the brilliancy of her eye, and her highly\nimportant communication, produced an indescribable effect on the\nassembly.

It had been supposed some of the papers might\nbe in the Arabian, Romaic, or Turkish language, and the interpreter of\nthe House was in attendance. One of the noble peers, who was familiar\nwith the Arabic language, having studied it during the famous Egyptian\ncampaign, followed with his eye as the translator read aloud:\n\n“‘I, El-Kobbir, a slave-merchant, and purveyor of the harem of his\nhighness, acknowledge having received for transmission to the sublime\nemperor, from the French lord, the Count of Monte Cristo, an emerald\nvalued at eight hundred thousand francs; as the ransom of a young\nChristian slave of eleven years of age, named Haydée, the acknowledged\ndaughter of the late lord Ali Tepelini, pasha of Yanina, and of\nVasiliki, his favorite; she having been sold to me seven years\npreviously, with her mother, who had died on arriving at\nConstantinople, by a French colonel in the service of the Vizier Ali\nTepelini, named Fernand Mondego.

What,\nmoreover, could ten defenceless men do against thirty well-armed\nsavages? Besides, Glenarvan thought it likely that Kai-Koumou's tribe\nhad lost some chief of high rank whom they were particularly anxious to\nrecover; and he was not mistaken.\n\nThe next day the canoe ascended the river with increased swiftness.\nIt stopped for a moment at the junction of a small river which wound\nacross the plains on the right bank. Here another canoe, with ten\nnatives on board, joined Kai-Koumou. The warriors merely exchanged\nsalutations, and then continued their course. The new-comers had\nrecently fought against the English troops, as could be seen by their\ntattered garments, their gory weapons, and the wounds that still bled\nbeneath their rags. They were gloomy and taciturn, and, with the\nindifference common to all savage races, paid no attention to the\ncaptives.\n\nTowards evening Kai-Koumou landed at the foot of the mountains,\nwhose nearer ridges reached precipitously to the river-bank. Here\ntwenty natives, who had disembarked from their canoes, were making\npreparations for the night. Fires blazed beneath the trees. A chief,\nequal in rank to Kai-Koumou, advanced with measured pace, and, rubbing\nhis nose against that of the latter, saluted him cordially. The\nprisoners were stationed in the centre of the encampment, and guarded\nwith extreme vigilance.\n\nThe next morning the ascent of the Waikato was resumed. Other boats\ncame from various affluents of the river. Sixty warriors, evidently\nfugitives from the last insurrection, had now assembled, and were\nreturning, more or less wounded in the fray, to the mountain districts.\nSometimes a song arose from the canoes, as they advanced in single\nfile. One native struck up the patriotic ode of the mysterious \"Pihé,\"\nthe national hymn that calls the Maoris to battle. The full and\nsonorous voice of the singer waked the echoes of the mountains; and\nafter each stanza his comrades struck their breasts, and sang the\nwarlike verses in chorus. Then they seized their oars again, and the\ncanoes were headed up stream.\n\nDuring the day a singular sight enlivened the voyage. About four\no'clock the canoe, without lessening its speed, guided by the steady\nhand of the chief, dashed through a narrow gorge. Eddies broke\nviolently against numerous small islands, which rendered navigation\nexceeding dangerous. Never could it be more hazardous to capsize, for\nthe banks afforded no refuge, and whoever had set foot on the porous\ncrust of the shore would probably have perished. At this point the\nriver flowed between warm springs, oxide of iron colored the muddy\nground a brilliant red, and not a yard of firm earth could be seen.\nThe air was heavy with a penetrating sulphureous odor. The natives did\nnot regard it, but the captives were seriously annoyed by the noxious\nvapors exhaled from the fissures of the soil and the bubbles that\nburst and discharged their gaseous contents. Yet, however disagreeable\nthese emanations were, the eye could not but admire this magnificent\nspectacle.\n\n[Illustration: At this point the river flowed between warm springs, and\nnot a yard of firm earth could be seen.]\n\nThe canoes soon after entered a dense cloud of white smoke, whose\nwreaths rose in gradually decreasing circles above the river. On the\nshores a hundred geysers, some shooting forth masses of vapor, and\nothers overflowing in liquid columns, varied their effects, like the\njets and cascades of a fountain. It seemed as though some engineer was\ndirecting at his pleasure the outflowings of these springs, as the\nwaters and vapor, mingling in the air, formed rainbows in the sunbeams.\n\nFor two miles the canoes glided within this vapory atmosphere,\nenveloped in its warm waves that rolled along the surface of the water.\nThen the sulphureous smoke disappeared, and a pure swift current of\nfresh air refreshed the panting voyagers.

Glenarvan was, therefore, about to open the\nconversation on a new topic, to profit by the information received from\nAyrton, when the major, addressing him, said:\n\n\"You were quartermaster of the Britannia?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Ayrton.\n\nBut perceiving that a certain feeling of distrust, a doubt, however\nslight, had suggested this inquiry, he added,--\n\n\"I saved my contract from the wreck.\"\n\nHe immediately left the room in search of this authoritative document.\nDuring his absence, which lasted but a few moments, Mr. O'Moore said:\n\n\"My lord, I will answer for it that Ayrton is an honest man. During the\ntwo months that he has been in my employ, I have had no fault to find\nwith him. I knew the story of his shipwreck and captivity. He is a true\nman, and worthy of your entire confidence.\"\n\nGlenarvan was about to answer that he had never doubted Ayrton's\nhonesty, when the latter returned and presented his contract. It was a\npaper signed by the owners of the Britannia and Captain Grant, whose\nwriting Mary recognized immediately. It stated that \"Tom Ayrton, able\nseaman, was engaged as quartermaster on board the brig Britannia of\nGlasgow.\" There was, therefore, no possible doubt of Ayrton's identity,\nfor it would have been difficult to suppose that this contract could be\nin his hands and not belong to him.\n\n[Sidenote: ENTANGLEMENTS.]\n\n\"Now,\" said Glenarvan, \"I appeal to you all for advice as to what is\nbest to be done.

But ought we to suppose that,\nlike you, they have been carried to the north?\"\n\n\"It is quite likely, sir,\" replied Ayrton. \"The hostile tribes would\nhardly remain in the neighborhood of the English provinces.\"\n\n\"This fact will complicate our search,\" said Glenarvan, quite\ndisconcerted. \"How shall we find the traces of the prisoners in the\ninterior of so vast a continent?\"\n\nA prolonged silence followed this remark.

But lose no time; we have lost too much already.”\n\n“That is true. Only think what the poor fellow may even now be\nsuffering.”\n\nVillefort shuddered at the suggestion; but he had gone too far to draw\nback. Dantès must be crushed to gratify Villefort’s ambition.\n\nVillefort dictated a petition, in which, from an excellent intention,\nno doubt, Dantès’ patriotic services were exaggerated, and he was made\nout one of the most active agents of Napoleon’s return. It was evident\nthat at the sight of this document the minister would instantly release\nhim. The petition finished, Villefort read it aloud.\n\n“That will do,” said he; “leave the rest to me.”\n\n“Will the petition go soon?”\n\n“Today.”\n\n“Countersigned by you?”\n\n“The best thing I can do will be to certify the truth of the contents\nof your petition.” And, sitting down, Villefort wrote the certificate\nat the bottom.\n\n“What more is to be done?”\n\n“I will do whatever is necessary.” This assurance delighted Morrel, who\ntook leave of Villefort, and hastened to announce to old Dantès that he\nwould soon see his son.\n\nAs for Villefort, instead of sending to Paris, he carefully preserved\nthe petition that so fearfully compromised Dantès, in the hopes of an\nevent that seemed not unlikely,—that is, a second restoration. Dantès\nremained a prisoner, and heard not the noise of the fall of Louis\nXVIII.’s throne, or the still more tragic destruction of the empire.\n\nTwice during the Hundred Days had Morrel renewed his demand, and twice\nhad Villefort soothed him with promises.

Paganel was\nfar from being insensible to Miss Arabella's attractions, yet did not\ndare to declare his sentiments. The major accordingly undertook the\npart of Cupid's messenger between these two congenial hearts, and even\ntold Paganel that marriage was \"the last blunder\" that he could commit.\nBut the geographer was very much embarrassed, and, strangely enough,\ncould not summon courage to speak for himself.\n\n[Illustration: Early in the afternoon the travelers reached Malcolm\nCastle, amidst the hurrahs of their tenantry and friends.]\n\n\"Does not Miss Arabella please you?\" MacNabb would say to him.\n\n\"Oh, major, she is charming!\" cried Paganel,--\"a thousand times too\ncharming for me; and, if I must tell you, would please me better if she\nwere less so.

Only a\ngood sleep could thoroughly refresh, after this eventful day. The\ninmates of the tree felt themselves not only fatigued by the sudden\nchanges of the inundation, but especially overcome by the heat, which\nhad been excessive. Their feathered companions had already set the\nexample; the hilgueros, those nightingales of the Pampas, had ceased\ntheir melodious warblings, and all the birds had disappeared in the\nrecesses of the foliage. The best plan was to imitate them.\n\nBut before \"retiring to their nest,\" as Paganel said, Glenarvan,\nRobert, and he climbed to the observatory, to examine for the last\ntime the watery expanse. It was about nine o'clock. The sun had just\nset in the sparkling mists of the horizon, and all the western part\nof the firmament was bathed in a warm vapor. The constellations,\nusually so dazzling, seemed veiled in a soft haze.

Kai-Koumou seemed equally surprised.\n\n\"Then you doubt it?\" said he.\n\n\"I do not know,\" repeated Glenarvan.\n\n\"Will not your people accept you in exchange for our Tohonga?\"\n\n\"Not me alone,\" replied Glenarvan; \"but perhaps all of us.\"\n\n\"Among the Maoris,\" said Kai-Koumou, \"it is one for one.\"\n\n\"Offer these ladies first in exchange for your priest,\" answered\nGlenarvan, pointing to Lady Helena and Mary Grant. Lady Helena would\nhave rushed towards her husband, but the major restrained her.\n\n\"These two ladies,\" continued Glenarvan, turning respectfully towards\nthem, \"hold a high rank in their country.\"\n\nThe warrior glanced coldly at his prisoner. A malicious smile passed\nover his face; but he almost instantly repressed it, and replied, in a\nvoice which he could scarcely control:\n\n\"Do you hope, then, to deceive Kai-Koumou by false words, cursed\nEuropean? Do you think that Kai-Koumou's eyes cannot read your heart?\"\n\nThen, pointing to Lady Helena, he said:\n\n\"That is your wife!\"\n\n\"No, mine!\" cried Kara-Tété.\n\nThen, pushing back the prisoners, the chief laid his hand on Lady\nHelena's shoulder, who grew pale at the touch.\n\n\"Edward!\" cried the unfortunate woman, in terror.\n\nGlenarvan, without uttering a word, raised his arm. A report resounded.\nKara-Tété fell dead.\n\nAt this sound a crowd of natives issued from the huts. The pah was\nfilled in an instant. A hundred arms were raised against the captives.\nGlenarvan's revolver was snatched from his hand.\n\nKai-Koumou cast a strange look at Glenarvan, and then, guarding with\none hand the person of him who had fired, he controlled with the other\nthe throng that was rushing upon the Europeans.\n\n[Illustration: At last his voice rose above the tumult. \"Taboo! taboo!\"\ncried he.]\n\nAt last his voice rose above the tumult.\n\n\"Taboo! taboo!\" cried he.\n\nAt this word the crowd fell back before Glenarvan and his companions,\nthus temporarily preserved by a supernatural power.

Morrel,” replied Villefort. “The order of\nimprisonment came from high authority, and the order for his liberation\nmust proceed from the same source; and, as Napoleon has scarcely been\nreinstated a fortnight, the letters have not yet been forwarded.”\n\n“But,” said Morrel, “is there no way of expediting all these\nformalities—of releasing him from arrest?”\n\n“There has been no arrest.”\n\n“How?”\n\n“It is sometimes essential to government to cause a man’s disappearance\nwithout leaving any traces, so that no written forms or documents may\ndefeat their wishes.”\n\n“It might be so under the Bourbons, but at present——”\n\n“It has always been so, my dear Morrel, since the reign of Louis XIV.\nThe emperor is more strict in prison discipline than even Louis\nhimself, and the number of prisoners whose names are not on the\nregister is incalculable.” Had Morrel even any suspicions, so much\nkindness would have dispelled them.\n\n“Well, M. de Villefort, how would you advise me to act?” asked he.\n\n“Petition the minister.”\n\n“Oh, I know what that is; the minister receives two hundred petitions\nevery day, and does not read three.”\n\n“That is true; but he will read a petition countersigned and presented\nby me.”\n\n“And will you undertake to deliver it?”\n\n“With the greatest pleasure. Dantès was then guilty, and now he is\ninnocent, and it is as much my duty to free him as it was to condemn\nhim.” Villefort thus forestalled any danger of an inquiry, which,\nhowever improbable it might be, if it did take place would leave him\ndefenceless.\n\n“But how shall I address the minister?”\n\n“Sit down there,” said Villefort, giving up his place to Morrel, “and\nwrite what I dictate.”\n\n“Will you be so good?”\n\n“Certainly. But lose no time; we have lost too much already.”\n\n“That is true. Only think what the poor fellow may even now be\nsuffering.”\n\nVillefort shuddered at the suggestion; but he had gone too far to draw\nback. Dantès must be crushed to gratify Villefort’s ambition.\n\nVillefort dictated a petition, in which, from an excellent intention,\nno doubt, Dantès’ patriotic services were exaggerated, and he was made\nout one of the most active agents of Napoleon’s return. It was evident\nthat at the sight of this document the minister would instantly release\nhim. The petition finished, Villefort read it aloud.\n\n“That will do,” said he; “leave the rest to me.”\n\n“Will the petition go soon?”\n\n“Today.”\n\n“Countersigned by you?”\n\n“The best thing I can do will be to certify the truth of the contents\nof your petition.” And, sitting down, Villefort wrote the certificate\nat the bottom.\n\n“What more is to be done?”\n\n“I will do whatever is necessary.” This assurance delighted Morrel, who\ntook leave of Villefort, and hastened to announce to old Dantès that he\nwould soon see his son.\n\nAs for Villefort, instead of sending to Paris, he carefully preserved\nthe petition that so fearfully compromised Dantès, in the hopes of an\nevent that seemed not unlikely,—that is, a second restoration. Dantès\nremained a prisoner, and heard not the noise of the fall of Louis\nXVIII.’s throne, or the still more tragic destruction of the empire.\n\nTwice during the Hundred Days had Morrel renewed his demand, and twice\nhad Villefort soothed him with promises. At last there was Waterloo,\nand Morrel came no more; he had done all that was in his power, and any\nfresh attempt would only compromise himself uselessly.\n\nLouis XVIII. remounted the throne; Villefort, to whom Marseilles had\nbecome filled with remorseful memories, sought and obtained the\nsituation of king’s procureur at Toulouse, and a fortnight afterwards\nhe married Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran, whose father now stood higher\nat court than ever.\n\nAnd so Dantès, after the Hundred Days and after Waterloo, remained in\nhis dungeon, forgotten of earth and heaven.\n\nDanglars comprehended the full extent of the wretched fate that\noverwhelmed Dantès; and, when Napoleon retu", "label": "CONTRADICT"}

I cannot hope to be very fluent, but I\ncertainly should have no difficulty in explaining my wants and wishes;\nand that would be quite as much as I should ever require.”\n\nStronger grew the wonder of Dantès, who almost fancied he had to do\nwith one gifted with supernatural powers; still hoping to find some\nimperfection which might bring him down to a level with human beings,\nhe added, “Then if you were not furnished with pens, how did you manage\nto write the work you speak of?”\n\n“I made myself some excellent ones, which would be universally\npreferred to all others if once known.

Kai-Koumou came out of his house, and, surrounded by\nthe principal warriors of his tribe, took his place on a mound several\nfeet high in the centre of the fortification. The crowd of natives\nformed a semicircle around him, and the whole assembly preserved\nabsolute silence.\n\nAt a sign from the chief, a warrior advanced towards the temple.\n\n\"Remember!\" said Lady Helena to her husband.\n\nGlenarvan clasped his wife to his heart.

Lady Helena\nand Mary Grant raised towards heaven a look of thankfulness.\n\nThe captives were not taken back to the temple. They were to attend\nthat day the funeral of the dead chief, and the bloody ceremonies\nconnected therewith. A party of natives conducted them to the foot of\nan enormous koudi, where these guardians remained without losing sight\nof their prisoners.

This\nbeautiful creature was called Thaouka, which means \"bird\" in the\nPatagonian language, and he justly merited this appellation.\n\n[Sidenote: A FRESH START.]\n\nWhen Thalcave was in the saddle, the horse pranced with spirited grace,\nand the Patagonian, a skillful rider, was magnificent to behold. His\noutfit comprised two weapons of the chase, the \"bolas\" and the lasso.\nThe bolas consists of three balls tied together by a leathern string,\nwhich are fastened to the front of the saddle. The Indians frequently\nthrow them the distance of a hundred paces at the animal or enemy that\nthey are pursuing, and with such precision that they twist about their\nlegs and bring them to the ground. It is, therefore, in their hands a\nformidable instrument, and they handle it with surprising dexterity.\nThe lasso, on the contrary, does not leave the hand that wields it. It\nconsists simply of a leathern thong thirty feet in length, terminating\nin a slip-noose which works upon an iron ring. The right hand throws\nthe slip-noose, while the left hand holds the remainder of the lasso,\nthe end of which is firmly tied to the saddle. A long carbine in a\nsling completed the Patagonian's armament.\n\nThalcave, without observing the admiration caused by his natural\ngrace, ease and courage, took the lead, and the party advanced, now\nat a gallop, and now at a walk, for their horses seemed entirely\nunaccustomed to trotting. Robert mounted with much boldness, and\nspeedily convinced Glenarvan of his ability to keep his seat.\n\nOn issuing from the gorges of the Andes, they encountered a great\nnumber of sand-ridges, called \"medanos,\" real waves incessantly\nagitated by the wind, when the roots of the herbage did not confine\nthem to the earth. This sand is of an extreme fineness; and, at the\nleast breath, they saw it float away in light clouds, or form regular\nsand-columns which rose to a considerable height. This spectacle caused\npleasure as well as annoyance to the eyes. Pleasure, for nothing was\nmore curious than these columns, wandering over the plain, struggling,\nmingling, sinking and rising in inexpressible confusion; and annoyance,\nsince an impalpable dust emanated from these innumerable medanos and\npenetrated the eyelids, however tightly they were closed.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThis phenomenon continued during a great part of the day.

Masses of vapor, generated by the high temperature\nof the preceding days, condensed into thick clouds and threatened to\ndissolve in showers of rain. Moreover, the proximity of the Atlantic,\nand the west wind, which here reigns supreme, rendered the climate of\nthis region peculiarly moist. However, for that day at least the heavy\nclouds did not break; and at evening the horses, after traveling forty\nmiles, halted on the edge of a deep \"cañada,\" an immense natural ditch\nfilled with water. A shelter was wanting, but the ponchos served for\ntents as well as clothing, and peaceful slumbers enwrapped all.\n\nThe next day, as they progressed farther, the presence of subterranean\nstreams betrayed itself more noticeably, and moisture was seen in every\ndepression of the ground. Soon they came to large ponds, some already\ndeep and others just forming. So long as there were only lagoons, the\nhorses could easily extricate themselves; but with these treacherous\nswamps it was more difficult. Tall grass obstructed them, and it was\nnecessary to incur the danger before it could be understood. These\nquagmires had been already fatal to more than one human being.\n\nRobert, who had ridden half a mile in advance, returned at a gallop,\ncrying,--\n\n\"Monsieur Paganel! Monsieur Paganel! A forest of horns!\"\n\n\"What!\" replied the geographer, \"have you found a forest of horns?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes; or at least a field.\"\n\n\"A field! you are dreaming, my boy,\" said Paganel, shrugging his\nshoulders.\n\n\"I am not dreaming,\" retorted Robert; \"you shall see for yourself. This\nis a strange country! People sow horns, and they spring up like corn! I\nshould like very well to have some of the seed.\"\n\n\"But he speaks seriously,\" said the major.\n\n\"Yes, major, you shall see.\"\n\nRobert was not mistaken, and soon they found themselves before a vast\nfield of horns, regularly planted.\n\n\"Well?\" said Robert.\n\n\"This is something singular,\" replied Paganel, turning towards the\nIndian with a questioning look.\n\n[Sidenote: AN ANXIOUS INDIAN.]\n\n\"The horns come from the ground,\" explained Thalcave; \"and the cattle\nare under it.\"\n\n\"What!\" cried Paganel, \"is there a whole drove in this mire?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered the Patagonian.\n\nIn fact, a vast herd had perished in this bog, which had given way\nbeneath them. Hundreds of cattle had thus met their death, side by\nside, by suffocation in this vast quagmire. This circumstance, which\nsometimes takes place on the plains, could not be ignored by the\nIndian, and it was a warning which it was proper to heed. They passed\naround this immense hecatomb, which would have satisfied the most\nexacting gods of antiquity; and an hour after the field of horns was\nfar behind.\n\nThalcave now began to observe with an anxious air the state of things\naround him. He frequently stopped, and rose in his stirrups. His tall\nform enabled him to survey a wide range; but, perceiving nothing that\ncould enlighten him, he resumed his undeviating course. A mile farther,\nhe stopped again, and, turning from the beaten track, proceeded a short\ndistance, first to the north, then to the south, and then resumed his\nplace at the head of the party, without saying either what he hoped or\nwhat he feared.\n\nThese manoeuvres, many times repeated, puzzled Paganel and annoyed\nGlenarvan. The geographer was accordingly requested to interrogate\nthe Indian, which he did at once. Thalcave replied that he was\nastonished to see the plain so soaked with moisture. Never within his\nrecollection, since he had performed the office of guide, had his feet\ntrodden a soil so saturated. Even in the season of the great rains ", "label": "NEUTRAL"}

The last act of the funeral was played with the usual rites.\n\nThe bodies of Kara-Tété and his wife were taken up, and their limbs\nbent and gathered against the stomach, according to the New Zealand\ncustom. The place for the tomb had been chosen outside of the\nfortification, about two miles distant, on the summit of a small\nmountain, called Maunganamu, situated on the right shore of the lake.\n\nThither the bodies were to be carried. Two very rude palanquins, or\nrather litters, were brought to the foot of the mound. The corpses,\nfolded together, in a sitting posture, and tied in their clothes by a\ngirdle of withes, were placed on this primitive bier. Four warriors\nbore it between them, and the entire tribe, chanting the funeral hymn,\nfollowed them in procession to the place of burial.\n\nThe captives, who were always watched, saw them leave the inner\ninclosure of the pah, and then the songs and cries gradually died away.\nFor about half an hour this funeral escort continued in sight, in the\ndepths of the valley.

The distance gave a fantastic appearance to the\nundulating movements of the long, sinuous column.\n\nThe tribe stopped at the summit of the mountain, which was eight\nhundred feet high, at the place prepared for Kara-Tété's interment.\nA common Maori would have had only a hole and a heap of stones for a\ngrave; but for a powerful and dreaded chief, destined doubtless for a\nspeedy deification, a tomb worthy of his exploits was reserved.\n\n[Sidenote: THE LAST NIGHT.]\n\nThe sepulchre had been surrounded by palisades, while stakes,\nornamented with faces reddened with ochre, stood beside the grave\nwhere the bodies were to lie. The relatives had not forgotten that the\n\"waidoua\" (the spirit of the dead) feeds on substantial nourishment\nlike the body during this perishable life. Food had therefore been\ndeposited in the inclosure, together with the weapons and clothes of\nthe deceased.\n\nNothing was wanting for the comfort of the tomb.

He understood, however, that if they kept no definite\ncourse over the Pampas, they would not come to cities or villages.\nEvery morning they advanced towards the rising sun, without deviating\nfrom the straight line, and every evening the setting sun was behind\nthem. In his capacity of guide, Thalcave must, therefore, have been\nastonished to see that not only he did not guide them, but that they\nguided him. Nevertheless, if he was astonished, with the reserve\nnatural to the Indians he made no remark. But to-day arriving at the\nabove-mentioned road, he stopped his horse, and turned towards Paganel.\n\n\"Road to Carmen,\" said he.\n\n\"Yes, my good Patagonian,\" replied the geographer, in his purest\nSpanish; \"road to Carmen and Mendoza.\"\n\n\"We do not take it?\" resumed Thalcave.\n\n\"No,\" answered Paganel.\n\n\"And we are going----?\"\n\n\"Always to the east.\"\n\n\"That is going nowhere.\"\n\n\"Who knows?\"\n\nThalcave was silent, and gazed at the geographer with profound\nsurprise.

He gesticulated,\narticulated, and exerted himself in a hundred ways, while great\ndrops of sweat rolled down his face. When his tongue could no longer\nmove, his arm came to his aid. He dismounted, and traced on the\nsand a geographical map, with lines of latitude and longitude, the\ntwo oceans, and the road to Carmen. Never was professor in such\nembarrassment. Thalcave watched these manoeuvres without showing whether\nhe comprehended or not.\n\nThe lesson in geography lasted more than half an hour. At last Paganel\nceased, wiped his face, which was wet with perspiration, and looked at\nthe Patagonian.\n\n\"Did he understand?\" inquired Glenarvan.\n\n\"We shall see,\" replied Paganel; \"but, if he did not, I give it up.\"\n\n[Sidenote: \"PERHAPS!\"]\n\nThalcave did not stir.

A few boldly-struck chords wafted\nto his ears their harmonious vibrations. He could not be mistaken.\n\n\"A piano in the desert!\" said he to himself. \"It cannot be!\"\n\nIt was indeed very surprising, and Paganel began to think that some\nstrange Australian bird was imitating the sound of the instrument.\n\n[Sidenote: A TWOFOLD SURPRISE.]\n\nBut at that moment a voice, harmoniously pitched, was heard. The\npianist was accompanied by a vocalist. The geographer listened\nincredulously, but in a few moments was forced to recognize the\nsublime air that struck upon his ear.

There were thirty-five miles more to travel before they were\nout of Chili.\n\nThe country had not changed. It was still rich in amaryllis, violets,\ndate-trees, and golden-flowered cactuses. A few animals, among\nothers the ocelot, inhabited the thickets. A heron, a solitary owl,\nthrushes and snipes wary of the talons of the hawk, were the only\nrepresentatives of the feathered tribe.\n\nOf the natives few were seen; only some \"guassos\" (degenerate children\nof the Indians and Spanish), galloping on horses which they lacerated\nwith the gigantic spurs that adorned their naked feet, and passing\nlike shadows. They met on the way no one who could inform them, and\ninquiries were therefore utterly impossible.\n\n[Sidenote: AN ASTONISHED CATAPAZ.]\n\nGlenarvan thought that Captain Grant, if prisoner of the Indians, must\nhave been carried by them beyond the Andes.

Nothing betokened\nthat the man knew anything of what had occurred. He went on his way.\n\nDantès was then seized with an indescribable desire to know what was\ngoing on in the dungeon of his unfortunate friend. He therefore\nreturned by the subterraneous gallery, and arrived in time to hear the\nexclamations of the turnkey, who called out for help. Other turnkeys\ncame, and then was heard the regular tramp of soldiers.

In his capacity of guide, Thalcave must, therefore, have been\nastonished to see that not only he did not guide them, but that they\nguided him. Nevertheless, if he was astonished, with the reserve\nnatural to the Indians he made no remark.

He dismounted, and traced on the\nsand a geographical map, with lines of latitude and longitude, the\ntwo oceans, and the road to Carmen. Never was professor in such\nembarrassment. Thalcave watched these manoeuvres without showing whether\nhe comprehended or not.\n\nThe lesson in geography lasted more than half an hour.

I suppose, had he found another additional vertebra, they\nwould have made him a commander.”\n\n“Very likely,” said Albert.\n\n“And who can that person be who has taken it into his head to wrap\nhimself up in a blue coat embroidered with green?”\n\n“Oh, that coat is not his own idea; it is the Republic’s, which deputed\nDavid12 to devise a uniform for the Academicians.”\n\n“Indeed?” said Monte Cristo; “so this gentleman is an Academician?”\n\n“Within the last week he has been made one of the learned assembly.”\n\n“And what is his especial talent?”\n\n“His talent? I believe he thrusts pins through the heads of rabbits, he\nmakes fowls eat madder, and punches the spinal marrow out of dogs with\nwhalebone.”\n\n“And he is made a member of the Academy of Sciences for this?”\n\n“No; of the French Academy.”\n\n“But what has the French Academy to do with all this?”\n\n“I was going to tell you. It seems——”\n\n“That his experiments have very considerably advanced the cause of\nscience, doubtless?”\n\n“No; that his style of writing is very good.”\n\n“This must be very flattering to the feelings of the rabbits into whose\nheads he has thrust pins, to the fowls whose bones he has dyed red, and\nto the dogs whose spinal marrow he has punched out?”\n\nAlbert laughed.\n\n“And the other one?” demanded the count.\n\n“That one?”\n\n“Yes, the third.”\n\n“The one in the dark blue coat?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“He is a colleague of the count, and one of the most active opponents\nto the idea of providing the Chamber of Peers with a uniform. He was\nvery successful upon that question. He stood badly with the Liberal\npapers, but his noble opposition to the wishes of the court is now\ngetting him into favor with the journalists. They talk of making him an\nambassador.”\n\n30303m\n\n\n\n“And what are his claims to the peerage?”\n\n“He has composed two or three comic operas, written four or five\narticles in the _Siècle_, and voted five or six years on the\nministerial side.”\n\n“Bravo, viscount,” said Monte Cristo, smiling; “you are a delightful\n_cicerone_. And now you will do me a favor, will you not?”\n\n“What is it?”\n\n“Do not introduce me to any of these gentlemen; and should they wish\nit, you will warn me.” Just then the count felt his arm pressed. He\nturned round; it was Danglars.\n\n“Ah! is it you, baron?” said he.\n\n“Why do you call me baron?” said Danglars; “you know that I care\nnothing for my title. I am not like you, viscount; you like your title,\ndo you not?”\n\n“Certainly,” replied Albert, “seeing that without my title I should be\nnothing; while you, sacrificing the baron, would still remain the\nmillionaire.”\n\n“Which seems to me the finest title under the royalty of July,” replied\nDanglars.\n\n“Unfortunately,” said Monte Cristo, “one’s title to a millionaire does\nnot last for life, like that of baron, peer of France, or academician;\nfor example, the millionaires Franck & Poulmann, of Frankfurt, who have\njust become bankrupts.”\n\n“Indeed?” said Danglars, becoming pale.\n\n“Yes; I received the news this evening by a courier.

The poor beasts, feeling\ntheir strength renewed, rushed forward with an irresistible eagerness.\nIn a few moments they had reached the Guamini River, and, saddled as\nthey were, plunged to their breasts into the cooling stream.

The situation was excellent for the purpose, so long\nas one did not fear to sleep in the open air; and that was the least\nanxiety of Thalcave's companions.

Would you like a proof of it? well,\nyou wished to conceal your journey from me, and yet I knew of your\narrival half an hour after you had passed the barrier.

Ring,\nthen, if you please, for a second knife, fork, and plate, and we will\ndine together.”\n\n“Indeed!” replied Villefort, looking at his father with astonishment,\n“you really do seem very well informed.”\n\n“Eh? the thing is simple enough. You who are in power have only the\nmeans that money produces—we who are in expectation, have those which\ndevotion prompts.”\n\n“Devotion!” said Villefort, with a sneer.\n\n“Yes, devotion; for that is, I believe, the phrase for hopeful\nambition.”\n\nAnd Villefort’s father extended his hand to the bell-rope, to summon\nthe servant whom his son had not called. Villefort caught his arm.\n\n“Wait, my dear father,” said the young man, “one word more.”\n\n“Say on.”\n\n“However stupid the royalist police may be, they do know one terrible\nthing.”\n\n“What is that?”\n\n“The description of the man who, on the morning of the day when General\nQuesnel disappeared, presented himself at his house.”\n\n“Oh, the admirable police have found that out, have they?

Villefort watched him with alarm not devoid of admiration.\n\nHis whiskers cut off, Noirtier gave another turn to his hair; took,\ninstead of his black cravat, a colored neckerchief which lay at the top\nof an open portmanteau; put on, in lieu of his blue and high-buttoned\nfrock-coat, a coat of Villefort’s of dark brown, and cut away in front;\ntried on before the glass a narrow-brimmed hat of his son’s, which\nappeared to fit him perfectly, and, leaving his cane in the corner\nwhere he had deposited it, he took up a small bamboo switch, cut the\nair with it once or twice, and walked about with that easy swagger\nwhich was one of his principal characteristics.\n\n“Well,” he said, turning towards his wondering son, when this disguise\nwas completed, “well, do you think your police will recognize me now.”\n\n“No, father,” stammered Villefort; “at least, I hope not.”\n\n“And now, my dear boy,” continued Noirtier, “I rely on your prudence to\nremove all the things which I leave in your care.”\n\n“Oh, rely on me,” said Villefort.\n\n“Yes, yes; and now I believe you are right, and that you have really\nsaved my life; be assured I will return the favor hereafter.”\n\nVillefort shook his head.\n\n“You are not convinced yet?”\n\n“I hope at least, that you may be mistaken.”\n\n“Shall you see the king again?”\n\n“Perhaps.”\n\n“Would you pass in his eyes for a prophet?”\n\n“Prophets of evil are not in favo", "label": "CONTRADICT"}

Villefort fully understood his father’s meaning, and answered\nby a slight shrug of his shoulders. He then motioned to his wife to\ntake leave.\n\n“Now sir,” said Madame de Villefort, “I must bid you farewell. Would\nyou like me to send Edward to you for a short time?”\n\nIt had been agreed that the old man should express his approbation by\nclosing his eyes, his refusal by winking them several times, and if he\nhad some desire or feeling to express, he raised them to heaven. If he\nwanted Valentine, he closed his right eye only, and if Barrois, the\nleft. At Madame de Villefort’s proposition he instantly winked his\neyes.\n\nProvoked by a complete refusal, she bit her lip and said, “Then shall I\nsend Valentine to you?” The old man closed his eyes eagerly, thereby\nintimating that such was his wish.\n\nM. and Madame de Villefort bowed and left the room, giving orders that\nValentine should be summoned to her grandfather’s presence, and feeling\nsure that she would have much to do to restore calmness to the\nperturbed spirit of the invalid. Valentine, with a color still\nheightened by emotion, entered the room just after her parents had\nquitted it. One look was sufficient to tell her that her grandfather\nwas suffering, and that there was much on his mind which he was wishing\nto communicate to her.\n\n“Dear grandpapa,” cried she, “what has happened?

I do assure you, grandpapa—Ah—M. and Madame de\nVillefort have just left this room, have they not?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“And it was they who told you something which made you angry? What was\nit then? May I go and ask them, that I may have the opportunity of\nmaking my peace with you?”\n\n“No, no,” said Noirtier’s look.\n\n“Ah, you frighten me. What can they have said?” and she again tried to\nthink what it could be.\n\n“Ah, I know,” said she, lowering her voice and going close to the old\nman. “They have been speaking of my marriage,—have they not?”\n\n“Yes,” replied the angry look.\n\n“I understand; you are displeased at the silence I have preserved on\nthe subject. The reason of it was, that they had insisted on my keeping\nthe matter a secret, and begged me not to tell you anything of it. They\ndid not even acquaint me with their intentions, and I only discovered\nthem by chance, that is why I have been so reserved with you, dear\ngrandpapa.

Lady Helena and Mary Grant, while the boat was approaching\nthe ship, had experienced all the anguish of suspense. From the deck\nthey endeavored to count those who were returning. At one time the\nyoung girl would despair; at another she would think she saw her\nfather. Her heart beat quickly; she could not speak; she could scarcely\nstand.

Glenarvan would\ngladly have put in a word in regard to his affairs, but the soldier\nwas telling his story, and was not in the mood to be interrupted.\nThis honest man had left France a long time before; and the native\nlanguage was no longer perfectly familiar to him: he had forgotten,\nif not words, at least the manner of combining them. As his visitors\nsoon learned, he had been a sergeant in the French army. Since the\nfoundation of the fort he had not left it, and commanded it by\nappointment from the Argentine government. He was by parentage a\nBasque, and his name was Manuel Ipharaguerre. A year after his arrival\nin the country, Sergeant Manuel was naturalized, joined the Argentine\narmy, and married an honest Indian woman, who had twins,--boys, to be\nsure, for the sergeant's worthy consort would never present him with\ndaughters. Manuel did not think of any other calling than that of the\nsoldier, and hoped, in time, with the help of God, to offer to the\nrepublic a whole battalion of young soldiers.\n\n\"You have seen them?\" said he. \"Charming fellows! Good soldiers! José!\nJuan! Miguel! Pepe! Pepe is only seven years old, and is already biting\nhis cartridge!\"\n\nPepe, hearing himself complimented, joined his two little feet, and\npresented arms with perfect precision.\n\n\"He will do!\" added the sergeant. \"He will be a major--or\nbrigadier-general one day!\"\n\nThis story lasted a quarter of an hour, to Thalcave's great\nastonishment. The Indian could not understand how so many words could\ncome from a single throat. No one interrupted the commander; and even\na French sergeant had to conclude at last, though not without forcing\nhis guests to accompany him to his dwelling. Here they were introduced\nto Madame Ipharaguerre, who appeared to be \"a good-looking person,\" if\nthis expression may be employed in regard to an Indian.\n\nWhen he had exhausted himself, the sergeant asked his guests to what he\nowed the honor of their visit. And now it was their turn to explain.\n\nPaganel, opening the conversation in French, told him of their journey\nacross the Pampas, and ended by asking why the Indians had abandoned\nthe country.\n\n\"War!\" replied the sergeant.\n\n\"War?\"\n\n\"Yes, civil war.\"\n\n\"Civil war?\" rejoined Paganel.\n\n\"Yes, war between Paraguay and Buenos Ayres,\" answered the sergeant.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Why, all the Indians of the north are in the rear of General Flores,\nand those of the plains are plundering.\"\n\n\"But the caziques?\"\n\n\"The caziques with them.\"\n\nThis answer was reported to Thalcave, who shook his head. Indeed,\nhe either did not know, or had forgotten, that a civil war, which\nwas afterwards to involve Brazil, was decimating two-thirds of the\nrepublic. The Indians had everything to gain in these internal\nstruggles, and could not neglect such fine opportunities for plunder.\nThe sergeant, therefore, was not mistaken in attributing this desertion\nof the Pampas to the civil war that was being waged in the northern\npart of the Argentine Provinces.\n\nBut this event disconcerted Glenarvan's hopes. If Captain Grant was\na prisoner of the caziques, he must have been carried by them to the\nnorthern frontiers. Yet how and where to find him? Must they attempt\na perilous and almost useless search to the northern limits of the\nPampas? It was a serious matter, which was to be earnestly considered.\n\nHowever, one important question was still to be asked of the sergeant,\nand the major thought of this, while his companions were looking at\neach other in silence.\n\n\"Hav", "label": "SUPPORT"}

One of the sailors at once approached him, not without caution,\nand with a vigorous blow of the hatchet cut off the formidable tail of\nthe animal.\n\nThe chase was ended, and there was nothing more to fear from the\nmonster. The vengeance of the sailors was satisfied, but not their\ncuriosity. Indeed, it is customary on board of every vessel to\ncarefully examine the stomachs of sharks.

The shark was still panting. He was ten feet\nlong, and weighed more than six hundred pounds. These dimensions are\nnothing extraordinary; for if the balance-fish is not classed among the\ngiants of this species, at least he belongs to the most formidable of\ntheir family.\n\nThe enormous fish was soon cut open by a blow of the hatchet, without\nfurther ceremony. The hook had penetrated to the stomach, which was\nabsolutely empty.

Bottles found in\nthe sea frequently contain precious documents.\"\n\n\"Do you think so?\" said Major MacNabb.\n\n\"I do; at least, that it may happen so.\"\n\n\"Oh! I do not contradict you,\" replied the major. \"Perhaps there may be\na secret in this.\"\n\n\"We shall see,\" said Glenarvan. \"Well, Tom?\"\n\n\"Here it is,\" said the mate, displaying the shapeless object that he\nhad just drawn with difficulty from the interior of the shark.\n\n\"Good,\" said Glenarvan; \"wash the dirty thing, and bring it into the\ncabin.\"\n\nTom obeyed; and the bottle found under such singular circumstances was\nplaced on the cabin-table, around which Lord Glenarvan, Major MacNabb,\nand Captain John Mangles took their seats, together with Lady Helena;\nfor a woman, they say, is always a little inquisitive.\n\nEverything causes excitement at sea.

These were\nreserved for the captives who stood trembling not twenty paces distant.\nSix blows of the méré, given by six stalwart warriors, stretched the\nvictims on the ground in a pool of blood. It was the signal for a\nterrible scene of cannibalism, which followed in all its horrible\ndetails.\n\nGlenarvan and his companions, breathless with fright, strove to hide\nthis awful scene from the eyes of the two unhappy ladies. They now\nunderstood what awaited them at sunrise the next day, and what cruel\ntortures would doubtless precede such a death. They were dumb with\nhorror.\n\nThe funeral dance now began.

The major accordingly undertook the\npart of Cupid's messenger between these two congenial hearts, and even\ntold Paganel that marriage was \"the last blunder\" that he could commit.\nBut the geographer was very much embarrassed, and, strangely enough,\ncould not summon courage to speak for himself.\n\n[Illustration: Early in the afternoon the travelers reached Malcolm\nCastle, amidst the hurrahs of their tenantry and friends.]\n\n\"Does not Miss Arabella please you?\" MacNabb would say to him.\n\n\"Oh, major, she is charming!\" cried Paganel,--\"a thousand times too\ncharming for me; and, if I must tell you, would please me better if she\nwere less so.

But remorse is not\nthus banished; like Virgil’s wounded hero, he carried the arrow in his\nwound, and, arrived at the salon, Villefort uttered a sigh that was\nalmost a sob, and sank into a chair.\n\nThen the first pangs of an unending torture seized upon his heart. The\nman he sacrificed to his ambition, that innocent victim immolated on\nthe altar of his father’s faults, appeared to him pale and threatening,\nleading his affianced bride by the hand, and bringing with him remorse,\nnot such as the ancients figured, furious and terrible, but that slow\nand consuming agony whose pangs are intensified from hour to hour up to\nthe very moment of death. Then he had a moment’s hesitation. He had\nfrequently called for capital punishment on criminals, and owing to his\nirresistible eloquence they had been condemned, and yet the slightest\nshadow of remorse had never clouded Villefort’s brow, because they were\nguilty; at least, he believed so; but here was an innocent man whose\nhappiness he had destroyed. In this case he was not the judge, but the\nexecutioner.\n\nAs he thus reflected, he felt the sensation we have described, and\nwhich had hitherto been unknown to him, arise in his bosom, and fill\nhim with vague apprehensions. It is thus that a wounded man trembles\ninstinctively at the approach of the finger to his wound until it be\nhealed, but Villefort’s was one of those that never close, or if they\ndo, only close to reopen more agonizing than ever. If at this moment\nthe sweet voice of Renée had sounded in his ears pleading for mercy, or\nthe fair Mercédès had entered and said, “In the name of God, I conjure\nyou to restore me my affianced husband,” his cold and trembling hands\nwould have signed his release; but no voice broke the stillness of the\nchamber, and the door was opened only by Villefort’s valet, who came to\ntell him that the travelling carriage was in readiness.\n\nVillefort rose, or rather sprang, from his chair, hastily opened one of\nthe drawers of his desk, emptied all the gold it contained into his\npocket, stood motionless an instant, his hand pressed to his head,\nmuttered a few inarticulate sounds, and then, perceiving that his\nservant had placed his cloak on his shoulders, he sprang into the\ncarriage, ordering the postilions to drive to M. de Saint-Méran’s. The\nhapless Dantès was doomed.\n\nAs the marquis had promised, Villefort found the marquise and Renée in\nwaiting. He started when he saw Renée, for he fancied she was again\nabout to plead for Dantès. Alas, her emotions were wholly personal: she\nwas thinking only of Villefort’s departure.\n\nShe loved Villefort, and he left her at the moment he was about to\nbecome her husband. Villefort knew not when he should return, and\nRenée, far from pleading for Dantès, hated the man whose crime\nseparated her from her lover.\n\n0127m\n\n\n\nMeanwhile what of Mercédès?

He embraced his weeping wife and daughter, pressed Emmanuel’s\nhand with friendly warmth, and then going to his private room on the\nsecond floor had sent for Cocles.\n\n“Then,” said the two women to Emmanuel, “we are indeed ruined.”\n\nIt was agreed in a brief council held among them, that Julie should\nwrite to her brother, who was in garrison at Nîmes, to come to them as\nspeedily as possible. The poor women felt instinctively that they\nrequired all their strength to support the blow that impended. Besides,\nMaximilian Morrel, though hardly two-and-twenty, had great influence\nover his father.\n\nHe was a strong-minded, upright young man. At the time when he decided\non his profession his father had no desire to choose for him, but had\nconsulted young Maximilian’s taste. He had at once declared for a\nmilitary life, and had in consequence studied hard, passed brilliantly\nthrough the Polytechnic School, and left it as sub-lieutenant of the\n53rd of the line. For a year he had held this rank, and expected\npromotion on the first vacancy. In his regiment Maximilian Morrel was\nnoted for his rigid observance, not only of the obligations imposed on\na soldier, but also of the duties of a man; and he thus gained the name\nof “the stoic.” We need hardly say that many of those who gave him this\nepithet repeated it because they had heard it, and did not even know\nwhat it meant.\n\nThis was the young man whom his mother and sister called to their aid\nto sustain them under the serious trial which they felt they would soon\nhave to endure. They had not mistaken the gravity of this event, for\nthe moment after Morrel had entered his private office with Cocles,\nJulie saw the latter leave it pale, trembling, and his features\nbetraying the utmost consternation. She would have questioned him as he\npassed by her, but the worthy creature hastened down the staircase with\nunusual precipitation, and only raised his hands to heaven and\nexclaimed:\n\n“Oh, mademoiselle, mademoiselle, what a dreadful misfortune! Who could\never have believed it!”\n\nA moment afterwards Julie saw him go upstairs carrying two or three\nheavy ledgers, a portfolio, and a bag of money.\n\nMorrel examined the ledgers, opened the portfolio, and counted the\nmoney. All his funds amounted to 6,000 or 8,000 francs, his bills\nreceivable up to the 5th to 4,000 or 5,000, which, making the best of\neverything, gave him 14,000 francs to meet debts amounting to 287,500\nfrancs. He had not even the means for making a possible settlement on\naccount.\n\nHowever, when Morrel went down to his dinner, he appeared very calm.\nThis calmness was more alarming to the two women than the deepest\ndejection would have been. After dinner Morrel usually went out and\nused to take his coffee at the club of the Phocéens, and read the\n_Semaphore_; this day he did not leave the house, but returned to his\noffice.\n\nAs to Cocles, he seemed completely bewildered. For part of the day he\nwent into the courtyard, seated himself on a stone with his head bare\nand exposed to the blazing sun. Emmanuel tried to comfort the women,\nbut his eloquence faltered. The young man was too well acquainted with\nthe business of the house, not to feel that a great catastrophe hung\nover the Morrel family. Night came, the two women had watched, hoping\nthat when he left his room Morrel would come to them, but they heard\nhim pass before their door, and trying to conceal the noise of his\nfootsteps. They listened; he went into his sleeping-room, and fastened\nthe door inside. Madame Morrel sent her daughter to bed, and half an\nhour after", "label": "NEUTRAL"}

A rope with a slip-noose\nconfined his tail and paralyzed his movements. A few moments afterward\nhe was hauled over the ratlings, and precipitated upon the deck of the\nyacht. One of the sailors at once approached him, not without caution,\nand with a vigorous blow of the hatchet cut off the formidable tail of\nthe animal.\n\nThe chase was ended, and there was nothing more to fear from the\nmonster. The vengeance of the sailors was satisfied, but not their\ncuriosity. Indeed, it is customary on board of every vessel to\ncarefully examine the stomachs of sharks. The men, knowing the\ninordinate voracity of the creature, wait with some anxiety, and their\nexpectation is not always in vain.\n\nLady Glenarvan, not wishing to witness this strange \"exploration,\"\nretired to the cabin. The shark was still panting. He was ten feet\nlong, and weighed more than six hundred pounds. These dimensions are\nnothing extraordinary; for if the balance-fish is not classed among the\ngiants of this species, at least he belongs to the most formidable of\ntheir family.\n\nThe enormous fish was soon cut open by a blow of the hatchet, without\nfurther ceremony. The hook had penetrated to the stomach, which was\nabsolutely empty. Evidently the animal had fasted a long time, and\nthe disappointed seamen were about to cast the remains into the sea,\nwhen the attention of the mate was attracted by a bulky object firmly\nimbedded in the viscera.\n\n\"Ha! what is this?\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"That,\" replied one of the sailors, \"is a piece of rock that the\ncreature has taken in for ballast.\"\n\n\"Good!\" said another; \"it is probably a bullet that this fellow has\nreceived in the stomach, and could not digest.\"\n\n[Illustration: \"Good,\" said Glenarvan; \"wash the dirty thing, and bring\nit into the cabin.\"]\n\n\"Be still, all of you!\" cried Tom Austin, the mate; \"do you not see\nthat the animal was a great drunkard? and to lose nothing, has drank\nnot only the wine, but the bottle too!\"\n\n\"What!\" exclaimed Lord Glenarvan, \"is it a bottle that this shark has\nin his stomach?\"\n\n\"A real bottle!\" replied the mate, \"but you can easily see that it does\nnot come from the wine-cellar.\"\n\n\"Well, Tom,\" said Glenarvan, \"draw it out carefully. Bottles found in\nthe sea frequently contain precious documents.\"\n\n\"Do you think so?\" said Major MacNabb.\n\n\"I do; at least, that it may happen so.\"\n\n\"Oh! I do not contradict you,\" replied the major. \"Perhaps there may be\na secret in this.\"\n\n\"We shall see,\" said Glenarvan. \"Well, Tom?\"\n\n\"Here it is,\" said the mate, displaying the shapeless object that he\nhad just drawn with difficulty from the interior of the shark.\n\n\"Good,\" said Glenarvan; \"wash the dirty thing, and bring it into the\ncabin.\"\n\nTom obeyed; and the bottle found under such singular circumstances was\nplaced on the cabin-table, around which Lord Glenarvan, Major MacNabb,\nand Captain John Mangles took their seats, together with Lady Helena;\nfor a woman, they say, is always a little inquisitive.\n\nEverything causes excitement at sea. For a moment there was silence.\nEach gazed wonderingly at this strange waif. Did it contain the secret\nof a disaster, or only an insignificant message confided to the mercy\nof the waves by some idle navigator?\n\n[Sidenote: \"OLD IN BOTTLE.\"]\n\nHowever, they must know what it was, and Glenarvan, without waiting\nlonger, proceeded to examine the bottle. He took, moreover, all\nnecessary precautions. You would have thought a coroner was pointing\nout the particulars of a suspicious quest. And Glenarvan was right,\nfor the most insignificant mark in appearance may often lead to an\nimportant discovery.\n\nBefore examining it internally, the bottle was inspected externally.\nIt had a slender neck, the mouth of which was protected by an\niron wire considerably rusted. Its sides were very thick, and\ncapable of supporting a pressure of several atmospheres, betraying\nevidently previous connection with champagne. With these ", "label": "CONTRADICT"}

Then the enormous\nbird reappeared, heavily laden, and rising slowly.\n\nA cry of horror was uttered. In the claws of the condor an inanimate\nbody was seen suspended and dangling. It was Robert Grant. The bird had\nraised him by his garments, and was now hovering in mid-air at least\none hundred and fifty feet above the encampment. He had perceived the\ntravelers, and was violently striving to escape with his heavy prey.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"May Robert's body be dashed upon these rocks,\" cried Glenarvan,\n\"rather than serve----\"\n\nHe did not finish, but, seizing Wilson's rifle, attempted to take aim\nat the condor.

But it must be confessed that these\nwell-meant embraces are not fatal, for the boy did not die.\n\nWhen his rescue was certain, thought reverted to his rescuer, and the\nmajor very naturally thought of looking around him. Fifty paces from\nthe stream, a man of lofty stature was standing, motionless, on one\nof the first ledges of the mountain. A long gun lay at his feet.

Five miles to the south a high and broad wall of water\nwas rushing over the plain, which was fast becoming an ocean. The tall\ngrass disappeared as before the scythe, and the tufts of mimosas, torn\nup by the current, separated and formed floating islands. The mass of\nwaters spread itself in broad waves of irresistible power. The dikes of\nthe great rivers had evidently given way, and perhaps the waters of the\nColorado and Rio Negro were now mingling in a common stream.\n\nThe wall of water descried by Thalcave advanced with the speed of a\nrace-horse. The travelers fled before it like a cloud driven by the\nstorm. Their eyes sought in vain a place of refuge. Sky and water\nmingled together on the horizon. The horses, excited by the danger,\ndashed along in a mad gallop, so that their riders could scarcely keep\ntheir seats. Glenarvan frequently glanced behind him.\n\n\"The water is overtaking us,\" he thought.\n\n\"Quick! quick!\" cried Thalcave.\n\n[Sidenote: THE ARK.]\n\nThe unfortunate beasts were urged to a swifter pace. From their flanks,\nlacerated with the spur, flowed bright red streams, which marked\ntheir course on the water by long, crimson lines. They stumbled in\nthe hollows of the ground; they were entangled in the hidden grass;\nthey fell and rose again continually. The depth of the water sensibly\nincreased. Long surges announced the on-rush of the mass of water that\ntossed its foaming crests less than two miles distant.\n\nFor a quarter of an hour this final struggle against the most terrible\nof elements was prolonged. The fugitives could keep no account of the\ndistance they had traversed; but, judging by the rapidity of their\nflight, it must have been considerable.\n\nMeantime the horses, immersed to their breasts, could no longer\nadvance without extreme difficulty. Glenarvan, Paganel, Austin, all\nbelieved themselves lost, victims of the horrible death of unfortunates\nabandoned at sea. Their animals began to lose their footing; six feet\nof water was sufficient to drown them.\n\nWe must forbear to picture the acute anguish of these eight men\novertaken by a rising inundation. They felt their powerlessness to\nstruggle against these convulsions of nature, superior to human\nstrength. Their safety was no longer in their own hands.\n\nFive minutes after, the horses were swimming, while the current alone\ncarried them along with irresistible force and furious swiftness. All\nsafety seemed impossible, when the voice of the major was heard.\n\n\"A tree!\" said he.\n\n\"A tree!\" cried Glenarvan.\n\n\"Yes, yonder!\" replied Thalcave, and he pointed northward to a kind of\ngigantic walnut-tree, which rose solitary from the midst of the waters.\n\nHis companions had no need to be urged. This tree that was opportunely\npresented to them they must reach at all hazards. The horses probably\ncould not accomplish the distance; but the men, at least, could be\nsaved,--the current would carry them.\n\nAt that moment Tom Austin's horse gave a stifled neigh and disappeared.\nHis rider, extricating himself from the stirrups, began to swim\nvigorously.\n\n\"Cling to my saddle!\" cried Glenarvan to him.\n\n\"Thanks, my lord,\" replied he, \"my arms are strong.\"\n\n\"Your horse, Robert?\" continued Glenarvan, turning towards the boy.\n\n\"All right, my lord, all right!

A ponderous liquid mass engulfed them in its furious\ntide. When the deluge had passed, the men regained the surface, and\nrapidly counted their numbers; but the horses, except Thaouka, had\ndisappeared forever.\n\n\"Courage! courage!\" cried Glenarvan, who supported Paganel with one arm\nand swam with the other.\n\n\"All right! all right!\" replied the worthy geographer; \"indeed I am not\nsorry----\"\n\nWhat was he not ", "label": "SUPPORT"}

Only a\ngood sleep could thoroughly refresh, after this eventful day. The\ninmates of the tree felt themselves not only fatigued by the sudden\nchanges of the inundation, but especially overcome by the heat, which\nhad been excessive. Their feathered companions had already set the\nexample; the hilgueros, those nightingales of the Pampas, had ceased\ntheir melodious warblings, and all the birds had disappeared in the\nrecesses of the foliage. The best plan was to imitate them.\n\nBut before \"retiring to their nest,\" as Paganel said, Glenarvan,\nRobert, and he climbed to the observatory, to examine for the last\ntime the watery expanse. It was about nine o'clock. The sun had just\nset in the sparkling mists of the horizon, and all the western part\nof the firmament was bathed in a warm vapor. The constellations,\nusually so dazzling, seemed veiled in a soft haze. Still they could\nbe distinguished, and Paganel pointed out to Robert, for Glenarvan's\nbenefit, that zone where the stars are most brilliant.\n\n[Sidenote: PHILOSOPHY AND PONCHOS.]\n\nWhile the geographer was discoursing thus, the whole eastern horizon\nassumed a stormy aspect. A dense and dark band, clearly defined,\ngradually rose, dimming the light of the stars. This cloud of\nthreatening appearance soon invaded almost the entire vault of the sky.\nIts motive power must have been inherent in itself, for there was not\na breath of wind. Not a leaf stirred on the tree, not a ripple curled\nthe surface of the waters. Even the air seemed to fail, as if some\nhuge pneumatic machine had rarefied it. A strong electric current was\nperceptible in the atmosphere, and every creature felt it course along\nthe nerves.

Captain Grant is not with us, but we are\nsure to find him.\"\n\nIt needed only such an assurance to restore hope to the passengers of\nthe Duncan. Lady Helena and Mary Grant, while the boat was approaching\nthe ship, had experienced all the anguish of suspense. From the deck\nthey endeavored to count those who were returning. At one time the\nyoung girl would despair; at another she would think she saw her\nfather. Her heart beat quickly; she could not speak; she could scarcely\nstand. Lady Helena supported her, while Captain Mangles stood beside\nher in silence. His keen eyes, accustomed to distinguish distant\nobjects, could not discern the captain.\n\n\"He is there! he is coming! my father!\" murmured the young girl.\n\nBut as the boat gradually drew near, the illusion vanished.

He was prisoner on this yacht that he had meant to\ncommand as master, and his fate was soon to be decided.\n\nHowever, he made no reply.

She\ncut the Tropic of Capricorn, and her prow was headed toward the strait\nof the celebrated geographer. Now and then the low shores of Patagonia\nwere seen, but like an almost invisible line on the horizon. They\nsailed along the coast for more than ten miles, but Paganel's famous\ntelescope gave him only a vague idea of these American shores.\n\nThe vessel soon found herself at the head of the strait, and entered\nwithout hesitation. This way is generally preferred by steam-vessels\nbound for the Pacific. Its exact length is three hundred and\nseventy-six miles. Ships of the greatest tonnage can always find deep\nwater, even near its shores, an excellent bottom, and many springs of\nwater. The rivers abound in fish, the forest in game, there are safe\nand easy landings at twenty places, and, in short, a thousand resources\nthat are wanting in the Strait of Lemaire, and off the terrible rocks\nof Cape Horn, which are continually visited by storms and tempests.\n\n[Illustration: Sometimes the tips of her yards would graze the branches\nof the beeches that hung over the waves.]\n\nDuring the first hours of the passage, till you reach Cape Gregory,\nthe shores are low and sandy. The entire passage lasted scarcely\nthirty-six hours, and this moving panorama of the two shores well\nrewarded the pains the geographer took to admire it under the radiant\nbeams of the southern sun. No inhabitant appeared on the shores of the\ncontinent; and only a few Fuegians wandered along the barren rocks of\nTerra del Fuego.\n\nAt one moment the Duncan rounded the peninsula of Brunswick between\ntwo magnificent sights. Just here the strait cuts between stupendous\nmasses of granite. The base of the mountains was hidden in the heart\nof immense forests, while their summits, whitened with eternal snow,\nwere lost in the clouds. Towards the southeast Mount Taru towered\nsix thousand five hundred feet aloft. Night came, preceded by a long\ntwilight, the light melting away insensibly by gentle degrees, while\nthe sky was studded with brilliant stars.\n\nIn the midst of this partial obscurity, the yacht boldly continued on\nher course, without casting anchor in the safe bays with which the\nshores abound. Sometimes the tips of her yards would graze the branches\nof the beeches that hung over the waves. At others her propeller would\nbeat the waters of the great rivers, starting geese, ducks, snipe,\nteal, and all the feathered tribes of the marshes. Soon deserted ruins\nappeared, and fallen monuments, to which the night lent a grand aspect;\nthese were the mournful remains of an abandoned colony, whose name\nwill be an eternal contradiction to the fertility of the coasts and\nthe rich game of the forests. It was Port Famine, the place that the\nSpaniard Sarmiento colonized in 1581 with four hundred emigrants. Here\nhe founded the city of San Felipe. But the extreme severity of the cold\nweakened the colony; famine devoured those whom the winter had spared,\nand in 1587 the explorer Cavendish found the last of these four hundred\nunfortunates dying of hunger amid the ruins of a city only six years in\nexistence.\n\n[Sidenote: CHEERLESS MEMORIES.]\n\nThe vessel coasted along these deserted shores. At daybreak she sailed\nin the midst of the narrow passes, between beeches, ash-trees, and\nbirches, from the bosom of which emerged ivy-clad domes, cupolas\ntapestried with the hardy holly, and lofty spires, among which the\nobelisk of Buckland rose to a great height. Far out in the sea sported\ndroves of seals and whales of great size, judging by their spouting,\nwhich could be seen at a distance of four miles. At last they doubled\nCape Froward, still bristling with the ices of winter.

Great blocks of glittering ice, of\na bluish color in certain parts, rose on all sides, and reflected the\nfirst rays of the sun.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe ascent now became very perilous. They no longer advanced without\ncarefully examining the ice. Wilson had taken the lead, and with his\nfoot tested the surface of the glaciers. His companions followed\nexactly in his footsteps, and avoided uttering a word, for the least\nsound might have caused the fall of the snowy masses suspended eight\nhundred feet above their heads.\n\nThey had reached the region of shrubs, which, four hundred and fifty\nfeet higher, gave place to grass and cactuses. At eleven thousand feet\nall traces of vegetation disappeared. The travelers had stopped only\nonce to recruit their strength by a hasty repast, and with superhuman\ncourage they resumed the ascent in the face of the ever-increasing\ndangers.\n\n[Illustration: Two hours more of terrible exertion followed. They kept\nascending, in order to reach the highest summit of this part of the\nmountain.]\n\n[Sidenote: SOMEWHAT SERIOUS.]\n\nThe strength of the little troop, however, in spite of their courage,\nwas almost gone. Glenarvan, seeing the exhaustion of his companions,\nregretted having engaged in the undertaking. Young Robert struggled\nagainst fatigue, but could go no farther.\n\nGlenarvan stopped.\n\n\"We must take a rest,\" said he, for he clearly saw that no one else\nwould make this proposal.\n\n\"Take a rest?\" replied Paganel; \"how? where? we have no shelter.\"\n\n\"It is indispensable, if only for Robert.\"\n\n\"No, my lord,\" replied the courageous child; \"I can still walk--do not\nstop.\"\n\n\"We will carry you, my boy,\" said Paganel, \"but we must, at all\nhazards, reach the eastern slope. There, perhaps, we shall find some\nhut in which we can take refuge. I ask for two hours more of travel.\"\n\n\"Do you all agree?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied his companions.\n\n\"I will take charge of the brave boy,\" added the equally brave Mulready.\n\nThey resumed their march towards the east. Two hours more of terrible\nexertion followed. They kept ascending, in order to reach the highest\nsummit of this part of the mountain.\n\nWhatever were the desires of these courageous men, the moment now came\nwhen the most valiant failed, and dizziness, that terrible malady of\nthe mountains, exhausted not only their physical strength but their\nmoral courage. It is impossible to struggle with impunity against\nfatigues of this kind. Soon falls became frequent, and those who fell\ncould only advance by dragging themselves on their knees.\n\nExhaustion was about to put an end to this too prolonged ascent; and\nGlenarvan was considering with terror the extent of the snow, the cold\nwhich in this fatal region was so much to be dreaded, the shadows that\nwere deepening on the solitary peaks, and the absence of a shelter for\nthe night, when the major stopped him, and, in a calm tone, said,--\n\n\"A hut!\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\nA SUDDEN DESCENT.\n\n\nAny one but MacNabb would have passed by, around, or even over this\nhut a hundred times without suspecting its existence.

Ten persons could easily find room inside,\nand, if its walls had not been sufficiently water-tight in the rainy\nseason, at this time, at least, they were some protection against the\nseverity of the cold. There was, besides, a sort of fireplace with a\nflue of bricks very poorly laid, which enabled them to kindle a fire,\nand thus withstand the external temperature.\n\n\"Here is a shelter, at least,\" said Glenarvan, \"even if it is not\ncomfortable.

Fire, my friends, fire!\"\n\nBut he was too late. The condor had disappeared behind the lofty\nboulders. A second passed that seemed an eternity. Then the enormous\nbird reappeared, heavily laden, and rising slowly.\n\nA cry of horror was uttered. In the claws of the condor an inanimate\nbody was seen suspended and dangling. It was Robert Grant. The bird had\nraised him by his garments, and was now hovering in mid-air at least\none hundred and fifty feet above the encampment. He had perceived the\ntravelers, and was violently striving to escape with his heavy prey.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"May Robert's body be dashed upon these rocks,\" cried Glenarvan,\n\"rather than serve----\"\n\nHe did not finish, but, seizing Wilson's rifle, attempted to take aim\nat the condor. But his arm trembled; he could not sight the piece. His\neyes were dimmed.\n\n\"Let me try,\" said the major.\n\nWith clear eye, steady hand, and motionless body, he aimed at the bird,\nthat was already three hundred feet above him. But he had not pressed\nthe trigger, when a report resounded in the valley. A light smoke\ncurled up between two rocks, and the condor, shot in the head, fell,\nslowly turning, sustained by his broad outspread wings. He had not\nreleased his prey, and at last reached the ground, ten paces from the\nbanks of the stream.\n\n\"Quick! quick!\" said Glenarvan; and without seeking whence this\nprovidential shot had come, he rushed towards the condor. His\ncompanions closely followed him.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Sidenote: \"THE LOST IS FOUND.\"]\n\nWhen they arrived the bird was dead, and the body of Robert was hidden\nunder its great wings. Glenarvan threw himself upon the child, released\nhim from the talons of the condor, stretched him on the grass, and\npressed his ear to his breast.\n\nNever did a wilder cry of joy issue from human lips than when Glenarvan\nrose, exclaiming:\n\n\"He lives! he lives!\"\n\nIn an instant Robert was stripped of his garments, and his face bathed\nwith fresh water. He made a movement, opened his eyes, looked around,\nand uttered a few words:\n\n\"You, my lord--my father!----\"\n\nGlenarvan could not speak. Emotion stifled him, and, kneeling, he wept\nbeside this child so miraculously saved.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\nTHALCAVE.\n\n\nAfter the great danger that he had just escaped, Robert incurred\nanother, no less great,--that of being overwhelmed with caresses.\nHowever feeble he was still, not one of these good people could refrain\nfrom pressing him to his heart. But it must be confessed that these\nwell-meant embraces are not fatal, for the boy did not die.\n\nWhen his rescue was certain, thought reverted to his rescuer, and the\nmajor very naturally thought of looking around him. Fifty paces from\nthe stream, a man of lofty stature was standing, motionless, on one\nof the first ledges of the mountain. A long gun lay at his feet. This\nindividual, who had so suddenly appeared, had broad shoulders, and\nlong hair tied with leathern thongs. His height exceeded six feet, and\nhis bronzed face was red between his eyes and mouth, black below his\neyelids, and white on his forehead. After the manner of the Patagonians\nof the frontiers, the native wore a splendid cloak, decorated with\nred arabesques, made of the skin of a guanaco, its silky fur turned\noutward, and sewed with ostrich-tendons. Under his cloak a tippet of\nfox-skin encircled his neck and terminated in a point in front. At his\ngirdle hung a little bag containing the colors with which he painted\nhis face. His leggings were of ox-hide, and fastened to the ankle with\nstraps regularly crossed.\n\nThe figure of this Patagonian was fine, and his face denoted real\nintelligence in spite of the colors that adorned (!) it. He waited in\nan attitude full of dignity, and, seeing him so motionless and stern on\nhis pedestal of rocks, you would have taken him for a statue.\n\nThe major, as soon as he perceived him, pointed him out to Glenarvan,\nwho hastened towards him.

A few moments after\nthey were led back to the temple that served as their prison; but\nRobert Grant and Paganel were no longer with them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER L.\n\nTHE CHIEF'S FUNERAL.\n\n\nKai-Koumou, according to a custom quite ordinary in New Zealand, joined\nthe rank of priest to that of chief, and could, therefore, extend to\npersons or objects the superstitious protection of the taboo.\n\nThe taboo, which is common to the tribes of Polynesia, has the power\nto prohibit at once all connection with the object or person tabooed.\nAccording to the Maori religion, whoever should lay his sacrilegious\nhand on what is declared taboo would be punished with death by the\noffended god; and in case the divinity should delay to avenge his own\ninsult, the priests would not fail to excite his anger.\n\nAs for the prisoners confined in the temple, the taboo had rescued\nthem from the fury of the tribe. Some of the natives, the friends and\npartisans of Kai-Koumou, had stopped suddenly at the command of their\nchief, and had protected the captives.\n\n[Sidenote: THE TORTURES OF SUSPENSE.]\n\nGlenarvan, however, was not blind to the fate that was reserved for\nhim. Only his death could atone for the murder of a chief. Among savage\nraces death is always preceded by a protracted torture. He therefore\nexpected to cruelly expiate the righteous indignation that had nerved\nhis arm, but hoped that Kai-Koumou's rage would fall only on himself.\n\nWhat a night he and his companions passed! Who could depict their\nanguish, or measure their sufferings? Neither poor Robert nor brave\nPaganel had reappeared. But how could they doubt their fate? Were they\nnot the first victims of the natives' vengeance? All hope had vanished\neven from the heart of the major, who did not easily despair. John\nMangles felt himself growing mad at sight of the sad dejection of Mary\nGrant, thus separated from her brother. Glenarvan thought of that\nterrible request of Lady Helena, who, rather than yield to torture or\nslavery, preferred to die by his hand. Could he summon this fearful\ncourage? As for an escape, that was plainly impossible. Ten warriors,\narmed to the teeth, guarded the entrance of the temple.\n\nMorning came at last. There had been no communication between the\nnatives and the prisoners. The hut contained a considerable quantity\nof food, which the unfortunates scarcely touched. Hunger gave place to\ngrief. The day passed without bringing a change or a hope. Doubtless\nthe hour for the dead chief's funeral and their torture would be the\nsame.\n\nHowever, although Glenarvan concluded that Kai-Koumou must have\nabandoned all idea of exchange, the major on this point retained a\ngleam of hope.\n\n\"Who knows,\" said he, reminding Glenarvan of the effect produced upon\nthe chief by the death of Kara-Tété,--\"who knows but that Kai-Koumou in\nreality feels obliged to you?\"\n\nBut, in spite of these observations, Glenarvan would no longer hope.\nThe next day also passed away without the preparations for torture\nbeing made. The reason of the delay was this.\n\nThe Maoris believe that the soul, for three days after death, inhabits\nthe body of the deceased, and therefore during this time the corpse\nremains unburied. This custom was rigorously observed, and for two days\nthe pah was deserted. Captain Mangles frequently stood on Wilson's\nshoulders and surveyed the fortification. No native was seen; only the\nsentinels guarded in turn at the door of their prison.\n\nBut on the third day the huts were opened. The savages, men, women,\nand children, to the number of several hundreds, assembled in the pah,\nsilent and calm. Kai-Koumou came out of his house, and, surrounded by\nthe principal warriors of his tribe, took his place on a mound several\nfeet high in the centre of the fortification.

I have promised to remain forever\nwith you, and now I could not break my promise if I would. The treasure\nwill be no more mine than yours, and neither of us will quit this\nprison. But my real treasure is not that, my dear friend, which awaits\nme beneath the sombre rocks of Monte Cristo, it is your presence, our\nliving together five or six hours a day, in spite of our jailers; it is\nthe rays of intelligence you have elicited from my brain, the languages\nyou have implanted in my memory, and which have taken root there with\nall their philological ramifications. These different sciences that you\nhave made so easy to me by the depth of the knowledge you possess of\nthem, and the clearness of the principles to which you have reduced\nthem—this is my treasure, my beloved friend, and with this you have\nmade me rich and happy.

To have you as long as possible near me, to hear\nyour eloquent speech,—which embellishes my mind, strengthens my soul,\nand makes my whole frame capable of great and terrible things, if I\nshould ever be free,—so fills my whole existence, that the despair to\nwhich I was just on the point of yielding when I knew you, has no\nlonger any hold over me; and this—this is my fortune—not chimerical,\nbut actual. I owe you my real good, my present happiness; and all the\nsovereigns of the earth, even Cæsar Borgia himself, could not deprive\nme of this.”\n\nThus, if not actually happy, yet the days these two unfortunates passed\ntogether went quickly. Faria, who for so long a time had kept silence\nas to the treasure, now perpetually talked of it. As he had prophesied\nwould be the case, he remained paralyzed in the right arm and the left\nleg, and had given up all hope of ever enjoying it himself. But he was\ncontinually thinking over some means of escape for his young companion,\nand anticipating the pleasure he would enjoy. For fear the letter might\nbe some day lost or stolen, he compelled Dantès to learn it by heart;\nand Dantès knew it from the first to the last word. Then he destroyed\nthe second portion, assured that if the first were seized, no one would\nbe able to discover its real meaning. Whole hours sometimes passed\nwhile Faria was giving instructions to Dantès,—instructions which were\nto serve him when he was at liberty. Then, once free, from the day and\nhour and moment when he was so, he could have but one only thought,\nwhich was, to gain Monte Cristo by some means, and remain there alone\nunder some pretext which would arouse no suspicions; and once there, to\nendeavor to find the wonderful caverns, and search in the appointed\nspot,—the appointed spot, be it remembered, being the farthest angle in\nthe second opening.\n\nIn the meanwhile the hours passed, if not rapidly, at least tolerably.\nFaria, as we have said, without having recovered the use of his hand\nand foot, had regained all the clearness of his understanding, and had\ngradually, besides the moral instructions we have detailed, taught his\nyouthful companion the patient and sublime duty of a prisoner, who\nlearns to make something from nothing.

Paganel,\nexcited and scarcely finding his words, resumed these interesting\ninterrogatories, while his eyes, fixed upon the grave Indian, strove\nto anticipate his reply before it issued from his lips. Every word the\nPatagonian said he repeated in English, so that his companions heard\nthe Indian speak, as it were, in their own language.\n\n\"And this prisoner?\" inquired Paganel.\n\n\"He was a stranger,\" replied Thalcave slowly; \"a European.\"\n\n\"You have seen him?\"\n\n\"No, but he is mentioned in the accounts of the Indians. He was a brave\nman.\"\n\n\"You understand, my friends,\" said Paganel; \"a courageous man!\"\n\n\"My father!\" cried Robert Grant.\n\nThen, addressing Paganel:\n\n\"How do you say 'It is my father,' in Spanish?\" he asked.\n\n\"_Es mio padre_,\" answered the geographer.\n\nImmediately Robert, taking Thalcave's hands, said in a sweet voice,--\n\n\"_Es mio padre!_\"\n\n\"_Suo padre!_\" replied the Patagonian, whose look brightened.\n\nHe took the boy in his arms, lifted him from his horse, and gazed at\nhim with the most curious sympathy. His intelligent countenance became\nsuffused with a peaceful emotion.\n\nBut Paganel had not finished his inquiries. Where was this prisoner?\nWhat was he doing? When had Thalcave heard of him? All these questions\nthronged his mind at once. He did not have to wait long for answers,\nbut learnt that the European was a slave of one of the Indian tribes\nthat scour the plains.\n\n\"But where was he last?\" asked Paganel.\n\n\"With the cazique Calfoucoura,\" answered Thalcave.\n\n\"On the line we have been following?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And who is this cazique?\"\n\n\"The chief of the Poyuches Indians; a man with two tongues and two\nhearts.\"\n\n[Sidenote: A SCIENTIFIC BATH.]\n\n\"That is to say, false in word and in deed,\" said Paganel, after\ntranslating to his companions this beautiful metaphor of the Indian\nlanguage. \"And can we rescue our friend?\" he added.\n\n\"Perhaps so, if your friend is still in the hands of the Indians.\"\n\n\"And when did you hear of him?\"\n\n\"A long time ago, and, since then, the sun has brought back two summers\nto the sky.\"\n\nGlenarvan's joy could not be described.

It was possible that the three\nprisoners had been separated a long time. But the substance of the\nPatagonian's information was that the Indians spoke of a European who\nhad fallen into their power. The date of his captivity, the place where\nhe must have been, everything, even to the Patagonian phrase used to\nexpress his courage, related evidently to Captain Harry Grant.\n\nTheir progress was now somewhat slow and difficult; their next object\nbeing to reach and cross the river Colorado, to w", "label": "CONTRADICT"}
