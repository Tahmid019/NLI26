Three persons only could understand this\nlanguage of the poor paralytic; these were Villefort, Valentine, and\nthe old servant of whom we have already spoken. But as Villefort saw\nhis father but seldom, and then only when absolutely obliged, and as he\nnever took any pains to please or gratify him when he was there, all\nthe old man’s happiness was centred in his granddaughter. Valentine, by\nmeans of her love, her patience, and her devotion, had learned to read\nin Noirtier’s look all the varied feelings which were passing in his\nmind. To this dumb language, which was so unintelligible to others, she\nanswered by throwing her whole soul into the expression of her\ncountenance, and in this manner were the conversations sustained\nbetween the blooming girl and the helpless invalid, whose body could\nscarcely be called a living one, but who, nevertheless, possessed a\nfund of knowledge and penetration, united with a will as powerful as\never although clogged by a body rendered utterly incapable of obeying\nits impulses.\n\nValentine had solved the problem, and was able easily to understand his\nthoughts, and to convey her own in return, and, through her untiring\nand devoted assiduity, it was seldom that, in the ordinary transactions\nof every-day life, she failed to anticipate the wishes of the living,\nthinking mind, or the wants of the almost inanimate body.\n\nAs to the servant, he had, as we have said, been with his master for\nfive-and-twenty years, therefore he knew all his habits, and it was\nseldom that Noirtier found it necessary to ask for anything, so prompt\nwas he in administering to all the necessities of the invalid.\n\nVillefort did not need the help of either Valentine or the domestic in\norder to carry on with his father the strange conversation which he was\nabout to begin. As we have said, he perfectly understood the old man’s\nvocabulary, and if he did not use it more often, it was only\nindifference and _ennui_ which prevented him from so doing. He\ntherefore allowed Valentine to go into the garden, sent away Barrois,\nand after having seated himself at his father’s right hand, while\nMadame de Villefort placed herself on the left, he addressed him thus:\n\n“I trust you will not be displeased, sir, that Valentine has not come\nwith us, or that I dismissed Barrois, for our conference will be one\nwhich could not with propriety be carried on in the presence of either.\nMadame de Villefort and I have a communication to make to you.”\n\nNoirtier’s face remained perfectly passive during this long preamble,\nwhile, on the contrary, Villefort’s eye was endeavoring to penetrate\ninto the inmost recesses of the old man’s heart.\n\n“This communication,” continued the procureur, in that cold and\ndecisive tone which seemed at once to preclude all discussion, “will,\nwe are sure, meet with your approbation.”\n\nThe eye of the invalid still retained that vacancy of expression which\nprevented his son from obtaining any knowledge of the feelings which\nwere passing in his mind; he listened, nothing more.\n\n“Sir,” resumed Villefort, “we are thinking of marrying Valentine.” Had\nthe old man’s face been moulded in wax it could not have shown less\nemotion at this news than was now to be traced there. “The marriage\nwill take place in less than three months,” said Villefort.\n\nNoirtier’s eye still retained its inanimate expression.\n\nMadame de Villefort now took her part in the conversation and added:\n\n“We thought this news would possess an interest for you, sir, who have\nalways entertained a great affection for Valentine; it therefore only\nnow remains for us to tell you the name of the young man for whom she\nis destined.

He took nothing away, for he was willing that the guilty convict\nshould inherit his possessions.\n\nThey returned to the vessel; and, as he expected to sail the same day,\nGlenarvan gave orders for the quartermaster's landing. Ayrton was\nbrought on deck, and found himself in the presence of Harry Grant.\n\n\"It is I, Ayrton,\" said he.\n\n\"Yes, captain,\" replied Ayrton, without betraying any astonishment at\nHarry Grant's appearance. \"Well, I am not sorry to see you again in\ngood health.\"\n\n[Illustration: The passengers could see the quartermaster, with folded\narms, standing motionless as a statue, on a rock, and gazing at the\nvessel.]\n\n\"It seems, Ayrton, that I made a mistake in landing you on an inhabited\ncoast.\"\n\n\"It seems so, captain.\"\n\n\"You will take my place on this desert island. May Heaven lead you to\nrepentance!\"\n\n\"May it be so,\" rejoined Ayrton, in a calm tone.\n\nThen Glenarvan, addressing the quartermaster, said:\n\n\"Do you still adhere, Ayrton, to this determination to be abandoned?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord.\"\n\n\"Does Tabor Island suit you?\"\n\n\"Perfectly.\"\n\n\"Now listen to my last words.

What,\nmoreover, could ten defenceless men do against thirty well-armed\nsavages? Besides, Glenarvan thought it likely that Kai-Koumou's tribe\nhad lost some chief of high rank whom they were particularly anxious to\nrecover; and he was not mistaken.\n\nThe next day the canoe ascended the river with increased swiftness.\nIt stopped for a moment at the junction of a small river which wound\nacross the plains on the right bank. Here another canoe, with ten\nnatives on board, joined Kai-Koumou. The warriors merely exchanged\nsalutations, and then continued their course. The new-comers had\nrecently fought against the English troops, as could be seen by their\ntattered garments, their gory weapons, and the wounds that still bled\nbeneath their rags. They were gloomy and taciturn, and, with the\nindifference common to all savage races, paid no attention to the\ncaptives.\n\nTowards evening Kai-Koumou landed at the foot of the mountains,\nwhose nearer ridges reached precipitously to the river-bank. Here\ntwenty natives, who had disembarked from their canoes, were making\npreparations for the night. Fires blazed beneath the trees. A chief,\nequal in rank to Kai-Koumou, advanced with measured pace, and, rubbing\nhis nose against that of the latter, saluted him cordially. The\nprisoners were stationed in the centre of the encampment, and guarded\nwith extreme vigilance.\n\nThe next morning the ascent of the Waikato was resumed. Other boats\ncame from various affluents of the river. Sixty warriors, evidently\nfugitives from the last insurrection, had now assembled, and were\nreturning, more or less wounded in the fray, to the mountain districts.\nSometimes a song arose from the canoes, as they advanced in single\nfile. One native struck up the patriotic ode of the mysterious \"Pihé,\"\nthe national hymn that calls the Maoris to battle. The full and\nsonorous voice of the singer waked the echoes of the mountains; and\nafter each stanza his comrades struck their breasts, and sang the\nwarlike verses in chorus. Then they seized their oars again, and the\ncanoes were headed up stream.\n\nDuring the day a singular sight enlivened the voyage. About four\no'clock the canoe, without lessening its speed, guided by the steady\nhand of the chief, dashed through a narrow gorge. Eddies broke\nviolently against numerous small islands, which rendered navigation\nexceeding dangerous. Never could it be more hazardous to capsize, for\nthe banks afforded no refuge, and whoever had set foot on the porous\ncrust of the shore would probably have perished. At this point the\nriver flowed between warm springs, oxide of iron colored the muddy\nground a brilliant red, and not a yard of firm earth could be seen.\nThe air was heavy with a penetrating sulphureous odor. The natives did\nnot regard it, but the captives were seriously annoyed by the noxious\nvapors exhaled from the fissures of the soil and the bubbles that\nburst and discharged their gaseous contents. Yet, however disagreeable\nthese emanations were, the eye could not but admire this magnificent\nspectacle.\n\n[Illustration: At this point the river flowed between warm springs, and\nnot a yard of firm earth could be seen.]\n\nThe canoes soon after entered a dense cloud of white smoke, whose\nwreaths rose in gradually decreasing circles above the river. On the\nshores a hundred geysers, some shooting forth masses of vapor, and\nothers overflowing in liquid columns, varied their effects, like the\njets and cascades of a fountain. It seemed as though some engineer was\ndirecting at his pleasure the outflowings of these springs, as the\nwaters and vapor, mingling in the air, formed rainbows in the sunbeams.\n\nFor two miles the canoes glided within this vapory atmosphere,\nenveloped in its warm waves that rolled along the surface of the water.\nThen the sulphureous smoke disappeared, and a pure swift current of\nfresh air refreshed the panting voyagers.

Moreover,\nthe unfortunate woman would not have been allowed to survive him;\nit was the custom, in accordance with duty, and examples of such\nsacrifices are not wanting in New Zealand history. The woman appeared.\nShe was still young.

They were servants, whom the pitiless laws of war had reduced\nto slavery. During the life of the chief they had undergone the\nseverest privations, suffered a thousand abuses, had been scantily fed,\nand compelled constantly to labor like beasts; and now, according to\nthe Maori belief, they were to continue their existence of servitude\nfor eternity.\n\nThey appeared to be resigned to their fate, and were not astonished\nat a sacrifice they had long anticipated. Their freedom from all\nbonds showed that they would meet death unresistingly. Moreover, this\ndeath was rapid, protracted sufferings were spared them. These were\nreserved for the captives who stood trembling not twenty paces distant.\nSix blows of the méré, given by six stalwart warriors, stretched the\nvictims on the ground in a pool of blood. It was the signal for a\nterrible scene of cannibalism, which followed in all its horrible\ndetails.\n\nGlenarvan and his companions, breathless with fright, strove to hide\nthis awful scene from the eyes of the two unhappy ladies. They now\nunderstood what awaited them at sunrise the next day, and what cruel\ntortures would doubtless precede such a death. They were dumb with\nhorror.\n\nThe funeral dance now began.

He saw him on the deck of the Britannia; he followed him to the\nbosom of the waves; he clung with him to the rocks of the shore; he\ndragged himself panting along the beach, out of reach of the waves.\n\nOften during the course of this narration words escaped his lips.\n\n\"Oh, papa! my poor papa!\" he cried, pressing close to his sister.\n\nAs for Miss Grant, she listened with clasped hands, and did not utter a\nword until the story was ended, when she said,--\n\n\"Oh, madam, the document! the document!\"\n\n\"I no longer have it, my dear child,\" replied Lady Helena.\n\n\"You no longer have it?\"\n\n\"No; for the very sake of your father, Lord Glenarvan had to take it\nto London; but I have told you all it contained, word for word, and\nhow we succeeded in discovering the exact meaning.

Here\ntwenty natives, who had disembarked from their canoes, were making\npreparations for the night. Fires blazed beneath the trees. A chief,\nequal in rank to Kai-Koumou, advanced with measured pace, and, rubbing\nhis nose against that of the latter, saluted him cordially. The\nprisoners were stationed in the centre of the encampment, and guarded\nwith extreme vigilance.\n\nThe next morning the ascent of the Waikato was resumed. Other boats\ncame from various affluents of the river. Sixty warriors, evidently\nfugitives from the last insurrection, had now assembled, and were\nreturning, more or less wounded in the fray, to the mountain districts.\nSometimes a song arose from the canoes, as they advanced in single\nfile. One native struck up the patriotic ode of the mysterious \"Pihé,\"\nthe national hymn that calls the Maoris to battle. The full and\nsonorous voice of the singer waked the echoes of the mountains; and\nafter each stanza his comrades struck their breasts, and sang the\nwarlike verses in chorus. Then they seized their oars again, and the\ncanoes were headed up stream.\n\nDuring the day a singular sight enlivened the voyage. About four\no'clock the canoe, without lessening its speed, guided by the steady\nhand of the chief, dashed through a narrow gorge. Eddies broke\nviolently against numerous small islands, which rendered navigation\nexceeding dangerous. Never could it be more hazardous to capsize, for\nthe banks afforded no refuge, and whoever had set foot on the porous\ncrust of the shore would probably have perished. At this point the\nriver flowed between warm springs, oxide of iron colored the muddy\nground a brilliant red, and not a yard of firm earth could be seen.\nThe air was heavy with a penetrating sulphureous odor. The natives did\nnot regard it, but the captives were seriously annoyed by the noxious\nvapors exhaled from the fissures of the soil and the bubbles that\nburst and discharged their gaseous contents. Yet, however disagreeable\nthese emanations were, the eye could not but admire this magnificent\nspectacle.\n\n[Illustration: At this point the river flowed between warm springs, and\nnot a yard of firm earth could be seen.]\n\nThe canoes soon after entered a dense cloud of white smoke, whose\nwreaths rose in gradually decreasing circles above the river. On the\nshores a hundred geysers, some shooting forth masses of vapor, and\nothers overflowing in liquid columns, varied their effects, like the\njets and cascades of a fountain. It seemed as though some engineer was\ndirecting at his pleasure the outflowings of these springs, as the\nwaters and vapor, mingling in the air, formed rainbows in the sunbeams.\n\nFor two miles the canoes glided within this vapory atmosphere,\nenveloped in its warm waves that rolled along the surface of the water.\nThen the sulphureous smoke disappeared, and a pure swift current of\nfresh air refreshed the panting voyagers. The region of the springs was\npassed. Before the cl", "label": "NEUTRAL"}

Noirtier—for it was, indeed, he who entered—looked after the servant\nuntil the door was closed, and then, fearing, no doubt, that he might\nbe overheard in the antechamber, he opened the door again, nor was the\nprecaution useless, as appeared from the rapid retreat of Germain, who\nproved that he was not exempt from the sin which ruined our first\nparents. M. Noirtier then took the trouble to close and bolt the\nantechamber door, then that of the bedchamber, and then extended his\nhand to Villefort, who had followed all his motions with surprise which\nhe could not conceal.\n\n“Well, now, my dear Gérard,” said he to the young man, with a very\nsignificant look, “do you know, you seem as if you were not very glad\nto see me?”\n\n“My dear father,” said Villefort, “I am, on the contrary, delighted;\nbut I so little expected your visit, that it has somewhat overcome me.”\n\n“But, my dear fellow,” replied M.

But go on, what about the club in the Rue Saint-Jacques?”\n\n“Why, they induced General Quesnel to go there, and General Quesnel,\nwho quitted his own house at nine o’clock in the evening, was found the\nnext day in the Seine.”\n\n0151m\n\n\n\n“And who told you this fine story?”\n\n“The king himself.”\n\n“Well, then, in return for your story,” continued Noirtier, “I will\ntell you another.”\n\n“My dear father, I think I already know what you are about to tell me.”\n\n“Ah, you have heard of the landing of the emperor?”\n\n“Not so loud, father, I entreat of you—for your own sake as well as\nmine. Yes, I heard this news, and knew it even before you could; for\nthree days ago I posted from Marseilles to Paris with all possible\nspeed, half-desperate at the enforced delay.”\n\n“Three days ago? You are crazy. Why, three days ago the emperor had not\nlanded.”\n\n“No matter, I was aware of his intention.”\n\n“How did you know about it?”\n\n“By a letter addressed to you from the Island of Elba.”\n\n“To me?”\n\n“To you; and which I discovered in the pocket-book of the messenger.\nHad that letter fallen into the hands of another, you, my dear father,\nwould probably ere this have been shot.” Villefort’s father laughed.\n\n“Come, come,” said he, “will the Restoration adopt imperial methods so\npromptly?

The line of the thirty-seventh parallel, on which they\nwere traveling, led them through the diggings and municipality of Mount\nAlexander, which was one of the most successful spots for the digger at\nthe commencement of the gold fever, in consequence of the comparatively\nlevel nature of the ground and the general richness of the soil, so\ndifferent from some other localities where only once in a while was\nsome enormous nugget to be found.

He was surprised by the nearness of the land, which was\nonly eight miles off, when he thought it thirty or forty.

It was uncertain,\nbut as their only chance they must venture it.\n\n\"Hard alee!\" cried Captain Mangles to Wilson.\n\nThe Macquarie began to approach the new line of reefs.

The vessel had struck upon a rock. The\nbob-stays broke, and nearly overthrew the mainmast. Could they come\nabout without any other injury? No; for all at once there was a calm,\nand the ship veered to windward again, and her movements suddenly\nceased. A lofty wave seized and bore her forward towards the reefs,\nwhile she rolled heavily. The mainmast went by the board with all its\nrigging, the brig heaved twice and was motionless, leaning over to\nstarboard. The pump-lights were shattered in pieces, and the passengers\nrushed to the deck; but the waves were sweeping it from one end to\nthe other, and they could not remain without danger. Captain Mangles,\nknowing that the ship was firmly imbedded in the sand, besought them\nfor their own sakes to go below again.\n\n\"The truth, John?\" asked Glenarvan, faintly.\n\n\"The truth, my lord, is that we shall not founder.

Paganel,\nexcited and scarcely finding his words, resumed these interesting\ninterrogatories, while his eyes, fixed upon the grave Indian, strove\nto anticipate his reply before it issued from his lips. Every word the\nPatagonian said he repeated in English, so that his companions heard\nthe Indian speak, as it were, in their own language.\n\n\"And this prisoner?\" inquired Paganel.\n\n\"He was a stranger,\" replied Thalcave slowly; \"a European.\"\n\n\"You have seen him?\"\n\n\"No, but he is mentioned in the accounts of the Indians. He was a brave\nman.\"\n\n\"You understand, my friends,\" said Paganel; \"a courageous man!\"\n\n\"My father!\" cried Robert Grant.\n\nThen, addressing Paganel:\n\n\"How do you say 'It is my father,' in Spanish?\" he asked.\n\n\"_Es mio padre_,\" answered the geographer.\n\nImmediately Robert, taking Thalcave's hands, said in a sweet voice,--\n\n\"_Es mio padre!_\"\n\n\"_Suo padre!_\" replied the Patagonian, whose look brightened.\n\nHe took the boy in his arms, lifted him from his horse, and gazed at\nhim with the most curious sympathy. His intelligent countenance became\nsuffused with a peaceful emotion.\n\nBut Paganel had not finished his inquiries. Where was this prisoner?\nWhat was he doing? When had Thalcave heard of him? All these questions\nthronged his mind at once. He did not have to wait long for answers,\nbut learnt that the European was a slave of one of the Indian tribes\nthat scour the plains.\n\n\"But where was he last?\" asked Paganel.\n\n\"With the cazique Calfoucoura,\" answered Thalcave.\n\n\"On the line we have been following?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And who is this cazique?\"\n\n\"The chief of the Poyuches Indians; a man with two tongues and two\nhearts.\"\n\n[Sidenote: A SCIENTIFIC BATH.]\n\n\"That is to say, false in word and in deed,\" said Paganel, after\ntranslating to his companions this beautiful metaphor of the Indian\nlanguage. \"And can we rescue our friend?\" he added.\n\n\"Perhaps so, if your friend is still in the hands of the Indians.\"\n\n\"And when did you hear of him?\"\n\n\"A long time ago, and, since then, the sun has brought back two summers\nto the sky.\"\n\nGlenarvan's joy could not be described. This answer coincided exactly\nwith the date of the document.

It was possible that the three\nprisoners had been separated a long time. But the substance of the\nPatagonian's information was that the Indians spoke of a European who\nhad fallen into their power. The date of his captivity, the place where\nhe must have been, everything, even to the Patagonian phrase used to\nexpress his courage, related evidently to Captain Harry Grant.\n\nTheir progress was now somewhat slow and difficult; their next object\nbeing to reach and cross the river Colorado, to w", "label": "SUPPORT"}

Hollow rumblings and hissings sounded under the thin\ncrust. But the bold experimenters, like real Vulcans, governing the\nunderground fires, worked on in silence. Several cracks and a few gusts\nof hot smoke warned them that their position was becoming dangerous.\nBut a final effort detached the block, which glided down the slope of\nthe mountain and disappeared.\n\nThe thin covering at once yielded. An incandescent column poured forth\ntowards the sky with loud explosions, while streams of boiling water\nand lava rolled towards the encampment of the natives and the valleys\nbelow. The whole peak trembled, and you might almost have thought that\nit was disappearing in a general conflagration.\n\nGlenarvan and his companions had scarcely time to escape the shock of\nthe eruption. They fled to the inclosure of the tomb, but not without\nreceiving a few scalding drops of the water, which bubbled and exhaled\na strong sulphureous odor.\n\nThen mud, lava, and volcanic fragments mingled in the scene of\ndevastation. Torrents of flame furrowed the sides of the Maunganamu.\nThe adjoining mountains glowed in the light of the eruption, and the\ndeep valleys were illumined with a vivid brightness.\n\nThe savages were soon aroused, both by the noise and the heat\nof the lava that flowed in a scalding tide through the midst of\ntheir encampment. Those whom the fiery flood had not reached fled,\nand ascended the surrounding hills, turning and gazing back at\nthis terrific phenomenon, with which their god, in his wrath, had\noverwhelmed the desecrators of the sacred mountain; while at certain\nmoments they were heard howling their consecratory cry:\n\n\"Taboo! taboo! taboo!\"\n\n[Illustration: The fugitives made themselves levers out of the stakes\nof the tomb.]\n\n[Illustration: An incandescent column poured forth towards the sky with\nloud explosions, while streams of boiling water and lava rolled towards\nthe encampment of the natives.]\n\nMeantime an enormous quantity of vapor, melted stones, and lava had\nescaped from the crater. It was no longer a simple geyser. All this\nvolcanic effervescence had hitherto been confined beneath the crust of\nthe peak, since the outlets of Tangariro sufficed for its expansion;\nbut as a new opening had been made, it had rushed forth with extreme\nviolence.\n\nAll night long, during the storm that raged above and below, the peak\nwas shaken with a commotion that could not but alarm Glenarvan. The\nprisoners, concealed behind the palisade of the tomb, watched the\nfearful progress of the outbreak.\n\nMorning came. The fury of the volcano had not moderated. Thick,\nyellowish vapors mingled with the flames, and torrents of lava poured\nin every direction. Glenarvan, with eye alert and beating heart,\nglanced between the interstices of the inclosure, and surveyed the camp\nof the Maoris.\n\nThe natives had fled to the neighboring plateaus, beyond the reach of\nthe volcano. Several corpses, lying at the foot of the peak, had been\ncharred by the fire. Farther on, towards the pah, the lava had consumed\na number of huts, that were still smoking. The savages, in scattered\ngroups, were gazing at the vapory summit of Maunganamu with religious\nawe.\n\nKai-Koumou came into the midst of his warriors, and Glenarvan\nrecognized him. The chief advanced to the base of the peak, on the side\nspared by the eruption, but did not cross the first slopes. Here, with\noutstretched arms, like a sorcerer exorcising, he made a few grimaces,\nthe meaning of which did not escape the prisoners. As Paganel had\nforeseen, Kai-Koumou was invoking upon the mountain a more rigorous\ntaboo.\n\nSoon after, the natives descended, in single file, the winding paths\nthat led towards the pah.\n\n[Sidenote: A WEARY WAITING.]\n\n\"They are going!\" cried Glenarvan. \"They are abandoning their post!\nGod be thanked!

Go\nto some distant land, found there a useful establishment, and acquire\nin labor the knowledge of life. If you succeed, so much the better; if\nyou fail, it matters little. We shall not regret the money that will\nhave enabled you to become men.\" They obeyed; they chose the province\nof Victoria as the place to sow the paternal bank-notes, and had no\nreason to repent. At the end of three years their establishment had\nattained its present prosperity.\n\nThey had just finished the brief account of their career, when the\ndwelling came in sight at the end of a fine avenue of trees. It was a\ncharming house of wood and brick, surrounded by clusters of plants, and\nhad the elegant form of a Swiss cottage, while a veranda, from which\nhung Chinese lanterns, encircled it like a Roman impluvium. The windows\nwere shaded by brilliant-colored awnings, which at a distance looked\nalmost like masses of flowers. Nothing could be prettier, cozier, or\npleasanter to the sight. On the lawn and among the shrubbery round\nabout stood bronze candelabra, supporting elegant lamps with glass\nglobes, which at nightfall illumined the whole garden with a beauteous\nlight.\n\nNo farm-hands, stables, or outhouses were to be seen,--nothing that\nindicated scenes of toil. The dwellings of the workmen--a regular\nvillage, consisting of some twenty cottages--were a quarter of a mile\ndistant, in the heart of a little valley. Telegraph-wires secured\nimmediate communication between the village and the house of the\nproprietors, which, far from all tumult, was in truth \"a thing of\nbeauty.\"\n\nThe avenue was soon passed. A little iron bridge, of great elegance,\ncrossing a murmuring stream, gave access to the private grounds. A\ncourteous attendant advanced to meet the travelers; the doors of\nthe house were opened, and the guests of Hottam Station entered the\nsumptuous dwelling.\n\nAll the luxuries of refined and civilized life seemed to be present.\nInto the vestibule, which was adorned with decorative subjects,\nillustrating the turf or the chase, opened a spacious parlor, lighted\nwith five windows. A piano, covered with classic and modern music;\neasels, upon which were half-finished paintings; marble statues,\nmounted on tasteful pedestals; on the walls, a few pictures by Flemish\nmasters; rich carpets, soft to the feet as grassy meadows; panels of\ntapestry, descriptive of pleasing mythological episodes; an antique\nchandelier, costly chinaware, delicate vases, and a great variety\nof articles of _virtù_, indicated a high appreciation of beauty and\ncomfort. Everything that could please, everything that could relieve\nthe tedium of a voluntary exile, everything that could remind one of a\nluxurious European home, was to be found in this fairy abode. It would\nhave been easy to imagine oneself in some princely castle of England,\nFrance, or Germany.\n\nThe five windows admitted, through delicate curtains, a light tempered\nand softened by the shadows of the veranda. Lady Helena looked out,\nand was astonished. The house, upon this side, commanded the view of a\nbroad valley, which extended to the eastern mountains. The alternation\nof meadow and woodland, broken here and there by vast clearings, the\ngraceful sweep of the hill-sides, and the outlines of the entire\nlandscape, formed a picture beyond the power of description.

But\nare there not a thousand tortures by which a man may be made to suffer\nwithout society taking the least cognizance of them, or offering him\neven the insufficient means of vengeance, of which we have just spoken?\nAre there not crimes for which the impalement of the Turks, the augers\nof the Persians, the stake and the brand of the Iroquois Indians, are\ninadequate tortures, and which are unpunished by society? Answer me, do\nnot these crimes exist?”\n\n“Yes,” answered Franz; “and it is to punish them that duelling is\ntolerated.”\n\n“Ah, duelling,” cried the count; “a pleasant manner, upon my soul, of\narriving at your end when that end is vengeance! A man has carried off\nyour mistress, a man has seduced your wife, a man has dishonored your\ndaughter; he has rendered the whole life of one who had the right to\nexpect from Heaven that portion of happiness God has promised to\neveryone of his creatures, an existence of misery and infamy; and you\nthink you are avenged because you send a ball through the head, or pass\na sword through the breast, of that man who has planted madness in your\nbrain, and despair in your heart.

No, no,” continued the count, “had I to\navenge myself, it is not thus I would take revenge.”\n\n“Then you disapprove of duelling? You would not fight a duel?” asked\nAlbert in his turn, astonished at this strange theory.\n\n“Oh, yes,” replied the count; “understand me, I would fight a duel for\na trifle, for an insult, for a blow; and the more so that, thanks to my\nskill in all bodily exercises, and the indifference to danger I have\ngradually acquired, I should be almost certain to kill my man.

What,\nmoreover, could ten defenceless men do against thirty well-armed\nsavages? Besides, Glenarvan thought it likely that Kai-Koumou's tribe\nhad lost some chief of high rank whom they were particularly anxious to\nrecover; and he was not mistaken.\n\nThe next day the canoe ascended the river with increased swiftness.\nIt stopped for a moment at the junction of a small river which wound\nacross the plains on the right bank. Here another canoe, with ten\nnatives on board, joined Kai-Koumou. The warriors merely exchanged\nsalutations, and then continued their course. The new-comers had\nrecently fought against the English troops, as could be seen by their\ntattered garments, their gory weapons, and the wounds that still bled\nbeneath their rags. They were gloomy and taciturn, and, with the\nindifference common to all savage races, paid no attention to the\ncaptives.\n\nTowards evening Kai-Koumou landed at the foot of the mountains,\nwhose nearer ridges reached precipitously to the river-bank. Here\ntwenty natives, who had disembarked from their canoes, were making\npreparations for the night. Fires blazed beneath the trees. A chief,\nequal in rank to Kai-Koumou, advanced with measured pace, and, rubbing\nhis nose against that of the latter, saluted him cordially. The\nprisoners were stationed in the centre of the encampment, and guarded\nwith extreme vigilance.\n\nThe next morning the ascent of the Waikato was resumed. Other boats\ncame from various affluents of the river. Sixty warriors, evidently\nfugitives from the last insurrection, had now assembled, and were\nreturning, more or less wounded in the fray, to the mountain districts.\nSometimes a song arose from the canoes, as they advanced in single\nfile. One native struck up the patriotic ode of the mysterious \"Pihé,\"\nthe national hymn that calls the Maoris to battle. The full and\nsonorous voice of the singer waked the echoes of the mountains; and\nafter each stanza his comrades struck their breasts, and sang the\nwarlike verses in chorus. Then they seized their oars again, and the\ncanoes were headed up stream.\n\nDuring the day a singular sight enlivened the voyage. About four\no'clock the canoe, without lessening its speed, guided by the steady\nhand of the chief, dashed through a narrow gorge. Eddies broke\nviolently against numerous small islands, which rendered navigation\nexceeding dangerous. Never could it be more hazardous to capsize, for\nthe banks afforded no refuge, and whoever had set foot on the porous\ncrust of the shore would probably have perished. At this point the\nriver flowed between warm springs, oxide of iron colored the muddy\nground a brilliant red, and not a yard of firm earth could be seen.\nThe air was heavy with a penetrating sulphureous odor. The natives did\nnot regard it, but the captives were seriously annoyed by the noxious\nvapors exhaled from the fissures of the soil and the bubbles that\nburst and discharged their gaseous contents. Yet, however disagreeable\nthese emanations were, the eye could not but admire this magnificent\nspectacle.\n\n[Illustration: At this point the river flowed between warm springs, and\nnot a yard of firm earth could be seen.]\n\nThe canoes soon after entered a dense cloud of white smoke, whose\nwreaths rose in gradually decreasing circles above the river. On the\nshores a hundred geysers, some shooting forth masses of vapor, and\nothers overflowing in liquid columns, varied their effects, like the\njets and cascades of a fountain. It seemed as though some engineer was\ndirecting at his pleasure the outflowings of these springs, as the\nwaters and vapor, mingling in the air, formed rainbows in the sunbeams.\n\nFor two miles the canoes glided within this vapory atmosphere,\nenveloped in its warm waves that rolled along the surface of the water.\nThen the sulphureous smoke disappeared, and a pure swift current of\nfresh air refreshed the panting voyagers.

When he had finished with the orange-tree, he began at\nthe cactus; but this, not being so easily plucked as the orange-tree,\npricked him dreadfully. He shuddered, and rubbed his eyes as though\nawaking from a dream.\n\n“Sir,” said Monte Cristo to him, “I do not recommend my pictures to\nyou, who possess such splendid paintings; but, nevertheless, here are\ntwo by Hobbema, a Paul Potter, a Mieris, two by Gerard Douw, a Raphael,\na Van Dyck, a Zurbaran, and two or three by Murillo, worth looking at.”\n\n“Stay,” said Debray; “I recognize this Hobbema.”\n\n“Ah, indeed!”\n\n“Yes; it was proposed for the Museum.”\n\n“Which, I believe, does not contain one?” said Monte Cristo.\n\n“No; and yet they refused to buy it.”\n\n“Why?” said Château-Renaud.\n\n“You pretend not to know,—because government was not rich enough.”\n\n“Ah, pardon me,” said Château-Renaud; “I have heard of these things\nevery day during the last eight years, and I cannot understand them\nyet.”\n\n“You will, by and by,” said Debray.\n\n“I think not,” replied Château-Renaud.\n\n“Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti and Count Andrea Cavalcanti,” announced\nBaptistin.\n\nA black satin stock, fresh from the maker’s hands, gray moustaches, a\nbold eye, a major’s uniform, ornamented with three medals and five\ncrosses—in fact, the thorough bearing of an old soldier—such was the\nappearance of Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti, that tender father with whom\nwe are already acquainted. Close to him, dressed in entirely new\nclothes, advanced smilingly Count Andrea Cavalcanti, the dutiful son,\nwhom we also know. The three young people were talking together.

The last act of the funeral was played with the usual rites.\n\nThe bodies of Kara-Tété and his wife were taken up, and their limbs\nbent and gathered against the stomach, according to the New Zealand\ncustom. The place for the tomb had been chosen outside of the\nfortification, about two miles distant, on the summit of a small\nmountain, called Maunganamu, situated on the right shore of the lake.\n\nThither the bodies were to be carried. Two very rude palanquins, or\nrather litters, were brought to the foot of the mound. The corpses,\nfolded together, in a sitting posture, and tied in their clothes by a\ngirdle of withes, were placed on this primitive bier. Four warriors\nbore it between them, and the entire tribe, chanting the funeral hymn,\nfollowed them in procession to the place of burial.\n\nThe captives, who were always watched, saw them leave the inner\ninclosure of the pah, and then the songs and cries gradually died away.\nFor about half an hour this funeral escort continued in sight, in the\ndepths of the valley. Finally they perceived it again winding along\nthe mountain paths. The distance gave a fantastic appearance to the\nundulating movements of the long, sinuous column.\n\nThe tribe stopped at the summit of the mountain, which was eight\nhundred feet high, at the place prepared for Kara-Tété's interment.\nA common Maori would have had only a hole and a heap of stones for a\ngrave; but for a powerful and dreaded chief, destined doubtless for a\nspeedy deification, a tomb worthy of his exploits was reserved.\n\n[Sidenote: THE LAST NIGHT.]\n\nThe sepulchre had been surrounded by palisades, while stakes,\nornamented with faces reddened with ochre, stood beside the grave\nwhere the bodies were to lie. The relatives had not forgotten that the\n\"waidoua\" (the spirit of the dead) feeds on substantial nourishment\nlike the body during this perishable life.

Were they\nnot the first victims of the natives' vengeance? All hope had vanished\neven from the heart of the major, who did not easily despair.

Masses of vapor, generated by the high temperature\nof the preceding days, condensed into thick clouds and threatened to\ndissolve in showers of rain. Moreover, the proximity of the Atlantic,\nand the west wind, which here reigns supreme, rendered the climate of\nthis region peculiarly moist. However, for that day at least the heavy\nclouds did not break; and at evening the horses, after traveling forty\nmiles, halted on the edge of a deep \"cañada,\" an immense natural ditch\nfilled with water.

Soon they came to large ponds, some already\ndeep and others just forming. So long as there were only lagoons, the\nhorses could easily extricate themselves; but with these treacherous\nswamps it was more difficult.

The geographer was accordingly requested to interrogate\nthe Indian, which he did at once. Thalcave replied that he was\nastonished to see the plain so soaked with moisture.

We shall not regret the money that will\nhave enabled you to become men.\" They obeyed; they chose the province\nof Victoria as the place to sow the paternal bank-notes, and had no\nreason to repent. At the end of three years their establishment had\nattained its present prosperity.\n\nThey had just finished the brief account of their career, when the\ndwelling came in sight at the end of a fine avenue of trees. It was a\ncharming house of wood and brick, surrounded by clusters of plants, and\nhad the elegant form of a Swiss cottage, while a veranda, from which\nhung Chinese lanterns, encircled it like a Roman impluvium. The windows\nwere shaded by brilliant-colored awnings, which at a distance looked\nalmost like masses of flowers. Nothing could be prettier, cozier, or\npleasanter to the sight. On the lawn and among the shrubbery round\nabout stood bronze candelabra, supporting elegant lamps with glass\nglobes, which at nightfall illumined the whole garden with a beauteous\nlight.\n\nNo farm-hands, stables, or outhouses were to be seen,--nothing that\nindicated scenes of toil. The dwellings of the workmen--a regular\nvillage, consisting of some twenty cottages--were a quarter of a mile\ndistant, in the heart of a little valley. Telegraph-wires secured\nimmediate communication between the village and the house of the\nproprietors, which, far from all tumult, was in truth \"a thing of\nbeauty.\"\n\nThe avenue was soon passed.

A\ncourteous attendant advanced to meet the travelers; the doors of\nthe house were opened, and the guests of Hottam Station entered the\nsumptuous dwelling.\n\nAll the luxuries of refined and civilized life seemed to be present.\nInto the vestibule, which was adorned with decorative subjects,\nillustrating the turf or the chase, opened a spacious parlor, lighted\nwith five windows. A piano, covered with classic and modern music;\neasels, upon which were half-finished paintings; marble statues,\nmounted on tasteful pedestals; on the walls, a few pictures by Flemish\nmasters; rich carpets, soft to the feet as grassy meadows; panels of\ntapestry, descriptive of pleasing mythological episodes; an antique\nchandelier, costly chinaware, delicate vases, and a great variety\nof articles of _virtù_, indicated a high appreciation of beauty and\ncomfort. Everything that could please, everything that could relieve\nthe tedium of a voluntary exile, everything that could remind one of a\nluxurious European home, was to be found in this fairy abode. It would\nhave been easy to imagine oneself in some princely castle of England,\nFrance, or Germany.\n\nThe five windows admitted, through delicate curtains, a light tempered\nand softened by the shadows of the veranda.

Now, let us return to the first.\nYou ask me why I have requested this interview; I will tell you in two\nwords, sir; I will not marry count Andrea Cavalcanti.”\n\nDanglars leaped from his chair and raised his eyes and arms towards\nheaven.\n\n40298m\n\n\n\n“Yes, indeed, sir,” continued Eugénie, still quite calm; “you are\nastonished, I see; for since this little affair began, I have not\nmanifested the slightest opposition, and yet I am always sure, when the\nopportunity arrives, to oppose a determined and absolute will to people\nwho have not consulted me, and things which displease me. However, this\ntime, my tranquillity, or passiveness as philosophers say, proceeded\nfrom another source; it proceeded from a wish, like a submissive and\ndevoted daughter” (a slight smile was observable on the purple lips of\nthe young girl), “to practice obedience.”\n\n“Well?” asked Danglars.\n\n“Well, sir,” replied Eugénie, “I have tried to the very last and now\nthat the moment has come, I feel in spite of all my efforts that it is\nimpossible.”\n\n“But,” said Danglars, whose weak mind was at first quite overwhelmed\nwith the weight of this pitiless logic, marking evident premeditation\nand force of will, “what is your reason for this refusal, Eugénie? what\nreason do you assign?”\n\n“My reason?” replied the young girl. “Well, it is not that the man is\nmore ugly, more foolish, or more disagreeable than any other; no, M.\nAndrea Cavalcanti may appear to those who look at men’s faces and\nfigures as a very good specimen of his kind.

Like a genuine Frenchman, Albert had employed his time in\narranging for the evening’s diversion; he had sent to engage a box at\nthe Teatro Argentina; and Franz, having a number of letters to write,\nrelinquished the carriage to Albert for the whole of the day.\n\nAt five o’clock Albert returned, delighted with his day’s work; he had\nbeen occupied in leaving his letters of introduction, and had received\nin return more invitations to balls and routs than it would be possible\nfor him to accept; besides this, he had seen (as he called it) all the\nremarkable sights at Rome. Yes, in a single day he had accomplished\nwhat his more serious-minded companion would have taken weeks to\neffect. Neither had he neglected to ascertain the name of the piece to\nbe played that night at the Teatro Argentina, and also what performers\nappeared in it. The opera of _Parisina_ was announced for\nrepresentation, and the principal actors were Coselli, Moriani, and La\nSpecchia.\n\nThe young men, therefore, had reason to consider themselves fortunate\nin having the opportunity of hearing one of the best works by the\ncomposer of _Lucia di Lammermoor_, supported by three of the most\nrenowned vocalists of Italy.\n\nAlbert had never been able to endure the Italian theatres, with their\norchestras from which it is impossible to see, and the absence of\nbalconies, or open boxes; all these defects pressed hard on a man who\nhad had his stall at the Bouffes, and had shared a lower box at the\nOpera. Still, in spite of this, Albert displayed his most dazzling and\neffective costumes each time he visited the theatres; but, alas, his\nelegant toilet was wholly thrown away, and one of the most worthy\nrepresentatives of Parisian fashion had to carry with him the\nmortifying reflection that he had nearly overrun Italy without meeting\nwith a single adventure.\n\nSometimes Albert would affect to make a joke of his want of success;\nbut internally he was deeply wounded, and his self-love immensely\npiqued, to think that Albert de Morcerf, the most admired and most\nsought after of any young person of his day, should thus be passed\nover, and merely have his labor for his pains. And the thing was so\nmuch the more annoying, as, according to the characteristic modesty of\na Frenchman, Albert had quitted Paris with the full conviction that he\nhad only to show himself in Italy to carry all before him, and that\nupon his return he should astonish the Parisian world with the recital\nof his numerous love-affairs.\n\nAlas, poor Albert! None of those interesting adventures fell in his\nway; the lovely Genoese, Florentines, and Neapolitans were all\nfaithful, if not to their husbands, at least to their lovers, and\nthought not of changing even for the splendid appearance of Albert de\nMorcerf; and all he gained was the painful conviction that the ladies\nof Italy have this advantage over those of France, that they are\nfaithful even in their infidelity.\n\nYet he could not restrain a hope that in Italy, as elsewhere, there\nmight be an exception to the general rule.\n\nAlbert, besides being an elegant, well-looking young man, was also\npossessed of considerable talent and ability; moreover, he was a\nviscount—a recently created one, certainly, but in the present day it\nis not necessary to go as far back as Noah in tracing a descent, and a\ngenealogical tree is equally estimated, whether dated from 1399 or\nmerely 1815; but to crown all these advantages, Albert de Morcerf\ncommanded an income of 50,000 livres, a more than sufficient sum to\nrender him a personage of considerable importance in Paris. It was\ntherefore no small mortification to him to have visited most of the\nprincipal cities in Italy without having excited the most trifling\nobservation.\n\nAlbert, however, hoped to indemnify himself for all these slights and\nindifferences during the Carnival, knowing full well th", "label": "CONTRADICT"}

He returned to\nFrance with the epaulet of sub-lieutenant, and as the protection of the\ngeneral, who is in the highest favor, was accorded to him, he was a\ncaptain in 1823, during the Spanish war—that is to say, at the time\nwhen Danglars made his early speculations. Fernand was a Spaniard, and\nbeing sent to Spain to ascertain the feeling of his fellow-countrymen,\nfound Danglars there, got on very intimate terms with him, won over the\nsupport of the royalists at the capital and in the provinces, received\npromises and made pledges on his own part, guided his regiment by paths\nknown to himself alone through the mountain gorges which were held by\nthe royalists, and, in fact, rendered such services in this brief\ncampaign that, after the taking of Trocadero, he was made colonel, and\nreceived the title of count and the cross of an officer of the Legion\nof Honor.”\n\n“Destiny! destiny!” murmured the abbé.\n\n“Yes, but listen: this was not all.

A few moments after\nthey were led back to the temple that served as their prison; but\nRobert Grant and Paganel were no longer with them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER L.\n\nTHE CHIEF'S FUNERAL.\n\n\nKai-Koumou, according to a custom quite ordinary in New Zealand, joined\nthe rank of priest to that of chief, and could, therefore, extend to\npersons or objects the superstitious protection of the taboo.\n\nThe taboo, which is common to the tribes of Polynesia, has the power\nto prohibit at once all connection with the object or person tabooed.\nAccording to the Maori religion, whoever should lay his sacrilegious\nhand on what is declared taboo would be punished with death by the\noffended god; and in case the divinity should delay to avenge his own\ninsult, the priests would not fail to excite his anger.\n\nAs for the prisoners confined in the temple, the taboo had rescued\nthem from the fury of the tribe. Some of the natives, the friends and\npartisans of Kai-Koumou, had stopped suddenly at the command of their\nchief, and had protected the captives.\n\n[Sidenote: THE TORTURES OF SUSPENSE.]\n\nGlenarvan, however, was not blind to the fate that was reserved for\nhim. Only his death could atone for the murder of a chief. Among savage\nraces death is always preceded by a protracted torture. He therefore\nexpected to cruelly expiate the righteous indignation that had nerved\nhis arm, but hoped that Kai-Koumou's rage would fall only on himself.\n\nWhat a night he and his companions passed! Who could depict their\nanguish, or measure their sufferings? Neither poor Robert nor brave\nPaganel had reappeared. But how could they doubt their fate? Were they\nnot the first victims of the natives' vengeance? All hope had vanished\neven from the heart of the major, who did not easily despair. John\nMangles felt himself growing mad at sight of the sad dejection of Mary\nGrant, thus separated from her brother. Glenarvan thought of that\nterrible request of Lady Helena, who, rather than yield to torture or\nslavery, preferred to die by his hand. Could he summon this fearful\ncourage? As for an escape, that was plainly impossible. Ten warriors,\narmed to the teeth, guarded the entrance of the temple.\n\nMorning came at last. There had been no communication between the\nnatives and the prisoners. The hut contained a considerable quantity\nof food, which the unfortunates scarcely touched. Hunger gave place to\ngrief. The day passed without bringing a change or a hope. Doubtless\nthe hour for the dead chief's funeral and their torture would be the\nsame.\n\nHowever, although Glenarvan concluded that Kai-Koumou must have\nabandoned all idea of exchange, the major on this point retained a\ngleam of hope.\n\n\"Who knows,\" said he, reminding Glenarvan of the effect produced upon\nthe chief by the death of Kara-Tété,--\"who knows but that Kai-Koumou in\nreality feels obliged to you?\"\n\nBut, in spite of these observations, Glenarvan would no longer hope.\nThe next day also passed away without the preparations for torture\nbeing made. The reason of the delay was this.\n\nThe Maoris believe that the soul, for three days after death, inhabits\nthe body of the deceased, and therefore during this time the corpse\nremains unburied. This custom was rigorously observed, and for two days\nthe pah was deserted. Captain Mangles frequently stood on Wilson's\nshoulders and surveyed the fortification. No native was seen; only the\nsentinels guarded in turn at the door of their prison.\n\nBut on the third day the huts were opened. The savages, men, women,\nand children, to the number of several hundreds, assembled in the pah,\nsilent and calm.

But as Villefort saw\nhis father but seldom, and then only when absolutely obliged, and as he\nnever took any pains to please or gratify him when he was there, all\nthe old man’s happiness was centred in his granddaughter. Valentine, by\nmeans of her love, her patience, and her devotion, had learned to read\nin Noirtier’s look all the varied feelings which were passing in his\nmind. To this dumb language, which was so unintelligible to others, she\nanswered by throwing her whole soul into the expression of her\ncountenance, and in this manner were the conversations sustained\nbetween the blooming girl and the helpless invalid, whose body could\nscarcely be called a living one, but who, nevertheless, possessed a\nfund of knowledge and penetration, united with a will as powerful as\never although clogged by a body rendered utterly incapable of obeying\nits impulses.\n\nValentine had solved the problem, and was able easily to understand his\nthoughts, and to convey her own in return, and, through her untiring\nand devoted assiduity, it was seldom that, in the ordinary transactions\nof every-day life, she failed to anticipate the wishes of the living,\nthinking mind, or the wants of the almost inanimate body.\n\nAs to the servant, he had, as we have said, been with his master for\nfive-and-twenty years, therefore he knew all his habits, and it was\nseldom that Noirtier found it necessary to ask for anything, so prompt\nwas he in administering to all the necessities of the invalid.\n\nVillefort did not need the help of either Valentine or the domestic in\norder to carry on with his father the strange conversation which he was\nabout to begin. As we have said, he perfectly understood the old man’s\nvocabulary, and if he did not use it more often, it was only\nindifference and _ennui_ which prevented him from so doing. He\ntherefore allowed Valentine to go into the garden, sent away Barrois,\nand after having seated himself at his father’s right hand, while\nMadame de Villefort placed herself on the left, he addressed him thus:\n\n“I trust you will not be displeased, sir, that Valentine has not come\nwith us, or that I dismissed Barrois, for our conference will be one\nwhich could not with propriety be carried on in the presence of either.\nMadame de Villefort and I have a communication to make to you.”\n\nNoirtier’s face remained perfectly passive during this long preamble,\nwhile, on the contrary, Villefort’s eye was endeavoring to penetrate\ninto the inmost recesses of the old man’s heart.\n\n“This communication,” continued the procureur, in that cold and\ndecisive tone which seemed at once to preclude all discussion, “will,\nwe are sure, meet with your approbation.”\n\nThe eye of the invalid still retained that vacancy of expression which\nprevented his son from obtaining any knowledge of the feelings which\nwere passing in his mind; he listened, nothing more.\n\n“Sir,” resumed Villefort, “we are thinking of marrying Valentine.” Had\nthe old man’s face been moulded in wax it could not have shown less\nemotion at this news than was now to be traced there. “The marriage\nwill take place in less than three months,” said Villefort.\n\nNoirtier’s eye still retained its inanimate expression.\n\nMadame de Villefort now took her part in the conversation and added:\n\n“We thought this news would possess an interest for you, sir, who have\nalways entertained a great affection for Valentine; it therefore only\nnow remains for us to tell you the name of the young man for whom she\nis destined.

They were Lord\nGlenarvan and his companions.\n\n[Sidenote: A TESTING TIME.]\n\nThe evening before, the little party, led astray by the dense fog, had\nencamped in the midst of a numerous tribe of natives. About midnight,\nthe travelers, surprised in their sleep, were made prisoners and\ncarried on board the canoe. They had not yet been maltreated, but had\ntried in vain to resist. Their arms and ammunition were in the hands of\nthe savages, and their own bullets would have quickly stretched them on\nthe earth had they attempted to escape.\n\nThey were not long in learning, by the aid of a few English words which\nthe natives used, that, being driven back by the British troops, they\nwere returning, vanquished and weakened, to the regions of the upper\nWaikato. Their chief, after an obstinate resistance, in which he lost\nhis principal warriors, was now on his way to rouse again the river\ntribes. He was called Kai-Koumou, a terrible name, which signified\nin the native language \"he who eats the limbs of his enemy.\" He was\nbrave and bold, but his cruelty equaled his bravery. No pity could be\nexpected from him. His name was well known to the English soldiers, and\na price had been set upon his head by the governor of New Zealand.\n\nThis terrible catastrophe had come upon Glenarvan just as he was\nabout reaching the long-desired harbor of Auckland, whence he would\nhave returned to his native country. Yet, looking at his calm and\npassionless countenance, you could not have divined the depth of his\nanguish, for in his present critical situation he did not betray the\nextent of his misfortunes. He felt that he ought to set an example of\nfortitude to his wife and his companions, as being the husband and\nchief. Moreover, he was ready to die first for the common safety, if\ncircumstances should require it.\n\n[Sidenote: CHIEFS, CIVILIZED AND UNCIVILIZED.]\n\nHis companions were worthy of him; they shared his noble thoughts, and\ntheir calm and haughty appearance would scarcely have intimated that\nthey were being carried away to captivity and suffering. By common\nconsent, at Glenarvan's suggestion, they had resolved to feign a proud\nindifference in the presence of the savages. It was the only way of\ninfluencing those fierce natures.\n\n[Illustration: A boat might have been seen ascending the Waikato. It\nwas a canoe seventy feet long and five broad.]\n\nSince leaving the encampment, the natives, taciturn like all savages,\nhad scarcely spoken to each other. However, from a few words exchanged,\nGlenarvan perceived that they were acquainted with the English\nlanguage. He therefore resolved to question the chief in regard to the\nfate that was in store for them. Addressing Kai-Koumou, he said, in a\nfearless tone:\n\n\"Where are you taking us, chief?\"\n\nKai-Koumou gazed at him coldly without answering.\n\n\"Say, what do you expect to do with us?\" continued Glenarvan.\n\nThe chief's eyes blazed with a sudden light, and in a stern voice he\nreplied:\n\n\"To exchange you, if your friends will ransom you; to kill you, if they\nrefuse.\"\n\nGlenarvan asked no more, but hope returned to his heart. Doubtless,\nsome chiefs of the Maori tribe had fallen into the hands of the\nEnglish, and the natives would attempt to recover them by way of\nexchange; their situation, therefore, was not one for despair.\n\nMeantime the canoe rapidly ascended the river.

To see India is an idea that I have cherished all my\nlife. It is my brightest dream, which shall be realized at last in the\ncountry of the elephants and the Thugs.\"\n\n\"Then you would not care to visit another country?\"\n\n\"No, my lord; it would be even disagreeable, for I have letters from\nLord Somerset to the governor-general of India, and a mission from the\nGeographical Society which I must fulfil.\"\n\n\"Ah! you have a mission?\"\n\n\"Yes, a useful and curious voyage to undertake, the programme of\nwhich has been arranged by my scientific friend and colleague, M.\nVivien de Saint Martin. It is to follow in the steps of the brothers\nSchlagintweit, and many other celebrated travelers. I hope to succeed\nwhere Missionary Krick unfortunately failed in 1846. In a word, I wish\nto discover the course of the Yaroo-tsang-bo-tsoo, which waters Thibet,\nand finally to settle whether this river does not join the Brahmapootra\nin the northeast part of Assam. A gold medal is promised to that\ntraveler who shall succeed in supplying this much-needed information on\nIndian geography.\"\n\nPaganel was grandiloquent. He spoke with a lofty animation, and was\ncarried away in the rapid flight of imagination. It would have been\nas impossible to check him as to stay the Rhine at the Falls of\nSchaffhausen.\n\n\"Monsieur Jacques Paganel,\" said Lord Glenarvan, after a moment\nof silence, \"that is certainly a fine voyage, and one for which\nscience would be very grateful; but I will not further prolong your\nignorance. For the present, you must give up the pleasure of seeing\nIndia.\"\n\n\n\"Give it up! And why?\"\n\n\"Because you are turning your back upon the Indian peninsula.\"\n\n\"How? Captain Burton----\"\n\n\"I am not Captain Burton,\" replied John Mangles.\n\n\"But the Scotia?\"\n\n\"This vessel is not the Scotia.\"\n\nPaganel's amazement cannot be depicted. He looked first at Lord\nGlenarvan, always serious; then at Lady Helena and Miss Grant, whose\nfeatures expressed a sympathetic disappointment; and finally at Captain\nMangles, who was smiling, and the imperturbable major. Then, raising\nhis shoulders and drawing down his glasses from his forehead to his\neyes, he exclaimed,--\n\n\"What a joke!\"\n\nBut at that his eyes fell upon the steering wheel, on which were\ninscribed these two words, thus:\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"The Duncan! the Duncan!\" he cried in a tone of real despair; and,\nleaping down the companion-way, he rushed to his cabin.\n\nWhen the unfortunate geographer had disappeared, no one on board,\nexcept the major, could retain gravity, and the laugh was communicated\neven to the sailors. To mistake the railroad was not so bad; to take\nthe train to Dumbarton, instead of Edinburgh, would do. But to mistake\nthe vessel, and be sailing to Chili, when he wished to go to India, was\nthe height of absent-mindedness.\n\n[Sidenote: ABSENT-MINDEDNESS.]\n\n\"On the whole, I am not astonished at this on the part of Jacques\nPaganel,\" said Glenarvan; \"he is noted for such blunders.

His geographical labors, his reports\non modern discoveries, published in the bulletins of the Society, his\ncorrespondence with the entire world, had made him one of the most\ndistinguished scientific men of France.

It was accepted, and Glenarvan and\nhis learned friend, taking leave of their companions, reascended the\nstream under the guidance of the Patagonian.\n\nThey proceeded at a good pace for an hour and a half, taking long\nstrides to keep up to the giant Thalcave. All the region was charming,\nand of a rich fertility. The grassy pastures succeeded each other,\nand could easily have fed thousands of cattle. Large ponds, united by\na winding chain of streams, gave these plains a verdant moisture.\nBlack-headed swans sported on the mirror-like surface, and disputed the\nempire of the waters with numberless ostriches that gamboled over the\nplains, while the brilliant feathered tribes were in wonderful variety.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nJacques Paganel proceeded from admiration to ecstasy. Exclamations\nof delight continually escaped his lips, to the astonishment of the\nPatagonian, who thought it very natural that there should be birds in\nthe air, swans on the lakes, and grass on the prairies. The geographer\nhad no reason to regret his walk, or complain of its length. He\nscarcely believed himself started, or that the encampment would soon\ncome in sight.\n\nThis tolderia was at the bottom of a narrow valley among the mountains.\nHere in huts of branches lived thirty wandering natives, grazing\nlarge herds of milch cows, sheep, cattle and horses. Thus they roamed\nfrom one pasture to another, always finding a repast ready for their\nfour-footed companions.\n\n[Sidenote: GLENARVAN GOING TO MARKET.]\n\nThalcave took upon himself the negotiation, which was not long. In\nreturn for seven small Argentine horses, all saddled, a hundred pounds\nof dried meat, a few measures of rice, and some leathern bottles for\nwater, the Indians received twenty ounces of gold, the value of which\nthey perfectly understood. Glenarvan would have bought another horse\nfor the Patagonian, but he intimated that it was unnecessary.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe bargain concluded, Glenarvan took leave of his new \"providers,\" as\nPaganel expressed it, and returned to the encampment. His arrival was\nwelcomed by cries of joy at sight of the provisions and horses. Every\none ate with avidity. Robert partook of some nourishment; he had almost\nentirely regained his strength, and the remainder of the day was passed\nin perfect rest. Various subjects were alluded to: the absent dear\nones, the Duncan, Captain Mangles, his brave crew, and Harry Grant who\nwas, perhaps, not far distant.\n\nAs for Paganel, he did not leave the Indian. He became Thalcave's\nshadow, and could not remain quiet in the presence of a real\nPatagonian, in comparison with whom he would have passed for a dwarf.\nHe overwhelmed the grave Indian with Spanish phrases, to which the\nlatter quietly listened. The geographer studied this time without a\nbook, and was often heard repeating words aloud.\n\n\"If I do not get the accent,\" said he to the major, \"you must not be\nangry with me.

Not a leaf stirred on the tree, not a ripple curled\nthe surface of the waters. Even the air seemed to fail, as if some\nhuge pneumatic machine had rarefied it. A strong electric current was\nperceptible in the atmosphere, and every creature felt it course along\nthe nerves. Glenarvan, Paganel, and Robert were sensibly affected by\nthese electric currents.\n\n\"We shall have a storm,\" said Paganel.\n\n\"You are not afraid of thunder?\" asked Glenarvan of the boy.\n\n\"Oh, no, my lord,\" replied Robert.\n\n\"Well, so much the better; for the storm is now not far distant.\"\n\n\"And it will be violent,\" continued Paganel, \"so far as I can judge\nfrom the state of the sky.\"\n\n\"It is not the storm that troubles me,\" said Glenarvan, \"but the\ntorrents of rain with which it will be accompanied.

The mass of\nclouds now covered it entirely. A faint line of light towards the\nhorizon was scarcely discernible in the dimness. The sombre appearance\nof the water had increased, and between the dark mass below and the\nclouds above there was scarcely a separation. At the same time all\nperception seemed dulled; and a leaden torpor rested upon both eyes and\nears, while the silence was profound.\n\n\"Let us go down,\" said Glenarvan; \"the lightning will soon be here.\"\n\nHis two companions and himself slid down the smooth branches, and were\nsomewhat surprised to find themselves in a remarkable kind of twilight,\nwhich was produced by myriads of luminous objects that crossed each\nother and buzzed on the surface of the water.\n\n\"Phosphorescences?\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\"No,\" replied Paganel, \"but phosphorescent insects, real\nglow-worms,--living diamonds, and not expensive, of which the ladies of\nBuenos Ayres make magnificent ornaments for themselves.\"\n\n\"What!\" cried Robert, \"are these things, that fly like sparks, insects?\"\n\n\"Yes, my boy.\"\n\nRobert caught one of the brilliant creatures. Paganel was right. It\nwas a kind of large beetle, an inch in length, to which the Indians\ngive the name of \"tuco-tuco.\" This curious insect threw out flashes at\ntwo points situated in front of its sheath, and its light would have\nenabled one to read in the darkness. Paganel, on bringing it close to\nhis watch, saw that it was ten o'clock.\n\nGlenarvan now joined the major and the three sailors, and gave them\ninstructions for the night. A terrible storm was to be expected. After\nthe first rollings of the thunder, the wind would doubtless break forth\nand the tree be violently shaken. It was, therefore, advisable for\nevery one to tie himself firmly to the bed of branches that had been\nappropriated to him.

The main-sails were set, and the mast was bent with the\nforce of the wind.\n\n\"To the windlass!\" cried the captain.\n\nGlenarvan, Mulready, and Robert on one side, and Paganel, the major,\nand Olbinett on the other, bore down upon the handles that moved the\nmachine. At the same time the captain and Wilson added their efforts to\nthose of their companions.\n\n\"Down! down!\" cried the young captain; \"all together!\"\n\nThe cables were stretched taut under the powerful action of the\nwindlass. The anchors held fast, and did not drag. But they must be\nquick, for high tide lasts only a few moments, and the water would not\nbe long in lowering.\n\nThey redoubled their efforts. The wind blew violently, and forced the\nsails against the mast. A few tremors were felt in the hull, and the\nbrig seemed on the point of rising. Perhaps a little more power would\nsuffice to draw her from the sand.\n\n\"Helena! Mary!\" cried Glenarvan.\n\nThe two ladies came and joined their efforts to those of their\ncompanions. A final crack was heard, but that was all! The experiment\nhad failed. The tide was already beginning to ebb, and it was evident\nthat, even with the aid of wind and tide, this insufficient crew could\nnot float their ship.\n\nAs their first plan had failed, it was necessary to have recourse to\nthe second without delay. It was plain that they could not raise the\nMacquarie, and that the only way was to abandon her. To wait on board\nfor the uncertain arrival of assistance would have been folly and\nmadness.\n\nThe captain therefore proposed to construct a raft strong enough to\nconvey the passengers and a sufficient quantity of provisions to the\nNew Zealand coast. It was not a time for discussion, but for action.\nThe work was accordingly begun, and considerably advanced when night\ninterrupted them.\n\nIn the evening, after supper, while Lady Helena and Mary Grant were\nreposing in their berths, Paganel and his friends conversed seriously\nas they paced the deck. The geographer had asked Captain Mangles\nwhether the raft could not follow the coast as far as Auckland, instead\nof landing the passengers at once.

Valentine instantly ran\ndown. The doctor was a friend of the family, and at the same time one\nof the cleverest men of the day, and very fond of Valentine, whose\nbirth he had witnessed. He had himself a daughter about her age, but\nwhose life was one continued source of anxiety and fear to him from her\nmother having been consumptive.\n\n“Oh,” said Valentine, “we have been waiting for you with such\nimpatience, dear M. d’Avrigny.

It must have been delirium;\nshe fancies, too, that she saw a phantom enter her chamber and even\nheard the noise it made on touching her glass.”\n\n“It is singular,” said the doctor; “I was not aware that Madame de\nSaint-Méran was subject to such hallucinations.”\n\n“It is the first time I ever saw her in this condition,” said\nValentine; “and this morning she frightened me so that I thought her\nmad; and my father, who you know is a strong-minded man, himself\nappeared deeply impressed.”\n\n“We will go and see,” said the doctor; “what you tell me seems very\nstrange.” The notary here descended, and Valentine was informed that\nher grandmother was alone.\n\n“Go upstairs,” she said to the doctor.\n\n“And you?”\n\n“Oh, I dare not—she forbade my sending for you; and, as you say, I am\nmyself agitated, feverish and out of sorts.

He allowed this bloody orgy an hour to reach its utmost\nintensity. The last act of the funeral was played with the usual rites.\n\nThe bodies of Kara-Tété and his wife were taken up, and their limbs\nbent and gathered against the stomach, according to the New Zealand\ncustom. The place for the tomb had been chosen outside of the\nfortification, about two miles distant, on the summit of a small\nmountain, called Maunganamu, situated on the right shore of the lake.\n\nThither the bodies were to be carried. Two very rude palanquins, or\nrather litters, were brought to the foot of the mound. The corpses,\nfolded together, in a sitting posture, and tied in their clothes by a\ngirdle of withes, were placed on this primitive bier. Four warriors\nbore it between them, and the entire tribe, chanting the funeral hymn,\nfollowed them in procession to the place of burial.\n\nThe captives, who were always watched, saw them leave the inner\ninclosure of the pah, and then the songs and cries gradually died away.\nFor about half an hour this funeral escort continued in sight, in the\ndepths of the valley. Finally they perceived it again winding along\nthe mountain paths. The distance gave a fantastic appearance to the\nundulating movements of the long, sinuous column.\n\nThe tribe stopped at the summit of the mountain, which was eight\nhundred feet high, at the place prepared for Kara-Tété's interment.\nA common Maori would have had only a hole and a heap of stones for a\ngrave; but for a powerful and dreaded chief, destined doubtless for a\nspeedy deification, a tomb worthy of his exploits was reserved.\n\n[Sidenote: THE LAST NIGHT.]\n\nThe sepulchre had been surrounded by palisades, while stakes,\nornamented with faces reddened with ochre, stood beside the grave\nwhere the bodies were to lie. The relatives had not forgotten that the\n\"waidoua\" (the spirit of the dead) feeds on substantial nourishment\nlike the body during this perishable life. Food had therefore been\ndeposited in the inclosure, together with the weapons and clothes of\nthe deceased.\n\nNothing was wanting for the comfort of the tomb. Husband and wife were\nlaid side by side, and then covered with earth and grass after a series\nof renewed lamentations. Then the procession silently descended the\nmountain, and now no one could ascend it under penalty of death, for it\nwas tabooed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LI.\n\nSTRANGELY LIBERATED.\n\n\nJust as the sun was disappearing behind Lake Taupo, the captives were\nled back to their prison. They were not to leave it again until the\nsummit of the Wahiti mountains should kindle with the first beams of\nthe day. One night remained to prepare for death. In spite of the\nfaintness, in spite of the horror with which they were seized, they\nshared their repast in common.\n\n\"We shall need all the strength possible to face death,\" said\nGlenarvan. \"We must show these barbarians how Europeans and Christians\ncan die.\"\n\nThe meal being finished, Lady Helena repeated the evening prayer aloud,\nwhile all her companions, with uncovered heads, joined her.

Glenarvan was, therefore, about to open the\nconversation on a new topic, to profit by the information received from\nAyrton, when the major, addressing him, said:\n\n\"You were quartermaster of the Britannia?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Ayrton.\n\nBut perceiving that a certain feeling of distrust, a doubt, however\nslight, had suggested this inquiry, he added,--\n\n\"I saved my contract from the wreck.\"\n\nHe immediately left the room in search of this authoritative document.\nDuring his absence, which lasted but a few moments, Mr. O'Moore said:\n\n\"My lord, I will answer for it that Ayrton is an honest man.

But ought we to suppose that,\nlike you, they have been carried to the north?\"\n\n\"It is quite likely, sir,\" replied Ayrton. \"The hostile tribes would\nhardly remain in the neighborhood of the English provinces.\"\n\n\"This fact will complicate our search,\" said Glenarvan, quite\ndisconcerted. \"How shall we find the traces of the prisoners in the\ninterior of so vast a continent?\"\n\nA prolonged silence followed this remark.

Towards noon they had to pass around\nthe shores of a small lake, the picturesque reservoir of all the\nneighboring streams which flowed into it.\n\nAbove the lake extended vast \"llanos,\" lofty plains, covered with\ngrass, where the herds of the Indians grazed. Then they came upon a\nswamp which extended to the south and north, but which the instinct\nof the mules enabled them to avoid. Soon Fort Ballenare appeared on a\nrocky peak which it crowned with its dismantled walls. The ascent had\nalready become abrupt and stony, and the pebbles, loosened by the hoofs\nof the mules, rolled under their feet in a rattling torrent.\n\nThe road now became difficult, and even perilous. The steepness\nincreased, the walls on either side approached each other more and\nmore, while the precipices yawned frightfully. The mules advanced\ncautiously in single file, with their noses to the ground, scenting the\nway.\n\nNow and then, at a sudden turn, the madrina disappeared, and the little\ncaravan was then guided by the distant tinkling of her bell. Sometimes,\ntoo, the capricious windings of the path would bend the column into\ntwo parallel lines, and the catapaz could talk to the peons, while a\ncrevasse, scarcely two fathoms wide, but two hundred deep, formed an\nimpassable abyss between them.\n\nUnder these conditions it was difficult to distinguish the course. The\nalmost incessant action of subterranean and volcanic agency changes\nthe road, and the landmarks are never the same. Therefore the catapaz\nhesitated, stopped, looked about him, examined the form of the rocks,\nand searched on the crumbling stones for the tracks of Indians.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nGlenarvan followed in the steps of his guide. He perceived, he _felt_,\nhis embarrassment, increasing with the difficulties of the way. He did\nnot dare to question him, but thought that it was better to trust to\nthe instinct of the muleteers and mules.\n\nFor an hour longer the catapaz wandered at a venture, but always\nseeking the more elevated parts of the mountain.

A few moments after\nthey were led back to the temple that served as their prison; but\nRobert Grant and Paganel were no longer with them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER L.\n\nTHE CHIEF'S FUNERAL.\n\n\nKai-Koumou, according to a custom quite ordinary in New Zealand, joined\nthe rank of priest to that of chief, and could, therefore, extend to\npersons or objects the superstitious protection of the taboo.\n\nThe taboo, which is common to the tribes of Polynesia, has the power\nto prohibit at once all connection with the object or person tabooed.\nAccording to the Maori religion, whoever should lay his sacrilegious\nhand on what is declared taboo would be punished with death by the\noffended god; and in case the divinity should delay to avenge his own\ninsult, the priests would not fail to excite his anger.\n\nAs for the prisoners confined in the temple, the taboo had rescued\nthem from the fury of the tribe. Some of the natives, the friends and\npartisans of Kai-Koumou, had stopped suddenly at the command of their\nchief, and had protected the captives.\n\n[Sidenote: THE TORTURES OF SUSPENSE.]\n\nGlenarvan, however, was not blind to the fate that was reserved for\nhim. Only his death could atone for the murder of a chief. Among savage\nraces death is always preceded by a protracted torture. He therefore\nexpected to cruelly expiate the righteous indignation that had nerved\nhis arm, but hoped that Kai-Koumou's rage would fall only on himself.\n\nWhat a night he and his companions passed! Who could depict their\nanguish, or measure their sufferings? Neither poor Robert nor brave\nPaganel had reappeared. But how could they doubt their fate? Were they\nnot the first victims of the natives' vengeance? All hope had vanished\neven from the heart of the major, who did not easily despair. John\nMangles felt himself growing mad at sight of the sad dejection of Mary\nGrant, thus separated from her brother. Glenarvan thought of that\nterrible request of Lady Helena, who, rather than yield to torture or\nslavery, preferred to die by his hand. Could he summon this fearful\ncourage? As for an escape, that was plainly impossible. Ten warriors,\narmed to the teeth, guarded the entrance of the temple.\n\nMorning came at last. There had been no communication between the\nnatives and the prisoners. The hut contained a considerable quantity\nof food, which the unfortunates scarcely touched. Hunger gave place to\ngrief. The day passed without bringing a change or a hope. Doubtless\nthe hour for the dead chief's funeral and their torture would be the\nsame.\n\nHowever, although Glenarvan concluded that Kai-Koumou must have\nabandoned all idea of exchange, the major on this point retained a\ngleam of hope.\n\n\"Who knows,\" said he, reminding Glenarvan of the effect produced upon\nthe chief by the death of Kara-Tété,--\"who knows but that Kai-Koumou in\nreality feels obliged to you?\"\n\nBut, in spite of these observations, Glenarvan would no longer hope.\nThe next day also passed away without the preparations for torture\nbeing made. The reason of the delay was this.\n\nThe Maoris believe that the soul, for three days after death, inhabits\nthe body of the deceased, and therefore during this time the corpse\nremains unburied. This custom was rigorously observed, and for two days\nthe pah was deserted. Captain Mangles frequently stood on Wilson's\nshoulders and surveyed the fortification. No native was seen; only the\nsentinels guarded in turn at the door of their prison.\n\nBut on the third day the huts were opened. The savages, men, women,\nand children, to the number of several hundreds, assembled in the pah,\nsilent and calm. Kai-Koumou came out of his house, and, surrounded by\nthe principal warriors of his tribe, took his place on a mound several\nfeet high in the centre of the fortification.

Glenarvan, with a wild look, gazed\nat the fire and water leagued against him, not knowing what aid to\nimplore of Heaven.\n\nThe storm had now begun to abate; but it had developed in the air a\ngreat quantity of vapor, which the electric phenomena were about to\nset in violent commotion. To the south an enormous water-spout was\ngradually forming,--an inverted cone of mist, uniting the raging waters\nbelow to the stormy clouds above. It advanced revolving with frightful\nrapidity, collected at its centre a liquid column, and by a powerful\nattraction, caused by its gyratory motion, drew towards it all the\nsurrounding currents of air.\n\n[Sidenote: A STRANGE BARK.]\n\nIn a few moments the gigantic water-spout struck the ombu and enveloped\nit in its watery folds. The tree was shaken to its very base, so that\nGlenarvan might have thought that the alligators had attacked it\nwith their powerful jaws and were uprooting it from the ground. His\ncompanions and he, clinging to one another, felt the mighty tree give\nway and fall, and saw its flaming branches plunge into the tumultuous\nwaters with a frightful hiss. It was the work of a second. The\nwater-spout had passed, to exert elsewhere its destructive violence,\nand pumping the waters of the plain as if it would exhaust them.\n\nThe tree now, loosened from its moorings, floated onward under the\ncombined impulses of wind and current. The alligators had fled, except\none which crawled along the upturned roots and advanced with open jaws;\nbut Mulready, seizing a large brand, struck the creature so powerful\na blow that he broke its back. The vanquished animal sank in the\neddies of the torrent, still lashing his formidable tail with terrible\nviolence.\n\nGlenarvan and his companions, delivered from these voracious creatures,\ntook refuge on the branches to leeward of the fire, while the tree,\nwrapped by the blast of the hurricane in glowing sheets of flame,\nfloated on like a burning ship in the darkness of the night.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI.\n\nTHE RETURN ON BOARD.\n\n\nFor two hours the tree floated on the immense lake without reaching\n_terra firma_. The flames had gradually died out, and thus the\nprincipal danger of this terrible voyage had vanished. The current,\nstill keeping its original direction, flowed from southwest to\nnortheast; the darkness, though illumined now and then by flashes, had\nbecome profound, and Paganel sought in vain for his bearings. But the\nstorm was abating, the large drops of rain gave place to light spray\nthat was scattered by the wind, while the huge distended clouds were\ncrossed by light bands.\n\nThe tree advanced rapidly on the impetuous torrent, gliding with\nsurprising swiftness, as if some powerful propelling means were\ninclosed within its trunk. There was as yet no certainty that they\nwould not float on thus for many days. About three o'clock in the\nmorning, however, the major observed that the roots now and then struck\nthe bottom. Tom Austin, by means of a long branch, carefully sounded,\nand declared that the water was growing shallow. Twenty minutes later,\na shock was felt, and the progress of the tree was checked.\n\n\"Land! land!\" cried Paganel, in ringing tones.\n\nThe ends of the charred branches had struck against a hillock on the\nground, and never were navigators more delighted to land.

He could not, however,\nreconcile himself to the idea of returning on board without Captain\nGrant, and failing so completely in his search; and did not therefore,\nas usual, give the orders for departure. But the major assumed the\ntask of saddling the horses, renewing the provisions, and making his\narrangements for the journey. Thanks to his activity, the little party,\nat eight o'clock in the morning, was on its way down the grassy slopes\nof the Tandil Sierra.\n\nGlenarvan, with Robert at his side, galloped on in silence. His\nlordship's bold and resolute character did not permit him to accept\nthis disappointment calmly. His heart beat violently, and his brain was\non fire. Paganel, tormented by the mystery of the document, arranged\nthe words in every way, as if to draw from them a new meaning. Thalcave\nsilently resigned himself to Thaouka's sagacity.

A few moments after\nthey were led back to the temple that served as their prison; but\nRobert Grant and Paganel were no longer with them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER L.\n\nTHE CHIEF'S FUNERAL.\n\n\nKai-Koumou, according to a custom quite ordinary in New Zealand, joined\nthe rank of priest to that of chief, and could, therefore, extend to\npersons or objects the superstitious protection of the taboo.\n\nThe taboo, which is common to the tribes of Polynesia, has the power\nto prohibit at once all connection with the object or person tabooed.\nAccording to the Maori religion, whoever should lay his sacrilegious\nhand on what is declared taboo would be punished with death by the\noffended god; and in case the divinity should delay to avenge his own\ninsult, the priests would not fail to excite his anger.\n\nAs for the prisoners confined in the temple, the taboo had rescued\nthem from the fury of the tribe. Some of the natives, the friends and\npartisans of Kai-Koumou, had stopped suddenly at the command of their\nchief, and had protected the captives.\n\n[Sidenote: THE TORTURES OF SUSPENSE.]\n\nGlenarvan, however, was not blind to the fate that was reserved for\nhim. Only his death could atone for the murder of a chief. Among savage\nraces death is always preceded by a protracted torture. He therefore\nexpected to cruelly expiate the righteous indignation that had nerved\nhis arm, but hoped that Kai-Koumou's rage would fall only on himself.\n\nWhat a night he and his companions passed! Who could depict their\nanguish, or measure their sufferings? Neither poor Robert nor brave\nPaganel had reappeared. But how could they doubt their fate? Were they\nnot the first victims of the natives' vengeance? All hope had vanished\neven from the heart of the major, who did not easily despair. John\nMangles felt himself growing mad at sight of the sad dejection of Mary\nGrant, thus separated from her brother. Glenarvan thought of that\nterrible request of Lady Helena, who, rather than yield to torture or\nslavery, preferred to die by his hand. Could he summon this fearful\ncourage? As for an escape, that was plainly impossible. Ten warriors,\narmed to the teeth, guarded the entrance of the temple.\n\nMorning came at last. There had been no communication between the\nnatives and the prisoners. The hut contained a considerable quantity\nof food, which the unfortunates scarcely touched. Hunger gave place to\ngrief. The day passed without bringing a change or a hope. Doubtless\nthe hour for the dead chief's funeral and their torture would be the\nsame.\n\nHowever, although Glenarvan concluded that Kai-Koumou must have\nabandoned all idea of exchange, the major on this point retained a\ngleam of hope.\n\n\"Who knows,\" said he, reminding Glenarvan of the effect produced upon\nthe chief by the death of Kara-Tété,--\"who knows but that Kai-Koumou in\nreality feels obliged to you?\"\n\nBut, in spite of these observations, Glenarvan would no longer hope.\nThe next day also passed away without the preparations for torture\nbeing made. The reason of the delay was this.\n\nThe Maoris believe that the soul, for three days after death, inhabits\nthe body of the deceased, and therefore during this time the corpse\nremains unburied. This custom was rigorously observed, and for two days\nthe pah was deserted. Captain Mangles frequently stood on Wilson's\nshoulders and surveyed the fortification. No native was seen; only the\nsentinels guarded in turn at the door of their prison.\n\nBut on the third day the huts were opened. The savages, men, women,\nand children, to the number of several hundreds, assembled in the pah,\nsilent and calm.

I could\nnot yield; but with Harry Grant, when his resolution is taken, all\nresistance is impossible.

Paganel and Robert, two children (a large and a small\none), felt no pleasure in introducing their heads into the national\nponcho (a large blanket with a hole in the centre), and their legs\ninto leathern stirrups. They would rather have seen their mules\nrichly caparisoned, with the Arab bit in their mouths, a long bridle\nof braided leather for a whip, and their heads adorned with metal\nornaments and the \"alforjas\" (double saddle-bags containing the\nprovisions).\n\n[Sidenote: LAND AND WATER.]\n\nPaganel, always absent-minded, received three or four kicks from his\nexcellent animal just as he was mounting. Once in the saddle, however,\nwith his inseparable telescope in a sling and his feet confined in the\nstirrups, he confided himself to the sagacity of his beast, and had\nno reason to repent. As for young Robert, he showed from the first a\nremarkable capacity for becoming an excellent horseman.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThey started.

{"claim_id": "107_0", "claim": "Noirtier Napoleon’s triumph at Waterloo ended his hopes", "evidence": "ith ambition and its first successes.\n\n\n\n Chapter 13. The Hundred Days\n\nM. Noirtier was a true prophet, and things progressed rapidly, as he\nhad predicted. Everyone knows the history of the famous return from\nElba, a return which was unprecedented in the past, and will probably\nremain without a counterpart in the future.\n\nLouis XVIII. made but a faint attempt to parry this unexpected blow;\nthe monarchy he had scarcely reconstructed tottered on its precarious\nfoundation, and at a sign from the emperor the incongruous structure of\nancient prejudices and new ideas fell to the ground. Villefort,\ntherefore, gained nothing save the king’s gratitude (which was rather\nlikely to injure him at the present time) and the cross of the Legion\nof Honor, which he had the prudence not to wear, although M. de Blacas\nhad duly forwarded the brevet.\n\nNapoleon would, doubtless, have deprived Villefort of his office had it\nnot been for Noirtier, who was all powerful at court, and thus the\nGirondin of ’93 and the Senator of 1806 protected him who so lately had\nbeen his protector. All Villefort’s influence barely enabled him to\nstifle the secret Dantès had so nearly divulged. The king’s procureur\nalone was deprived of his office, being suspected of royalism.\n\nHowever, scarcely was the imperial power established—that is, scarcely\nhad the emperor re-entered the Tuileries and begun to issue orders from\nthe closet into which we have introduced our readers,—he found on the\ntable there Louis XVIII.’s half-filled snuff-box,—scarcely had this\noccurred when Marseilles began, in spite of the authorities, to\nrekindle the flames of civil war, always smouldering in the south, and\nit required but little to excite the populace to acts of far greater\nviolence than the shouts and insults with which they assailed the\nroyalists whenever they ventured abroad.\n\n0159m\n\n\n\nOwing to this change, the worthy shipowner became at that moment—we\nwill not say all powerful, because Morrel was a prudent and rather a\ntimid man, so much so, that many of the most zealous partisans of\nBonaparte accused him of “moderation”—but sufficiently influential to\nmake a demand in favor of Dantès.\n\nVillefort retained his place, but his marriage was put off until a more\nfavorable opportunity. If the emperor remained on the throne, Gérard\nrequired a different alliance to aid his career; if Louis XVIII.\nreturned, the influence of M. de Saint-Méran, like his own, could be\nvastly increased, and the marriage be still more suitable. The deputy\nprocureur was, therefore, the first magistrate of Marseilles, when one\nmorning his door opened, and M. Morrel was announced.\n\nAnyone else would have hastened to receive him; but Villefort was a man\nof ability, and he knew this would be a sign of weakness. He made\nMorrel wait in the antechamber, although he had no one with him, for\nthe simple reason that the king’s procureur always makes everyone wait,\nand after passing a quarter of an hour in reading the papers, he\nordered M. Morrel to be admitted.\n\nMorrel expected Villefort would be dejected; he found him as he had\nfound him six weeks before, calm, firm, and full of that glacial\npoliteness, that most insurmountable barrier which separates the\nwell-bred from the vulgar man.\n\nHe had entered Villefort’s office expecting that the magistrate would\ntremble at the sight of him; on the contrary, he felt a cold shudder\nall over him when he saw Villefort sitting there with his elbow on his\ndesk, and his head leaning on his hand. He stopped at the door;\nVillefort gazed at him as if he had some difficulty in recognizing him;\nthen, after a brief interval, during which the honest shipowner turned\nhis hat in his hands,\n\n“M. Morrel, I believe?” said Villefort.\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“Come nearer,” said the magistrate, with a patronizing wave of the\nhand, “and tell me to what circumstance I owe the honor of this visit.”\n\n“Do you not guess, monsieur?” asked Morrel.\n\n“Not in the least; but if I can serve you in any way I shall be\ndelighted.”\n", "label": "CONTRADICT"}

The\nnames have been purposely concealed; my father himself does not know\nwho this president was, and if he knows, he cannot tell you; proper\nnames are not in the dictionary.”\n\n“Oh, misery,” cried Franz: “the only hope which sustained me and\nenabled me to read to the end was that of knowing, at least, the name\nof him who killed my father! Sir, sir,” cried he, turning to Noirtier,\n“do what you can—make me understand in some way!”\n\n“Yes,” replied Noirtier.\n\n“Oh, mademoiselle, mademoiselle!” cried Franz, “your grandfather says\nhe can indicate the person. Help me,—lend me your assistance!”\n\nNoirtier looked at the dictionary. Franz took it with a nervous\ntrembling, and repeated the letters of the alphabet successively, until\nhe came to M. At that letter the old man signified “Yes.”\n\n“M,” repeated Franz. The young man’s finger, glided over the words, but\nat each one Noirtier answered by a negative sign. Valentine hid her\nhead between her hands. At length, Franz arrived at the word MYSELF.\n\n40046m\n\n\n\n“Yes!”\n\n“You!” cried Franz, whose hair stood on end; “you, M.

Franz\nfell powerless on a chair; Villefort opened the door and escaped, for\nthe idea had entered his mind to stifle the little remaining life in\nthe heart of this terrible old man.\n\n\n\n\n Chapter 76. Progress of Cavalcanti the Younger\n\nMeanwhile M. Cavalcanti the elder had returned to his service, not in\nthe army of his majesty the Emperor of Austria, but at the gaming-table\nof the baths of Lucca, of which he was one of the most assiduous\ncourtiers.

Fire, my friends, fire!\"\n\nBut he was too late. The condor had disappeared behind the lofty\nboulders. A second passed that seemed an eternity. Then the enormous\nbird reappeared, heavily laden, and rising slowly.\n\nA cry of horror was uttered. In the claws of the condor an inanimate\nbody was seen suspended and dangling. It was Robert Grant. The bird had\nraised him by his garments, and was now hovering in mid-air at least\none hundred and fifty feet above the encampment. He had perceived the\ntravelers, and was violently striving to escape with his heavy prey.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"May Robert's body be dashed upon these rocks,\" cried Glenarvan,\n\"rather than serve----\"\n\nHe did not finish, but, seizing Wilson's rifle, attempted to take aim\nat the condor.

His\ncompanions closely followed him.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Sidenote: \"THE LOST IS FOUND.\"]\n\nWhen they arrived the bird was dead, and the body of Robert was hidden\nunder its great wings. Glenarvan threw himself upon the child, released\nhim from the talons of the condor, stretched him on the grass, and\npressed his ear to his breast.\n\nNever did a wilder cry of joy issue from human lips than when Glenarvan\nrose, exclaiming:\n\n\"He lives! he lives!\"\n\nIn an instant Robert was stripped of his garments, and his face bathed\nwith fresh water. He made a movement, opened his eyes, looked around,\nand uttered a few words:\n\n\"You, my lord--my father!----\"\n\nGlenarvan could not speak. Emotion stifled him, and, kneeling, he wept\nbeside this child so miraculously saved.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\nTHALCAVE.\n\n\nAfter the great danger that he had just escaped, Robert incurred\nanother, no less great,--that of being overwhelmed with caresses.\nHowever feeble he was still, not one of these good people could refrain\nfrom pressing him to his heart. But it must be confessed that these\nwell-meant embraces are not fatal, for the boy did not die.\n\nWhen his rescue was certain, thought reverted to his rescuer, and the\nmajor very naturally thought of looking around him. Fifty paces from\nthe stream, a man of lofty stature was standing, motionless, on one\nof the first ledges of the mountain. A long gun lay at his feet. This\nindividual, who had so suddenly appeared, had broad shoulders, and\nlong hair tied with leathern thongs. His height exceeded six feet, and\nhis bronzed face was red between his eyes and mouth, black below his\neyelids, and white on his forehead.

His leggings were of ox-hide, and fastened to the ankle with\nstraps regularly crossed.\n\nThe figure of this Patagonian was fine, and his face denoted real\nintelligence in spite of the colors that adorned (!) it.

Here is the book\nin which I practice daily the difficulties of the Spanish language!\nExamine it, major, and you will see whether I impose upon you.\"\n\nSo saying, Paganel groped in his numerous pockets. After searching a\nfew moments, he drew forth a volume in a very bad state, and presented\nit with an air of assurance. The major took the book, and looked at it.\n\n\"Well, what work is this?\" he asked.\n\n\"The Lusiad,\" replied Paganel; \"an admirable poem which----\"\n\n\"The Lusiad!\" cried Glenarvan.\n\n\"Yes, my friend, the Lusiad of the immortal Camoëns, nothing more or\nless.\"\n\n\"Camoëns!\" repeated Glenarvan; \"but, unfortunate friend, Camoëns was\na Portuguese!

Is it not\na mere joke? Have I done this? It is the confusion of languages, as at\nBabel. My friends! my friends! to start for India and arrive at Chili!\nto learn Spanish and speak Portuguese! this is too much, and, if it\ncontinues, I shall some day throw myself out of the window instead of\nmy cigar.\"\n\nTo hear Paganel take his blunder thus, to see his comical actions, it\nwas impossible to keep serious. Besides, he set the example himself.\n\n\"Laugh, my friends,\" said he, \"laugh with a will! you cannot laugh as\nmuch as I do at myself.\"\n\nAnd he uttered the most formidable peal of laughter that ever issued\nfrom the mouth of a geographer.\n\n\"But we are none the less without an interpreter,\" said the major.\n\n\"Oh, do not be troubled,\" replied Paganel. \"The Portuguese and Spanish\nresemble each other so much that I made a mistake. However, this very\nresemblance will soon enable me to rectify my error, and in a short\ntime I will thank this worthy Patagonian in the language he speaks so\nwell.\"\n\nPaganel was right, for he could soon exchange a few words with the\nnative. He even learned that his name was Thalcave, a word which\nsignifies in Araucanian \"the thunderer.\" This surname was doubtless\ngiven to him for his skill in the use of fire-arms.\n\n[Sidenote: BETTER PROSPECTS.]\n\nBut Glenarvan was particularly rejoiced to discover that the Patagonian\nwas a guide, and, moreover, a guide of the Pampas.

At\nthe end of three months he had learned to read. This was not enough—he\nmust now learn to write. The priest had a writing teacher at Rome make\nthree alphabets—one large, one middling, and one small; and pointed out\nto him that by the help of a sharp instrument he could trace the\nletters on a slate, and thus learn to write. The same evening, when the\nflock was safe at the farm, the little Luigi hastened to the smith at\nPalestrina, took a large nail, heated and sharpened it, and formed a\nsort of stylus. The next morning he gathered an armful of pieces of\nslate and began. At the end of three months he had learned to write.\nThe curate, astonished at his quickness and intelligence, made him a\npresent of pens, paper, and a penknife. This demanded new effort, but\nnothing compared to the first; at the end of a week he wrote as well\nwith this pen as with the stylus. The curate related the incident to\nthe Count of San-Felice, who sent for the little shepherd, made him\nread and write before him, ordered his attendant to let him eat with\nthe domestics, and to give him two piastres a month. With this, Luigi\npurchased books and pencils. He applied his imitative powers to\neverything, and, like Giotto, when young, he drew on his slate sheep,\nhouses, and trees. Then, with his knife, he began to carve all sorts of\nobjects in wood; it was thus that Pinelli, the famous sculptor, had\ncommenced.\n\n20105m\n\n\n\n“A girl of six or seven—that is, a little younger than Vampa—tended\nsheep on a farm near Palestrina; she was an orphan, born at Valmontone\nand was named Teresa. The two children met, sat down near each other,\nlet their flocks mingle together, played, laughed, and conversed\ntogether; in the evening they separated the Count of San-Felice’s flock\nfrom those of Baron Cervetri, and the children returned to their\nrespective farms, promising to meet the next morning. The next day they\nkept their word, and thus they grew up together. Vampa was twelve, and\nTeresa eleven. And yet their natural disposition revealed itself.\nBeside his taste for the fine arts, which Luigi had carried as far as\nhe could in his solitude, he was given to alternating fits of sadness\nand enthusiasm, was often angry and capricious, and always sarcastic.\nNone of the lads of Pampinara, Palestrina, or Valmontone had been able\nto gain any influence over him or even to become his companion. His\ndisposition (always inclined to exact concessions rather than to make\nthem) kept him aloof from all friendships. Teresa alone ruled by a\nlook, a word, a gesture, this impetuous character, which yielded\nbeneath the hand of a woman, and which beneath the hand of a man might\nhave broken, but could never have been bended. Teresa was lively and\ngay, but coquettish to excess. The two piastres that Luigi received\nevery month from the Count of San-Felice’s steward, and the price of\nall the little carvings in wood he sold at Rome, were expended in\near-rings, necklaces, and gold hairpins. So that, thanks to her\nfriend’s generosity, Teresa was the most beautiful and the best-attired\npeasant near Rome.\n\n“The two children grew up together, passing all their time with each\nother, and giving themselves up to the wild ideas of their different\ncharacters. Thus, in all their dreams, their wishes, and their\nconversations, Vampa saw himself the captain of a vessel, general of an\narmy, or governor of a province. Teresa saw herself rich, superbly\nattired, and attended by a train of liveried domestics. Then, when they\nhad thus passed the day in building castles in the air, they separated\ntheir flocks, and descended from the elevation of their dreams to the\nreality of their humble position.\n\n“One day the young shepherd told the count’s steward that he had seen a\nwolf come out of the Sabine mountains, and prowl ar", "label": "CONTRADICT"}

Under this treatment, performed with an extreme gentleness,\nthe child felt his strength revive, and it was plain that a few hours\nwould suffice to restore him.\n\nIt was therefore decided that that day and the following night should\nbe passed at the encampment. Besides, two important questions remained\nto be settled--food, and means of conveyance. Provisions and mules were\nboth wanting.\n\nFortunately Thalcave solved the difficulty. This guide, who was\naccustomed to conduct travelers along the Patagonian frontiers, and\nwas one of the most intelligent baqueanos of the country, engaged to\nfurnish Glenarvan all that his little party needed. He offered to take\nhim to a \"tolderia\" (encampment) of Indians, about four miles distant,\nwhere they would find everything necessary for the expedition. This\nproposal was made partly by gestures, partly by Spanish words which\nPaganel succeeded in understanding. It was accepted, and Glenarvan and\nhis learned friend, taking leave of their companions, reascended the\nstream under the guidance of the Patagonian.\n\nThey proceeded at a good pace for an hour and a half, taking long\nstrides to keep up to the giant Thalcave. All the region was charming,\nand of a rich fertility. The grassy pastures succeeded each other,\nand could easily have fed thousands of cattle. Large ponds, united by\na winding chain of streams, gave these plains a verdant moisture.\nBlack-headed swans sported on the mirror-like surface, and disputed the\nempire of the waters with numberless ostriches that gamboled over the\nplains, while the brilliant feathered tribes were in wonderful variety.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nJacques Paganel proceeded from admiration to ecstasy. Exclamations\nof delight continually escaped his lips, to the astonishment of the\nPatagonian, who thought it very natural that there should be birds in\nthe air, swans on the lakes, and grass on the prairies. The geographer\nhad no reason to regret his walk, or complain of its length. He\nscarcely believed himself started, or that the encampment would soon\ncome in sight.\n\nThis tolderia was at the bottom of a narrow valley among the mountains.\nHere in huts of branches lived thirty wandering natives, grazing\nlarge herds of milch cows, sheep, cattle and horses. Thus they roamed\nfrom one pasture to another, always finding a repast ready for their\nfour-footed companions.\n\n[Sidenote: GLENARVAN GOING TO MARKET.]\n\nThalcave took upon himself the negotiation, which was not long. In\nreturn for seven small Argentine horses, all saddled, a hundred pounds\nof dried meat, a few measures of rice, and some leathern bottles for\nwater, the Indians received twenty ounces of gold, the value of which\nthey perfectly understood. Glenarvan would have bought another horse\nfor the Patagonian, but he intimated that it was unnecessary.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe bargain concluded, Glenarvan took leave of his new \"providers,\" as\nPaganel expressed it, and returned to the encampment. His arrival was\nwelcomed by cries of joy at sight of the provisions and horses. Every\none ate with avidity. Robert partook of some nourishment; he had almost\nentirely regained his strength, and the remainder of the day was passed\nin perfect rest. Various subjects were alluded to: the absent dear\nones, the Duncan, Captain Mangles, his brave crew, and Harry Grant who\nwas, perhaps, not far distant.\n\nAs for Paganel, he did not leave the Indian. He became Thalcave's\nshadow, and could not remain quiet in the presence of a real\nPatagonian, in comparison with whom he would have passed for a dwarf.\nHe overwhelmed the grave Indian with Spanish phrases, to which the\nlatter quietly listened.

{"claim_id": "108_1", "claim": "Noirtier pinned on his son Villefort the hope that the boy would carry his ideals forward.", "evidence": "ith ambition and its first successes.\n\n\n\n Chapter 13. The Hundred Days\n\nM. Noirtier was a true prophet, and things progressed rapidly, as he\nhad predicted. Everyone knows the history of the famous return from\nElba, a return which was unprecedented in the past, and will probably\nremain without a counterpart in the future.\n\nLouis XVIII. made but a faint attempt to parry this unexpected blow;\nthe monarchy he had scarcely reconstructed tottered on its precarious\nfoundation, and at a sign from the emperor the incongruous structure of\nancient prejudices and new ideas fell to the ground. Villefort,\ntherefore, gained nothing save the king’s gratitude (which was rather\nlikely to injure him at the present time) and the cross of the Legion\nof Honor, which he had the prudence not to wear, although M. de Blacas\nhad duly forwarded the brevet.\n\nNapoleon would, doubtless, have deprived Villefort of his office had it\nnot been for Noirtier, who was all powerful at court, and thus the\nGirondin of ’93 and the Senator of 1806 protected him who so lately had\nbeen his protector. All Villefort’s influence barely enabled him to\nstifle the secret Dantès had so nearly divulged. The king’s procureur\nalone was deprived of his office, being suspected of royalism.\n\nHowever, scarcely was the imperial power established—that is, scarcely\nhad the emperor re-entered the Tuileries and begun to issue orders from\nthe closet into which we have introduced our readers,—he found on the\ntable there Louis XVIII.’s half-filled snuff-box,—scarcely had this\noccurred when Marseilles began, in spite of the authorities, to\nrekindle the flames of civil war, always smouldering in the south, and\nit required but little to excite the populace to acts of far greater\nviolence than the shouts and insults with which they assailed the\nroyalists whenever they ventured abroad.\n\n0159m\n\n\n\nOwing to this change, the worthy shipowner became at that moment—we\nwill not say all powerful, because Morrel was a prudent and rather a\ntimid man, so much so, that many of the most zealous partisans of\nBonaparte accused him of “moderation”—but sufficiently influential to\nmake a demand in favor of Dantès.\n\nVillefort retained his place, but his marriage was put off until a more\nfavorable opportunity. If the emperor remained on the throne, Gérard\nrequired a different alliance to aid his career; if Louis XVIII.\nreturned, the influence of M. de Saint-Méran, like his own, could be\nvastly increased, and the marriage be still more suitable. The deputy\nprocureur was, therefore, the first magistrate of Marseilles, when one\nmorning his door opened, and M. Morrel was announced.\n\nAnyone else would have hastened to receive him; but Villefort was a man\nof ability, and he knew this would be a sign of weakness. He made\nMorrel wait in the antechamber, although he had no one with him, for\nthe simple reason that the king’s procureur always makes everyone wait,\nand after passing a quarter of an hour in reading the papers, he\nordered M. Morrel to be admitted.\n\nMorrel expected Villefort would be dejected; he found him as he had\nfound him six weeks before, calm, firm, and full of that glacial\npoliteness, that most insurmountable barrier which separates the\nwell-bred from the vulgar man.\n\nHe had entered Villefort’s office expecting that the magistrate would\ntremble at the sight of him; on the contrary, he felt a cold shudder\nall over him when he saw Villefort sitting there with his elbow on his\ndesk, and his head leaning on his hand. He stopped at the door;\nVillefort gazed at him as if he had some difficulty in recognizing him;\nthen, after a brief interval, during which the honest shipowner turned\nhis hat in his hands,\n\n“M. Morrel, I believe?” said Villefort.\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“Come nearer,” said the magistrate, with a patronizing wave of the\nhand, “and tell me to what circumstance I owe the honor of this visit.”\n\n“Do you not guess, monsieur?” asked Morrel.\n\n“Not in the least; but if I can serve you in any way I shall be\ndelighted.”\n", "label": "SUPPORT"}

His fear was lest the governor, touched with\npity, might order him to be removed to better quarters, and thus\nseparate him from his young companion. But fortunately this was not the\ncase, and the governor left him, convinced that the poor madman, for\nwhom in his heart he felt a kind of affection, was only troubled with a\nslight indisposition.\n\nDuring this time, Edmond, seated on his bed with his head in his hands,\ntried to collect his scattered thoughts. Faria, since their first\nacquaintance, had been on all points so rational and logical, so\nwonderfully sagacious, in fact, that he could not understand how so\nmuch wisdom on all points could be allied with madness. Was Faria\ndeceived as to his treasure, or was all the world deceived as to Faria?\n\nDantès remained in his cell all day, not daring to return to his\nfriend, thinking thus to defer the moment when he should be convinced,\nonce for all, that the abbé was mad—such a conviction would be so\nterrible!\n\nBut, towards the evening after the hour for the customary visit had\ngone by, Faria, not seeing the young man appear, tried to move and get\nover the distance which separated them. Edmond shuddered when he heard\nthe painful efforts which the old man made to drag himself along; his\nleg was inert, and he could no longer make use of one arm. Edmond was\nobliged to assist him, for otherwise he would not have been able to\nenter by the small aperture which led to Dantès’ chamber.\n\n“Here I am, pursuing you remorselessly,” he said with a benignant\nsmile. “You thought to escape my munificence, but it is in vain. Listen\nto me.”\n\nEdmond saw there was no escape, and placing the old man on his bed, he\nseated himself on the stool beside him.\n\n“You know,” said the abbé, “that I was the secretary and intimate\nfriend of Cardinal Spada, the last of the princes of that name. I owe\nto this worthy lord all the happiness I ever knew.

The\ncardinal’s house had no secrets for me. I had often seen my noble\npatron annotating ancient volumes, and eagerly searching amongst dusty\nfamily manuscripts.

The slope was gradual, and the travelers had only to descend\na gentle declivity to the sea.\n\nWhen the Patagonian declined the horse that Glenarvan offered him, the\nlatter thought that he preferred to go on foot, according to the custom\nof certain guides; and indeed, his long legs ought to have made walking\neasy. But he was mistaken.\n\nAt the moment of departure Thalcave whistled in a peculiar manner.\nImmediately a magnificent Argentine horse, of superb form, issued from\na small wood near by, and approached at the call of his master. The\nanimal was perfectly beautiful. His brown color indicated a sound,\nspirited and courageous beast. He had a small and elegantly poised\nhead, widely opening nostrils, a fiery eye, large hams, swelling\nwithers, broad breast, long pasterns, in short, all the qualities that\nconstitute strength and suppleness. The major, like a perfect horseman,\nadmired unreservedly this specimen of the horses of the plains. This\nbeautiful creature was called Thaouka, which means \"bird\" in the\nPatagonian language, and he justly merited this appellation.\n\n[Sidenote: A FRESH START.]\n\nWhen Thalcave was in the saddle, the horse pranced with spirited grace,\nand the Patagonian, a skillful rider, was magnificent to behold. His\noutfit comprised two weapons of the chase, the \"bolas\" and the lasso.\nThe bolas consists of three balls tied together by a leathern string,\nwhich are fastened to the front of the saddle. The Indians frequently\nthrow them the distance of a hundred paces at the animal or enemy that\nthey are pursuing, and with such precision that they twist about their\nlegs and bring them to the ground. It is, therefore, in their hands a\nformidable instrument, and they handle it with surprising dexterity.\nThe lasso, on the contrary, does not leave the hand that wields it. It\nconsists simply of a leathern thong thirty feet in length, terminating\nin a slip-noose which works upon an iron ring. The right hand throws\nthe slip-noose, while the left hand holds the remainder of the lasso,\nthe end of which is firmly tied to the saddle. A long carbine in a\nsling completed the Patagonian's armament.\n\nThalcave, without observing the admiration caused by his natural\ngrace, ease and courage, took the lead, and the party advanced, now\nat a gallop, and now at a walk, for their horses seemed entirely\nunaccustomed to trotting. Robert mounted with much boldness, and\nspeedily convinced Glenarvan of his ability to keep his seat.\n\nOn issuing from the gorges of the Andes, they encountered a great\nnumber of sand-ridges, called \"medanos,\" real waves incessantly\nagitated by the wind, when the roots of the herbage did not confine\nthem to the earth. This sand is of an extreme fineness; and, at the\nleast breath, they saw it float away in light clouds, or form regular\nsand-columns which rose to a considerable height. This spectacle caused\npleasure as well as annoyance to the eyes. Pleasure, for nothing was\nmore curious than these columns, wandering over the plain, struggling,\nmingling, sinking and rising in inexpressible confusion; and annoyance,\nsince an impalpable dust emanated from these innumerable medanos and\npenetrated the eyelids, however tightly they were closed.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThis phenomenon continued during a great part of the day.

Two very rude palanquins, or\nrather litters, were brought to the foot of the mound. The corpses,\nfolded together, in a sitting posture, and tied in their clothes by a\ngirdle of withes, were placed on this primitive bier. Four warriors\nbore it between them, and the entire tribe, chanting the funeral hymn,\nfollowed them in procession to the place of burial.\n\nThe captives, who were always watched, saw them leave the inner\ninclosure of the pah, and then the songs and cries gradually died away.\nFor about half an hour this funeral escort continued in sight, in the\ndepths of the valley. Finally they perceived it again winding along\nthe mountain paths. The distance gave a fantastic appearance to the\nundulating movements of the long, sinuous column.\n\nThe tribe stopped at the summit of the mountain, which was eight\nhundred feet high, at the place prepared for Kara-Tété's interment.\nA common Maori would have had only a hole and a heap of stones for a\ngrave; but for a powerful and dreaded chief, destined doubtless for a\nspeedy deification, a tomb worthy of his exploits was reserved.\n\n[Sidenote: THE LAST NIGHT.]\n\nThe sepulchre had been surrounded by palisades, while stakes,\nornamented with faces reddened with ochre, stood beside the grave\nwhere the bodies were to lie. The relatives had not forgotten that the\n\"waidoua\" (the spirit of the dead) feeds on substantial nourishment\nlike the body during this perishable life. Food had therefore been\ndeposited in the inclosure, together with the weapons and clothes of\nthe deceased.\n\nNothing was wanting for the comfort of the tomb. Husband and wife were\nlaid side by side, and then covered with earth and grass after a series\nof renewed lamentations. Then the procession silently descended the\nmountain, and now no one could ascend it under penalty of death, for it\nwas tabooed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LI.\n\nSTRANGELY LIBERATED.\n\n\nJust as the sun was disappearing behind Lake Taupo, the captives were\nled back to their prison. They were not to leave it again until the\nsummit of the Wahiti mountains should kindle with the first beams of\nthe day. One night remained to prepare for death. In spite of the\nfaintness, in spite of the horror with which they were seized, they\nshared their repast in common.\n\n\"We shall need all the strength possible to face death,\" said\nGlenarvan. \"We must show these barbarians how Europeans and Christians\ncan die.\"\n\nThe meal being finished, Lady Helena repeated the evening prayer aloud,\nwhile all her companions, with uncovered heads, joined her. Having\nfulfilled this duty, and enjoyed this privilege, the prisoners embraced\neach other. Lady Helena and Mary Grant then retired to one corner of\nthe hut, and stretched themselves upon a mat. Sleep, which soothes all\nwoes, soon closed their eyes, and they slumbered in each other's arms,\novercome by fatigue and long wakefulness.\n\nGlenarvan, taking his friends aside, said:\n\n\"My dear companions, our lives and those of these poor ladies are in\nGod's hands.

It was a notice\nof the colonial police, detailing the escape of the convicts from\nPerth, and setting a price upon the head of Ben Joyce--a hundred pounds\nsterling to any one who should deliver him up.\n\n\"Indeed,\" said Glenarvan, \"that is a rascal worth hanging.\"\n\n\"And especially worth taking,\" replied Ayrton. \"A hundred pounds! What\na sum!

Here they\nbegan the ascent.\n\n[Sidenote: ANOTHER DEATH.]\n\nBut it was an arduous task. More than once the ladies and their\ncompanions had to dismount, and it was often necessary to push the\nwheels of the heavy vehicle at some steep ascent, or to hold it\nback along the edge of some dangerous precipice. The oxen, as they\ncould not work to advantage at sudden turns, had frequently to be\nunyoked, and the cart blocked to prevent it from sliding back. Ayrton\nwas repeatedly forced to bring the already exhausted horses to his\nassistance.\n\nWhether this exertion was too prolonged, or whether from some other\ncause, one of the horses gave out during the ascent. He fell suddenly,\nwithout an instant's warning. It was Mulready's horse; and when the\nsailor attempted to help him up, he found that he was dead. Ayrton\nexamined the animal carefully, but did not seem to understand the cause\nof this sudden death.\n\n\"The beast must have burst a blood-vessel,\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\"Evidently,\" replied Ayrton.\n\n\"Take my horse, Mulready,\" added Glenarvan; \"I will join Lady Helena in\nthe cart.\"\n\nMulready obeyed, and the little party continued their fatiguing ascent,\nabandoning the body to the crows.\n\nThe next day they began the descent, which was much more rapid. During\nits course a violent hail-storm burst on them, and they were forced to\nseek a shelter beneath the rocks. Not hailstones, but pieces of ice as\nlarge as one's hand, were precipitated from the angry clouds. A sling\ncould not have hurled them with greater force, and several sharp blows\nwarned Paganel and Robert to be on their guard. The cart was pierced\nthrough in many places: indeed, few roofs could have resisted the fall\nof these cutting missiles, some of which froze to the trunks of the\ntrees. It was necessary to wait for the end of this avalanche, for fear\nof being stoned to death, and it was an hour before the party regained\nthe steep path, still slippery with icy incrustations. At evening the\ncart, considerably shattered, but still firm on its wooden wheels,\ndescended the last slopes of the Alps, between tall solitary pines, and\nreached the plains of Gippsland.\n\n[Illustration: Not hailstones, but pieces of ice as large as one's\nhand, were precipitated from the angry clouds.]\n\n[Sidenote: DIVIDED COUNSELS.]\n\nAll were impatient to gain their destination, the Pacific Ocean,\nwhere the Britannia had been wrecked.

He took nothing away, for he was willing that the guilty convict\nshould inherit his possessions.\n\nThey returned to the vessel; and, as he expected to sail the same day,\nGlenarvan gave orders for the quartermaster's landing. Ayrton was\nbrought on deck, and found himself in the presence of Harry Grant.\n\n\"It is I, Ayrton,\" said he.\n\n\"Yes, captain,\" replied Ayrton, without betraying any astonishment at\nHarry Grant's appearance. \"Well, I am not sorry to see you again in\ngood health.\"\n\n[Illustration: The passengers could see the quartermaster, with folded\narms, standing motionless as a statue, on a rock, and gazing at the\nvessel.]\n\n\"It seems, Ayrton, that I made a mistake in landing you on an inhabited\ncoast.\"\n\n\"It seems so, captain.\"\n\n\"You will take my place on this desert island.

His intelligent countenance became\nsuffused with a peaceful emotion.\n\nBut Paganel had not finished his inquiries. Where was this prisoner?\nWhat was he doing? When had Thalcave heard of him? All these questions\nthronged his mind at once. He did not have to wait long for answers,\nbut learnt that the European was a slave of one of the Indian tribes\nthat scour the plains.\n\n\"But where was he last?\" asked Paganel.\n\n\"With the cazique Calfoucoura,\" answered Thalcave.\n\n\"On the line we have been following?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And who is this cazique?\"\n\n\"The chief of the Poyuches Indians; a man with two tongues and two\nhearts.\"\n\n[Sidenote: A SCIENTIFIC BATH.]\n\n\"That is to say, false in word and in deed,\" said Paganel, after\ntranslating to his companions this beautiful metaphor of the Indian\nlanguage. \"And can we rescue our friend?\" he added.\n\n\"Perhaps so, if your friend is still in the hands of the Indians.\"\n\n\"And when did you hear of him?\"\n\n\"A long time ago, and, since then, the sun has brought back two summers\nto the sky.\"\n\nGlenarvan's joy could not be described.

Their chief, after an obstinate resistance, in which he lost\nhis principal warriors, was now on his way to rouse again the river\ntribes.

It was the only way of\ninfluencing those fierce natures.\n\n[Illustration: A boat might have been seen ascending the Waikato.

However, from a few words exchanged,\nGlenarvan perceived that they were acquainted with the English\nlanguage. He therefore resolved to question the chief in regard to the\nfate that was in store for them. Addressing Kai-Koumou, he said, in a\nfearless tone:\n\n\"Where are you taking us, chief?\"\n\nKai-Koumou gazed at him coldly without answering.\n\n\"Say, what do you expect to do with us?\" continued Glenarvan.\n\nThe chief's eyes blazed with a sudden light, and in a stern voice he\nreplied:\n\n\"To exchange you, if your friends will ransom you; to kill you, if they\nrefuse.\"\n\nGlenarvan asked no more, but hope returned to his heart.

Only a\ngood sleep could thoroughly refresh, after this eventful day. The\ninmates of the tree felt themselves not only fatigued by the sudden\nchanges of the inundation, but especially overcome by the heat, which\nhad been excessive. Their feathered companions had already set the\nexample; the hilgueros, those nightingales of the Pampas, had ceased\ntheir melodious warblings, and all the birds had disappeared in the\nrecesses of the foliage. The best plan was to imitate them.\n\nBut before \"retiring to their nest,\" as Paganel said, Glenarvan,\nRobert, and he climbed to the observatory, to examine for the last\ntime the watery expanse. It was about nine o'clock. The sun had just\nset in the sparkling mists of the horizon, and all the western part\nof the firmament was bathed in a warm vapor. The constellations,\nusually so dazzling, seemed veiled in a soft haze.

Not a leaf stirred on the tree, not a ripple curled\nthe surface of the waters. Even the air seemed to fail, as if some\nhuge pneumatic machine had rarefied it.

If Captain Grant was a\nprisoner of one of these tribes, had he been carried to the north or\nto the south? This problem harassed Glenarvan.

As they drew near to the streets of\nthis hastily-built town, Ayrton and Mulready, who were in charge of the\ncart, were sent forward, whilst the others walked through the place to\ninspect what there might be of interest, as well as to ascertain what\nmight be learned concerning the object of their expedition.\n\nThus, in this strange gathering of all nationalities and creeds and\nprofessions, the regular inhabitants beheld a still more extraordinary\nsight than that every day afforded them: folks who to the refinement\nwhich education and civilization give added both the earnestness\nof the worker and the freshness and vigor of the pleasure-seeking\ntourist. In the streets, in connection with the strange sign-boards and\nannouncements, the novel erections and purposes to which some of them\nwere adapted, Paganel had a history and commentary for every one.\n\nStill more did he expatiate upon the thousand-and-one topics of\ninterest when they visited the bank building, which here is the\ncentre of more than one agency connected with this great gold-bearing\ndistrict.

Lady\nHelena and Mary Grant turned away their eyes with more of disgust than\nterror. These heads had most of them belonged to hostile chiefs, fallen\nin battle, whose bodies had served as food for the conquerors. The\ngeographer knew them to be such by their hollow and eyeless sockets!\n\nIn Kai-Koumou's pah only the heads of his enemies formed this frightful\nmuseum; and here, doubtless, more than one English skull had served to\nincrease the size of the chief's collection.\n\nHis hut, among those belonging to warriors of lower rank, stood at the\nrear of the pah, in front of a large open terrace. This structure was\nbuilt of stakes, interlaced with branches, and lined inside with flax\nmatting.\n\nOnly one opening gave access to the dwelling. A thick curtain, made\nof a vegetable tissue, served as a door. The roof projected so as to\nform a water-shed.

Farther off, in small pens, pigs and goats were\nconfined, and dogs ran about seeking their scanty sustenance. They were\nrather poorly kept, for animals that formed the Maori daily food.\n\nGlenarvan and his companions had taken in the whole at a glance. They\nawaited beside an empty hut the good pleasure of the chief, exposed to\nthe insults of a crowd of old women, who surrounded them like harpies,\nand threatened them with their fists, crying and howling. Several\nEnglish words that passed their lips clearly indicated that they were\ndemanding immediate vengeance.\n\nIn the midst of these cries and threats, Lady Helena affected a\ncalmness that she could not feel in her heart. This courageous woman,\nin order that her husband's coolness might not forsake him, heroically\ncontrolled her emotions. Poor Mary Grant felt herself growing weak, and\nCaptain Mangles supported her, ready to die in her defence. The others\nendured this torrent of invectives in various ways, either indifferent\nlike the major, or increasingly annoyed like Paganel.\n\nGlenarvan, wishing to relieve Lady Helena from the assaults of these\nshrews, boldly approached Kai-Koumou, and, pointing to the hideous\nthrong, said:\n\n\"Drive them away!\"\n\nThe Maori chief gazed steadily at his prisoner without replying.

About midnight,\nthe travelers, surprised in their sleep, were made prisoners and\ncarried on board the canoe. They had not yet been maltreated, but had\ntried in vain to resist. Their arms and ammunition were in the hands of\nthe savages, and their own bullets would have quickly stretched them on\nthe earth had they attempted to escape.\n\nThey were not long in learning, by the aid of a few English words which\nthe natives used, that, being driven back by the British troops, they\nwere returning, vanquished and weakened, to the regions of the upper\nWaikato. Their chief, after an obstinate resistance, in which he lost\nhis principal warriors, was now on his way to rouse again the river\ntribes.

No pity could be\nexpected from him.

Yet, looking at his calm and\npassionless countenance, you could not have divined the depth of his\nanguish, for in his present critical situation he did not betray the\nextent of his misfortunes. He felt that he ought to set an example of\nfortitude to his wife and his companions, as being the husband and\nchief. Moreover, he was ready to die first for the common safety, if\ncircumstances should require it.\n\n[Sidenote: CHIEFS, CIVILIZED AND UNCIVILIZED.]\n\nHis companions were worthy of him; they shared his noble thoughts, and\ntheir calm and haughty appearance would scarcely have intimated that\nthey were being carried away to captivity and suffering. By common\nconsent, at Glenarvan's suggestion, they had resolved to feign a proud\nindifference in the presence of the savages. It was the only way of\ninfluencing those fierce natures.\n\n[Illustration: A boat might have been seen ascending the Waikato. It\nwas a canoe seventy feet long and five broad.]\n\nSince leaving the encampment, the natives, taciturn like all savages,\nhad scarcely spoken to each other. However, from a few words exchanged,\nGlenarvan perceived that they were acquainted with the English\nlanguage. He therefore resolved to question the chief in regard to the\nfate that was in store for them. Addressing Kai-Koumou, he said, in a\nfearless tone:\n\n\"Where are you taking us, chief?\"\n\nKai-Koumou gazed at him coldly without answering.\n\n\"Say, what do you expect to do with us?\" continued Glenarvan.\n\nThe chief's eyes blazed with a sudden light, and in a stern voice he\nreplied:\n\n\"To exchange you, if your friends will ransom you; to kill you, if they\nrefuse.\"\n\nGlenarvan asked no more, but hope returned to his heart. Doubtless,\nsome chiefs of the Maori tribe had fallen into the hands of the\nEnglish, and the natives would attempt to recover them by way of\nexchange; their situation, therefore, was not one for despair.\n\nMeantime the canoe rapidly ascended the river.

Now,\nthen, were a conspirator to fall into your hands, he would be most\nwelcome.”\n\n“For my part, dear mother,” interposed Renée, “I trust your wishes will\nnot prosper, and that Providence will only permit petty offenders, poor\ndebtors, and miserable cheats to fall into M. de Villefort’s\nhands,—then I shall be contented.”\n\n“Just the same as though you prayed that a physician might only be\ncalled upon to prescribe for headaches, measles, and the stings of\nwasps, or any other slight affection of the epidermis. If you wish to\nsee me the king’s attorney, you must desire for me some of those\nviolent and dangerous diseases from the cure of which so much honor\nredounds to the physician.”\n\nAt this moment, and as though the utterance of Villefort’s wish had\nsufficed to effect its accomplishment, a servant entered the room, and\nwhispered a few words in his ear. Villefort immediately rose from table\nand quitted the room upon the plea of urgent business; he soon,\nhowever, returned, his whole face beaming with delight. Renée regarded\nhim with fond affection; and certainly his handsome features, lit up as\nthey then were with more than usual fire and animation, seemed formed\nto excite the innocent admiration with which she gazed on her graceful\nand intelligent lover.\n\n“You were wishing just now,” said Villefort, addressing her, “that I\nwere a doctor instead of a lawyer. Well, I at least resemble the\ndisciples of Esculapius in one thing [people spoke in this style in\n1815], that of not being able to call a day my own, not even that of my\nbetrothal.”\n\n“And wherefore were you called away just now?” asked Mademoiselle de\nSaint-Méran, with an air of deep interest.\n\n“For a very serious matter, which bids fair to make work for the\nexecutioner.”\n\n“How dreadful!” exclaimed Renée, turning pale.\n\n“Is it possible?” burst simultaneously from all who were near enough to\nthe magistrate to hear his words.\n\n“Why, if my information prove correct, a sort of Bonapartist conspiracy\nhas just been discovered.”\n\n“Can I believe my ears?” cried the marquise.\n\n“I will read you the letter containing the accusation, at least,” said\nVillefort:\n\n“‘The king’s attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and the\nreligious institutions of his country, that one named Edmond Dantès,\nmate of the ship _Pharaon_, this day arrived from Smyrna, after having\ntouched at Naples and Porto-Ferrajo, has been the bearer of a letter\nfrom Mur", "label": "CONTRADICT"}

Several cracks and a few gusts\nof hot smoke warned them that their position was becoming dangerous.\nBut a final effort detached the block, which glided down the slope of\nthe mountain and disappeared.\n\nThe thin covering at once yielded. An incandescent column poured forth\ntowards the sky with loud explosions, while streams of boiling water\nand lava rolled towards the encampment of the natives and the valleys\nbelow. The whole peak trembled, and you might almost have thought that\nit was disappearing in a general conflagration.\n\nGlenarvan and his companions had scarcely time to escape the shock of\nthe eruption. They fled to the inclosure of the tomb, but not without\nreceiving a few scalding drops of the water, which bubbled and exhaled\na strong sulphureous odor.\n\nThen mud, lava, and volcanic fragments mingled in the scene of\ndevastation. Torrents of flame furrowed the sides of the Maunganamu.\nThe adjoining mountains glowed in the light of the eruption, and the\ndeep valleys were illumined with a vivid brightness.\n\nThe savages were soon aroused, both by the noise and the heat\nof the lava that flowed in a scalding tide through the midst of\ntheir encampment.

It was no longer a simple geyser. All this\nvolcanic effervescence had hitherto been confined beneath the crust of\nthe peak, since the outlets of Tangariro sufficed for its expansion;\nbut as a new opening had been made, it had rushed forth with extreme\nviolence.\n\nAll night long, during the storm that raged above and below, the peak\nwas shaken with a commotion that could not but alarm Glenarvan. The\nprisoners, concealed behind the palisade of the tomb, watched the\nfearful progress of the outbreak.\n\nMorning came. The fury of the volcano had not moderated. Thick,\nyellowish vapors mingled with the flames, and torrents of lava poured\nin every direction. Glenarvan, with eye alert and beating heart,\nglanced between the interstices of the inclosure, and surveyed the camp\nof the Maoris.\n\nThe natives had fled to the neighboring plateaus, beyond the reach of\nthe volcano. Several corpses, lying at the foot of the peak, had been\ncharred by the fire. Farther on, towards the pah, the lava had consumed\na number of huts, that were still smoking. The savages, in scattered\ngroups, were gazing at the vapory summit of Maunganamu with religious\nawe.\n\nKai-Koumou came into the midst of his warriors, and Glenarvan\nrecognized him. The chief advanced to the base of the peak, on the side\nspared by the eruption, but did not cross the first slopes. Here, with\noutstretched arms, like a sorcerer exorcising, he made a few grimaces,\nthe meaning of which did not escape the prisoners.

He, no doubt, thought that prisoners who died in the Château\nd’If were interred in an ordinary burial-ground, and he conveyed the\ndead man into his own cell, took his place in the sack in which they\nhad sewed up the corpse, and awaited the moment of interment.”\n\n“It was a bold step, and one that showed some courage,” remarked the\nEnglishman.\n\n“As I have already told you, sir, he was a very dangerous man; and,\nfortunately, by his own act disembarrassed the government of the fears\nit had on his account.”\n\n“How was that?”\n\n“How?

He did not,\nhowever, notice one peculiarity observed by Glenarvan, and that was the\nyoung captain's attentions to his neighbor, Mary Grant. A slight sign\nfrom Lady Helena to her husband told him how matters stood. He gazed at\nthe two young people with affectionate sympathy, and finally addressed\nthe captain, but upon a different subject.\n\n\"How did you succeed with your voyage, captain?\" he inquired.\n\n\"Excellently,\" replied the captain; \"only I must inform your lordship\nthat we did not return by way of the Strait of Magellan.\"\n\n\"What!\" cried Paganel, \"you doubled Cape Horn, and I was not there!\"\n\n\"Hang yourself!\" said the major.\n\n\"Selfish fellow! you give me this advice in order that you may share my\nrope!\" retorted the geographer.\n\n\"Well, my dear Paganel,\" added Glenarvan, \"unless we are endowed with\nubiquity, we cannot be everywhere.

He told, word\nfor word, all about their journey from ocean to ocean. The passage\nof the Andes, the earthquake, Robert's disappearance, his capture by\nthe condor, Thalcave's fortunate shot, the adventure with the wolves,\nthe boy's devotion, the meeting with Sergeant Manuel, the inundation,\ntheir refuge in the tree, the lightning, the fire, the alligators,\nthe water-spout, the night on the shores of the Atlantic, all these\nincidents, cheerful or serious, excited alternately the joy and terror\nof his hearers. Many a circumstance was related that brought Robert\nthe caresses of his sister and Lady Helena. Never was boy more highly\npraised, or by more enthusiastic friends.\n\n\"Now, my friends,\" remarked Lord Glenarvan, when he had finished his\nrecital, \"let us think of the present. Let us return to the subject of\nCaptain Grant.\"\n\nWhen breakfast was over, the party repaired to Lady Helena's\nstate-room, and, taking seats around a table loaded with maps and\ncharts, resumed the conversation. Glenarvan explained that the\nshipwreck had not taken place on the shores either of the Pacific or\nthe Atlantic, and that, consequently, the document had been wrongly\ninterpreted so far as Patagonia was concerned; that Paganel, by a\nsudden inspiration, had discovered the mistake and proved that they had\nbeen following a false trail. The geographer was accordingly asked to\nexplain the French document, which he did to the satisfaction of every\none.

General Quesnel, it appears, had just\nleft a Bonapartist club when he disappeared. An unknown person had been\nwith him that morning, and made an appointment with him in the Rue\nSaint-Jacques; unfortunately, the general’s valet, who was dressing his\nhair at the moment when the stranger entered, heard the street\nmentioned, but did not catch the number.” As the police minister\nrelated this to the king, Villefort, who looked as if his very life\nhung on the speaker’s lips, turned alternately red and pale. The king\nlooked towards him.\n\n“Do you not think with me, M. de Villefort, that General Quesnel, whom\nthey believed attached to the usurper, but who was really entirely\ndevoted to me, has perished the victim of a Bonapartist ambush?”\n\n“It is probable, sire,” replied Villefort. “But is this all that is\nknown?”\n\n“They are on the track of the man who appointed the meeting with him.”\n\n“On his track?” said Villefort.\n\n“Yes, the servant has given his description. He is a man of from fifty\nto fifty-two years of age, dark, with black eyes covered with shaggy\neyebrows, and a thick moustache.

The major was a man of fifty, of calm,\nregular features, who did as he was bid; of an excellent and superior\ncharacter, modest, taciturn, peaceable, and mild; always agreeing\nwith anything or any one, disputing nothing, and neither contradicting\nhimself nor exaggerating. He would mount with measured step the\nstaircase to his bed-chamber, even were a cannon-ball behind him; and\nprobably to his dying day would never find an opportunity to fly into a\npassion.\n\nThis man possessed, in a high degree, not only the common courage of\nthe battle-field (that physical bravery due only to nervous strength),\nbut, better still, moral courage, that is to say, firmness of soul. If\nhe had a fault, it was that of being absolutely Scotch from head to\nfoot, a pure-blooded Caledonian, an infatuated observer of the ancient\ncustoms of his country. Through his relationship to the Glenarvans he\nlived at Malcolm Castle; and as major and military man it was very\nnatural that he should be found on board the Duncan.\n\nSuch, then, were the passengers of this yacht, summoned by unforeseen\ncircumstances to accomplish one of the most surprising voyages of\nmodern times. Since her arrival at the wharf at Glasgow, she had\nmonopolized the public attention. A considerable number came every day\nto visit her. They were interested in her alone, and spoke only of her,\nto the great umbrage of the other captains of the port, among others\nCaptain Burton, commanding the Scotia, a magnificent steamer, moored\nbeside the Duncan, and bound for Calcutta. The Scotia, from her size,\nhad a right to consider the Duncan as a mere fly-boat. Nevertheless,\nall the attraction centred in Lord Glenarvan's yacht, and increased\nfrom day to day.\n\nThe time of departure approached. Captain Mangles had shown himself\nskillful and expeditious. A month after her trial trip in the Frith of\nClyde, the Duncan, laden, provisioned, and equipped, was ready to put\nto sea. The 25th of August was appointed for the time of departure,\nwhich would enable the yacht to reach the southern latitudes by the\nbeginning of spring. Lord Glenarvan, when his plan was matured, did\nnot neglect to make investigations into the hardships and perils of the\nvoyage; yet he did not hesitate on this account, but prepared to leave\nMalcolm Castle.\n\nOn the 24th of August, Lord and Lady Glenarvan, Major MacNabb, Mary and\nRobert Grant, Mr. Olbinett, the steward of the yacht, and his wife, who\nwas in the service of Lady Glenarvan, left the castle, after taking an\naffectionate farewell of their family servants. Several hours afterward\nthey found themselves on board. Many of the population of Glasgow\nwelcomed with sympathetic admiration the young and courageous lady who\nrenounced the pleasures of a life of luxury, and sailed to the rescue\nof the shipwrecked sailors.\n\nThe apartments of Lord Glenarvan and his wife occupied the entire stern\nof the vessel. They consisted of two bed-chambers, a parlor, and two\ndressing-rooms, adjoining which was an open square inclosed by six\ncabins, five of which were occupied by Mary and Robert Grant, Mr. and\nMrs. Olbinett, and Major MacNabb. As for the cabins of the captain and\nthe mate, they were situated in the forecastle, and opened on the deck.\nThe crew were lodged between-decks very comfortably, for the yacht of\ncourse carried nothing but her coal, provisions, and armament.\n\nThe Duncan was to start on the night of the 24th, as the tide fell at\nthree o'clock in the morning.

Only, during the respite the\nabsence of his rival afforded him, he reflected, partly on the means of\ndeceiving Mercédès as to the cause of his absence, partly on plans of\nemigration and abduction, as from time to time he sat sad and\nmotionless on the summit of Cape Pharo, at the spot from whence\nMarseilles and the Catalans are visible, watching for the apparition of\na young and handsome man, who was for him also the messenger of\nvengeance. Fernand’s mind was made up; he would shoot Dantès, and then\nkill himself. But Fernand was mistaken; a man of his disposition never\nkills himself, for he constantly hopes.\n\nDuring this time the empire made its last conscription, and every man\nin France capable of bearing arms rushed to obey the summons of the\nemperor. Fernand departed with the rest, bearing with him the terrible\nthought that while he was away, his rival would perhaps return and\nmarry Mercédès. Had Fernand really meant to kill himself, he would have\ndone so when he parted from Mercédès. His devotion, and the compassion\nhe showed for her misfortunes, produced the effect they always produce\non noble minds—Mercédès had always had a sincere regard for Fernand,\nand this was now strengthened by gratitude.\n\n“My brother,” said she, as she placed his knapsack on his shoulders,\n“be careful of yourself, for if you are killed, I shall be alone in the\nworld.” These words carried a ray of hope into Fernand’s heart. Should\nDantès not return, Mercédès might one day be his.\n\n0165m\n\n\n\nMercédès was left alone face to face with the vast plain that had never\nseemed so barren, and the sea that had never seemed so vast. Bathed in\ntears she wandered about the Catalan village. Sometimes she stood mute\nand motionless as a statue, looking towards Marseilles, at other times\ngazing on the sea, and debating as to whether it were not better to\ncast herself into the abyss of the ocean, and thus end her woes. It was\nnot want of courage that prevented her putting this resolution into\nexecution; but her religious feelings came to her aid and saved her.\n\nCaderousse was, like Fernand, enrolled in the army, but, being married\nand eight years older, he was merely sent to the frontier. Old Dantès,\nwho was only sustained by hope, lost all hope at Napoleon’s downfall.\nFive months after he had been separated from his son, and almost at the\nhour of his arrest, he breathed his last in Mercédès’ arms. M. Morrel\npaid the expenses of his funeral, and a few small debts the poor old\nman had contracted.\n\nThere was more than benevolence in this action; there was courage; the\nsouth was aflame, and to assist, even on his death-bed, the father of\nso dangerous a Bonapartist as Dantès, was stigmatized as a crime.\n\n\n\n Chapter 14.

Ayrton\nurged Lord Glenarvan to send an order to the Duncan to repair to the\ncoast, that he might have at his disposal all the aid possible in his\nsearch. In his opinion they ought to take advantage of the Lucknow\nroad, which would lead them to Melbourne. Afterwards this might be\ndifficult, for highways leading directly to the capital would be\nabsolutely wanting.\n\nThis advice of the quartermaster seemed reasonable. Paganel seconded\nit. He thought, too, that the yacht would be very useful under the\npresent circumstances, and added that they could no longer communicate\nwith Melbourne after passing the Lucknow road.\n\nGlenarvan was undecided, and perhaps would have sent the order that\nAyrton so particularly desired, if the major had not opposed this plan\nwith great energy. He explained that Ayrton's presence was necessary\nto the expedition; that on approaching the coast the country would be\nunknown; that, if chance set them on the track of Captain Grant, the\nquartermaster would be more capable than any one else of following it;\nin short, that he alone could point out the place where the Britannia\nwas lost.\n\nMacNabb, therefore, advocated their continuing on the journey without\nchange. Captain Mangles was of the same opinion. The young captain\nobserved that his lordship's orders could more easily reach the Duncan\nif sent from Twofold Bay, than by dispatching a messenger two hundred\nmiles over a wild country.\n\nThe major carried his point, and it was therefore decided that they\nshould proceed to Twofold Bay. MacNabb noticed that Ayrton seemed quite\ndisappointed, but he said nothing, and, according to his custom, kept\nhis thoughts to himself.\n\nEarly in the afternoon they passed through a curious forest of ferns.\nThese arborescent plants, in full bloom, measured thirty feet in\nheight. Horses and horsemen could easily pass beneath their drooping\nbranches, and sometimes the rowel of a spur would ring, as it struck\nagainst their solid stalks. The coolness of the grove was very grateful\nto the wearied travelers. Paganel, always demonstrative, gave vent to\nexclamations of delight that startled flocks of parrots and cockatoos.\n\nAll at once his companions saw the geographer reel in the saddle, and\nfall to the ground like a log. Was it giddiness, or sunstroke, caused\nby the heat?\n\nThey hastened to him.\n\n\"Paganel! Paganel! what is the matter?\" cried Lord Glenarvan.\n\n\"The matter is, my dear friend,\" replied Paganel, extricating himself\nfrom the stirrups, \"that I no longer have a horse.\"\n\n\"What! your horse----?\"\n\n\"Is dead, stricken like Mulready's.\"\n\nAt once Glenarvan, Captain Mangles, and Wilson examined the animal.\nPaganel was right. His horse had been suddenly stricken dead.\n\n\"This is singular,\" said the captain.\n\n\"Very singular indeed,\" muttered the major.\n\nGlenarvan could not restrain a feeling of uneasiness at this strange\noccurrence. It was impossible for them to retrace their steps in this\ndesert; while, if an epidemic were to seize all the horses, it would be\nvery difficult to continue the journey.\n\nBefore the end of the day his fears seemed to be justified. A third\nhorse, Wilson's, fell dead, and, what was worse, one of the oxen was\nalso stricken. Their means of conveyance now consisted of only three\noxen and four horses.\n\n[Sidenote: A FINE FERNERY.]\n\nThe situation had grown serious. The mounted horsemen could, of course,\ntake turns in traveling on foot. But, if it should be necessary to\nleave the cart behind, what would become of the ladies? Could they\naccomplish the one hundred and twenty miles that still separated them\nfrom Twofold Bay?\n\nCaptain Mangles and Glenarvan anxiously examined the remaining horses:\nperhaps preventives might be found against new calamities. No sign\nof disease, however, could be detected. The animals were in perfect\nhealth, and bravely endured the hardships of the journey.

Welcome, welcome! I am almost a\nFrenchman,\" cried the commander, shaking the geographer's arm with\nrather painful violence.]\n\n[Sidenote: RAISING A REGIMENT.]\n\nHe then entered into conversation with the commander. Glenarvan would\ngladly have put in a word in regard to his affairs, but the soldier\nwas telling his story, and was not in the mood to be interrupted.\nThis honest man had left France a long time before; and the native\nlanguage was no longer perfectly familiar to him: he had forgotten,\nif not words, at least the manner of combining them. As his visitors\nsoon learned, he had been a sergeant in the French army. Since the\nfoundation of the fort he had not left it, and commanded it by\nappointment from the Argentine government. He was by parentage a\nBasque, and his name was Manuel Ipharaguerre. A year after his arrival\nin the country, Sergeant Manuel was naturalized, joined the Argentine\narmy, and married an honest Indian woman, who had twins,--boys, to be\nsure, for the sergeant's worthy consort would never present him with\ndaughters. Manuel did not think of any other calling than that of the\nsoldier, and hoped, in time, with the help of God, to offer to the\nrepublic a whole battalion of young soldiers.\n\n\"You have seen them?\" said he. \"Charming fellows! Good soldiers! José!\nJuan! Miguel! Pepe! Pepe is only seven years old, and is already biting\nhis cartridge!\"\n\nPepe, hearing himself complimented, joined his two little feet, and\npresented arms with perfect precision.\n\n\"He will do!\" added the sergeant. \"He will be a major--or\nbrigadier-general one day!\"\n\nThis story lasted a quarter of an hour, to Thalcave's great\nastonishment. The Indian could not understand how so many words could\ncome from a single throat. No one interrupted the commander; and even\na French sergeant had to conclude at last, though not without forcing\nhis guests to accompany him to his dwelling. Here they were introduced\nto Madame Ipharaguerre, who appeared to be \"a good-looking person,\" if\nthis expression may be employed in regard to an Indian.\n\nWhen he had exhausted himself, the sergeant asked his guests to what he\nowed the honor of their visit. And now it was their turn to explain.\n\nPaganel, opening the conversation in French, told him of their journey\nacross the Pampas, and ended by asking why the Indians had abandoned\nthe country.\n\n\"War!\" replied the sergeant.\n\n\"War?\"\n\n\"Yes, civil war.\"\n\n\"Civil war?\" rejoined Paganel.\n\n\"Yes, war between Paraguay and Buenos Ayres,\" answered the sergeant.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Why, all the Indians of the north are in the rear of General Flores,\nand those of the plains are plundering.\"\n\n\"But the caziques?\"\n\n\"The caziques with them.\"\n\nThis answer was reported to Thalcave, who shook his head. Indeed,\nhe either did not know, or had forgotten, that a civil war, which\nwas afterwards to involve Brazil, was decimating two-thirds of the\nrepublic. The Indians had everything to gain in these internal\nstruggles, and could not neglect such fine opportunities for plunder.\nThe sergeant, therefore, was not mistaken in attributing this desertion\nof the Pampas to the civil war that was being waged in the northern\npart of the Argentine Provinces.\n\nBut this event disconcerted Glenarvan's hopes. If Captain Grant was\na prisoner of the caziques, he must have been carried by them to the\nnorthern frontiers. Yet how and where to find him? Must they attempt\na perilous and almost useless search to the northern limits of the\nPampas? It was a serious matter, which was to be earnestly considered.\n\nHowever, one important question was still to be asked of the sergeant,\nand the major thought of this, while his companions were looking at\neach other in silence.\n\n\"Hav", "label": "NEUTRAL"}

The three\nhorses galloped briskly forward. These excellent beasts perceived,\ndoubtless, by instinct, whither their masters were guiding them.\nThaouka, especially, showed a spirit that neither fatigue nor thirst\ncould overcome.

It was soon evident, however, that, with the\nexception of Thaouka, the horses could not long maintain this speed. At\nnoon it was necessary to give them an hour's rest.\n\nGlenarvan grew uneasy. The signs of dryness did not diminish, and the\nwant of water might result in disastrous consequences. Thalcave said\nnothing, but probably thought that if the Guamini was dry it would then\nbe time to despair, if indeed an Indian's heart has ever experienced\nsuch an emotion.\n\nThey therefore kept on, and by use of whip and spur the horses were\ninduced to continue their journey, but they could not quicken their\npace.

It was not, however, without much\nresistance, prancing and neighing, that Thalcave's horse consented to\nkeep pace with the others. It was not so much the strength as the voice\nof his master which restrained him; the Indian actually talked to his\nhorse; and the animal, if he did not answer, at least comprehended\nhim.

They came before the chief, who did not delay\nsentence.\n\n\"You killed Kara-Tété!\" said he to Glenarvan.\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n[Sidenote: THE BEGINNING OF THE END.]\n\n\"You shall die to-morrow at sunrise.\"\n\n\"Alone?\" inquired Glenarvan, whose heart beat quickly.\n\n\"What! as if our Tohonga's life were not more precious than yours!\"\ncried Kai-Koumou, whose eyes expressed a fierce regret.\n\nAt this moment a commotion took place among the natives. Glenarvan cast\na rapid glance around him. The crowd opened, and a warrior, dripping\nwith sweat and overcome with fatigue, appeared.\n\nAs soon as Kai-Koumou perceived him, he said in English, evidently that\nhe might be understood by the captives:\n\n\"You come from the camp of the pale-faces?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the Maori.\n\n\"You saw the prisoner, our Tohonga?\"\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n\"Is he living?\"\n\n\"He is dead! The English have shot him.\"\n\nThe fate of Glenarvan and his companions was settled.\n\n\"You shall all die to-morrow at daybreak!\" cried Kai-Koumou.\n\nThe unfortunates were therefore to suffer a common death. Lady Helena\nand Mary Grant raised towards heaven a look of thankfulness.\n\nThe captives were not taken back to the temple. They were to attend\nthat day the funeral of the dead chief, and the bloody ceremonies\nconnected therewith. A party of natives conducted them to the foot of\nan enormous koudi, where these guardians remained without losing sight\nof their prisoners. The rest of the tribe, absorbed in their official\nmourning, seemed to have forgotten them.\n\nThe customary three days had elapsed since the death of Kara-Tété. The\nsoul of the deceased had therefore forever abandoned its mortal abode.\nThe sacred rites began.\n\nThe body was carried to a small mound in the centre of the\nfortification, clothed in splendid costume, and enveloped in a\nmagnificent flaxen mat. The head was adorned with plumes, and wore a\ncrown of green leaves. The face, arms, and breast had been rubbed with\noil, and therefore showed no mortification.\n\nThe parents and friends of the deceased came to the foot of the\nmound, and all at once, as if some director were beating time to a\nfuneral dirge, a great concert of cries, groans, and sobs arose on the\nair. They mourned the dead in plaintive and modulated cadences. His\nrelations struck their heads together; his kinswomen lacerated their\nfaces with their nails, and showed themselves more lavish of blood than\nof tears.

There we must\nsearch, and, by taking different ways, we shall find him.\"\n\nNot a word more was said. The six men, scaling the declivities of the\nmountain, stationed themselves at different heights along the ridge,\nand began their search. They kept always to the right of their line of\ndescent, sounding the smallest fissures, descending to the bottom of\nprecipices half filled with fragments of the mass; and more than one\ncame forth with his garments in shreds, his feet and hands lacerated,\nat the peril of his life.\n\n[Sidenote: A SLEEPLESS NIGHT.]\n\nAll this portion of the Andes, except a few inaccessible plateaus,\nwas carefully explored for many hours without one of these brave men\nthinking of rest. But it was a vain search. The child had not only\nfound death in the mountains, but also a tomb, the stone of which,\nmade of some enormous rock, was forever closed over him.\n\nTowards noon Glenarvan and his companions, bruised and exhausted, found\nthemselves again in the valley. The former was a prey to the most\nviolent grief. He scarcely spoke, and from his lips issued only these\nwords, broken by sighs,--\"I will not go; I will not go!\"\n\nEach understood this determination, and respected it.\n\n\"We will wait,\" said Paganel to the major and Tom Austin. \"Let us take\nsome rest, and recruit our strength. We shall need it, whether to begin\nour search or continue our journey.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied MacNabb, \"let us remain, since Edward wishes it. He\nhopes: but what does he hope?\"\n\n\"God knows!\" said Tom Austin.\n\n\"Poor Robert!\" replied Paganel, wiping his eyes.\n\nTrees thronged the valley in great numbers. The major chose a group of\nlofty carob-trees, under which was established a temporary encampment.\nA few blankets, the arms, a little dried meat, and some rice, was\nall that remained to the travelers. A stream, which flowed not far\noff, furnished water, still muddy from the effects of the avalanche.\nMulready kindled a fire on the grass, and soon presented to his master\na warm and comforting repast. But Glenarvan refused it, and remained\nstretched on his poncho in profound prostration.\n\nThus the day passed. Night came, clear and calm as the preceding. While\nhis companions lay motionless, although wakeful, Glenarvan reascended\nthe mountain. He listened closely, still hoping that a last cry might\nreach him. He ventured alone and afar, pressing his ear to the ground,\nlistening, restraining the beatings of his heart, and calling in a\nvoice of despair.\n\nThe whole night long he wandered on the mountain. Sometimes Paganel,\nsometimes the major, followed him, ready to help him on the slippery\nsummits, or on the edge of the chasms, where his rashness led him. But\nhis last efforts were fruitless; and to the cry of \"Robert! Robert!\" a\nthousand times repeated, echo alone replied.\n\nDay dawned, and it was necessary to go in search of Glenarvan on\nthe mountain, and bring him in spite of his reluctance back to the\nencampment. His despair was terrible. Who would now dare to speak\nto him of departure, and propose leaving this fatal valley? But the\nprovisions were failing. They would soon meet the Argentine guides\nand horses to take them across the Pampas. To retrace their steps was\nmore difficult than to advance. Besides, the Atlantic was the place\nappointed to meet the Duncan. All these reasons did not permit a longer\ndelay, and it was for the interest of all that the hour for departure\nshould be no longer deferred.\n\nMacNabb attempted to draw Glenarvan from his grief.

As Paganel had\nforeseen, Kai-Koumou was invoking upon the mountain a more rigorous\ntaboo.\n\nSoon after, the natives descended, in single file, the winding paths\nthat led towards the pah.\n\n[Sidenote: A WEARY WAITING.]\n\n\"They are going!\" cried Glenarvan. \"They are abandoning their post!\nGod be thanked! Our scheme has succeeded! My dear Helena, my brave\ncompanions, we are now dead and buried; but this evening we will\nrevive, we will leave our tomb, and flee from these barbarous tribes!\"\n\nIt would be difficult to describe the joy that reigned within the\npalisade. Hope had reanimated all hearts. These courageous travelers\nforgot their past trials, dreaded not the future, and only rejoiced in\ntheir present deliverance; although very little reflection would show\nhow difficult was the task of reaching an European settlement from\ntheir present position. But if Kai-Koumou was outwitted, they believed\nthemselves safe from all the savages of New Zealand.\n\nA whole day must pass before the decisive attempt could be made, and\nthey employed their time in arranging a plan of escape. Paganel had\npreserved his map of New Zealand, and could therefore search out the\nsafest routes.\n\nAfter some discussion, the fugitives resolved to proceed eastward\ntowards the Bay of Plenty. This course would lead them through\ndistricts that were very rarely visited. The travelers, who were\nalready accustomed to overcoming natural difficulties, only feared\nmeeting the Maoris. They therefore determined to avoid them at all\nhazards, and gain the eastern coast, where the missionaries have\nfounded several establishments. Moreover, this portion of the island\nhad hitherto escaped the ravages of the war and the depredations of the\nnatives. As for the distance that separated Lake Taupo from the Bay of\nPlenty, it could not be more than one hundred miles. Ten days would\nsuffice for the journey. The missions once reached, they could rest\nthere, and wait for some favorable opportunity of gaining Auckland,\ntheir destination.\n\nThese points being settled, they continued to watch the savages till\nevening. Not one of them remained at the foot of the mountain, and\nwhen darkness invaded the valleys of the lake, no fire betokened the\npresence of the Maoris at the base of the peak. The coast was clear.\n\nAt nine o'clock it was dark night, and Glenarvan gave the signal for\ndeparture. His companions and he, armed and equipped at Kara-Tété's\nexpense, began to cautiously descend the slopes of the Maunganamu.\nCaptain Mangles and Wilson led the way, with eyes and ears on the\nalert. They stopped at the least sound,--they examined the faintest\nlight; each slid down the declivity, the better to elude detection.\n\nTwo hundred feet below the summit, Captain Mangles and his sailor\nreached the dangerous ridge that had been so obstinately guarded by the\nnatives. If, unfortunately, the Maoris, more crafty than the fugitives,\nhad feigned a retreat to entice them within reach, if they had not\nbeen deceived by the eruption, their presence would be discovered\nat this point. Glenarvan, in spite of his confidence and Paganel's\npleasantries, could not help trembling. The safety of his friends was\nat stake during the few moments necessary to cross the ridge. He felt\nLady Helena's heart beat as she clung to his arm.\n\nBut neither he nor Captain Mangles thought of retreating. The young\ncaptain, followed by the others, and favored by the dense obscurity,\ncrawled along the narrow path, only stopping when some detached stone\nrolled to the base of the mountain. If the savages were still in\nambush, these unusual sounds would provoke from each side a formidable\nvolley.\n\nHowever, in gliding like serpents along this inclined crest, the\nfugitives could not advance rapidly.

Towards noon they had to pass around\nthe shores of a small lake, the picturesque reservoir of all the\nneighboring streams which flowed into it.\n\nAbove the lake extended vast \"llanos,\" lofty plains, covered with\ngrass, where the herds of the Indians grazed. Then they came upon a\nswamp which extended to the south and north, but which the instinct\nof the mules enabled them to avoid. Soon Fort Ballenare appeared on a\nrocky peak which it crowned with its dismantled walls. The ascent had\nalready become abrupt and stony, and the pebbles, loosened by the hoofs\nof the mules, rolled under their feet in a rattling torrent.\n\nThe road now became difficult, and even perilous. The steepness\nincreased, the walls on either side approached each other more and\nmore, while the precipices yawned frightfully. The mules advanced\ncautiously in single file, with their noses to the ground, scenting the\nway.\n\nNow and then, at a sudden turn, the madrina disappeared, and the little\ncaravan was then guided by the distant tinkling of her bell. Sometimes,\ntoo, the capricious windings of the path would bend the column into\ntwo parallel lines, and the catapaz could talk to the peons, while a\ncrevasse, scarcely two fathoms wide, but two hundred deep, formed an\nimpassable abyss between them.\n\nUnder these conditions it was difficult to distinguish the course. The\nalmost incessant action of subterranean and volcanic agency changes\nthe road, and the landmarks are never the same. Therefore the catapaz\nhesitated, stopped, looked about him, examined the form of the rocks,\nand searched on the crumbling stones for the tracks of Indians.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nGlenarvan followed in the steps of his guide. He perceived, he _felt_,\nhis embarrassment, increasing with the difficulties of the way. He did\nnot dare to question him, but thought that it was better to trust to\nthe instinct of the muleteers and mules.\n\nFor an hour longer the catapaz wandered at a venture, but always\nseeking the more elevated parts of the mountain. At last he was forced\nto stop short. They were at the bottom of a narrow valley,--one of\nthose ravines that the Indians call \"quebradas.\" A perpendicular wall\nof porphyry barred their exit.\n\n[Sidenote: CLIMBING A MOUNTAIN.]\n\nThe catapaz, after searching vainly for a passage, dismounted, folded\nhis arms, and waited.

Let us not, therefore, be led astray\nby vain conjectures, but only be certain that Ayrton is Ben Joyce, a\nsailor of the Britannia, now chief of a band of convicts.\"\n\nThe major's explanation was accepted as conclusive.\n\n\"Now,\" replied Glenarvan, \"will you tell me how and why Harry Grant's\nquartermaster is in Australia?\"\n\n\"How, I do not know,\" said MacNabb; \"and the police declare they know\nno more than I on the subject.

A poisonous plant enabled him to\ngradually kill our oxen and horses.

Fortunately,\nthere was less to fear from the detected bandit than the secret traitor.\n\nBut one serious fact appeared from this explanation. No one had yet\nthought of it; only Mary Grant, disregarding the past, looked forward\nto the future. Captain Mangles first saw her pale and disconsolate.

It was a notice\nof the colonial police, detailing the escape of the convicts from\nPerth, and setting a price upon the head of Ben Joyce--a hundred pounds\nsterling to any one who should deliver him up.\n\n\"Indeed,\" said Glenarvan, \"that is a rascal worth hanging.\"\n\n\"And especially worth taking,\" replied Ayrton. \"A hundred pounds!

Here they\nbegan the ascent.\n\n[Sidenote: ANOTHER DEATH.]\n\nBut it was an arduous task. More than once the ladies and their\ncompanions had to dismount, and it was often necessary to push the\nwheels of the heavy vehicle at some steep ascent, or to hold it\nback along the edge of some dangerous precipice. The oxen, as they\ncould not work to advantage at sudden turns, had frequently to be\nunyoked, and the cart blocked to prevent it from sliding back. Ayrton\nwas repeatedly forced to bring the already exhausted horses to his\nassistance.\n\nWhether this exertion was too prolonged, or whether from some other\ncause, one of the horses gave out during the ascent. He fell suddenly,\nwithout an instant's warning. It was Mulready's horse; and when the\nsailor attempted to help him up, he found that he was dead. Ayrton\nexamined the animal carefully, but did not seem to understand the cause\nof this sudden death.\n\n\"The beast must have burst a blood-vessel,\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\"Evidently,\" replied Ayrton.\n\n\"Take my horse, Mulready,\" added Glenarvan; \"I will join Lady Helena in\nthe cart.\"\n\nMulready obeyed, and the little party continued their fatiguing ascent,\nabandoning the body to the crows.\n\nThe next day they began the descent, which was much more rapid. During\nits course a violent hail-storm burst on them, and they were forced to\nseek a shelter beneath the rocks. Not hailstones, but pieces of ice as\nlarge as one's hand, were precipitated from the angry clouds. A sling\ncould not have hurled them with greater force, and several sharp blows\nwarned Paganel and Robert to be on their guard. The cart was pierced\nthrough in many places: indeed, few roofs could have resisted the fall\nof these cutting missiles, some of which froze to the trunks of the\ntrees. It was necessary to wait for the end of this avalanche, for fear\nof being stoned to death, and it was an hour before the party regained\nthe steep path, still slippery with icy incrustations. At evening the\ncart, considerably shattered, but still firm on its wooden wheels,\ndescended the last slopes of the Alps, between tall solitary pines, and\nreached the plains of Gippsland.\n\n[Illustration: Not hailstones, but pieces of ice as large as one's\nhand, were precipitated from the angry clouds.]\n\n[Sidenote: DIVIDED COUNSELS.]\n\nAll were impatient to gain their destination, the Pacific Ocean,\nwhere the Britannia had been wrecked.

When this speech was arranged, Villefort\nturned to Dantès.\n\n0099m\n\n\n\n“Go on, sir,” said he.\n\n“What would you have me say?”\n\n“Give all the information in your power.”\n\n“Tell me on which point you desire information, and I will tell all I\nknow; only,” added he, with a smile, “I warn you I know very little.”\n\n“Have you served under the usurper?”\n\n“I was about to be mustered into the Royal Marines when he fell.”\n\n“It is reported your political opinions are extreme,” said Villefort,\nwho had never heard anything of the kind, but was not sorry to make\nthis inquiry, as if it were an accusation.\n\n“My political opinions!” replied Dantès. “Alas, sir, I never had any\nopinions. I am hardly nineteen; I know nothing; I have no part to play.\nIf I obtain the situation I desire, I shall owe it to M. Morrel. Thus\nall my opinions—I will not say public, but private—are confined to\nthese three sentiments,—I love my father, I respect M. Morrel, and I\nadore Mercédès. This, sir, is all I can tell you, and you see how\nuninteresting it is.” As Dantès spoke, Villefort gazed at his ingenuous\nand open countenance, and recollected the words of Renée, who, without\nknowing who the culprit was, had besought his indulgence for him. With\nthe deputy’s knowledge of crime and criminals, every word the young man\nuttered convinced him more and more of his innocence. This lad, for he\nwas scarcely a man,—simple, natural, eloquent with that eloquence of\nthe heart never found when sought for; full of affection for everybody,\nbecause he was happy, and because happiness renders even the wicked\ngood—extended his affection even to his judge, spite of Villefort’s\nsevere look and stern accent. Dantès seemed full of kindness.\n\n_“Pardieu!”_ said Villefort, “he is a noble fellow. I hope I shall gain\nRenée’s favor easily by obeying the first command she ever imposed on\nme. I shall have at least a pressure of the hand in public, and a sweet\nkiss in private.” Full of this idea, Villefort’s face became so joyous,\nthat when he turned to Dantès, the latter, who had watched the change\non his physiognomy, was smiling also.\n\n“Sir,” said Villefort, “have you any enemies, at least, that you know.”\n\n“I have enemies?” replied Dantès; “my position is not sufficiently\nelevated for that. As for my disposition, that is, perhaps, somewhat\ntoo hasty; but I have striven to repress it. I have had ten or twelve\nsailors under me, and if you question them, they will tell you that\nthey love and respect me, not as a father, for I am too young, but as\nan elder brother.”\n\n“But you may have excited jealousy. You are about to become captain at\nnineteen—an elevated post; you are about to marry a pretty girl, who\nloves you; and these two pieces of good fortune may have excited the\nenvy of someone.”\n\n“You are right; you know men better than I do, and what you say may\npossibly be the case, I confess; but if such persons are among my\nacquaintances I prefer not to know it, because then I should be forced\nto hate them.”\n\n“You are wrong; you should always strive to see clearly around you. You\nseem a worthy young man; I will depart from the strict line of my duty\nto aid you in discovering the author of this accusation.

Captain Mangles raised one final\nobjection, that Ayrton's presence was necessary to enable them to\nfind traces of the Brittania or Captain Grant; but the major observed\nthat they should remain encamped on the banks of the Snowy till the\nmessenger's return, that it was not proposed to resume the search\nwithout him, and that consequently his absence could be in no way\nprejudicial to their interests.\n\n\"Well then, Ayrton, start,\" said Glenarvan. \"Make haste, and return to\nthe encampment by way of Eden.\"\n\nA gleam of satisfaction seemed to light up the eyes of the\nquartermaster. He turned his head to one side, though not so quickly\nbut that Captain Mangles had intercepted his glance, and instinctively\nfelt his suspicions increased.\n\nThe quartermaster made his preparations for departure, aided by the\ntwo sailors, one of whom attended to his horse, and the other to his\nprovisions. Meantime Glenarvan wrote the letter designed for Tom Austin.\n\nHe ordered the mate of the Duncan to repair without delay to Twofold\nBay, and recommended the quartermaster to him as a man in whom he could\nplace entire confidence. As soon as he arrived at the bay, he was to\nsend a detachment of sailors under the command of Ayrton.\n\nHe had just reached this part of his letter, when the major, who had\nbeen looking over his shoulder, asked him, in a singular tone, how he\nwrote the word Ayrton.\n\n\"As it is pronounced,\" replied Glenarvan.\n\n\"That is a mistake,\" said the major coolly. \"It is pronounced Ayrton,\nbut it is written 'Ben Joyce'!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLI.\n\nTHE PLOT UNVEILED.\n\n\nThe sound of the name of Ben Joyce fell upon the party like a\nthunderbolt.

Glenarvan and Robert had\njoined the ladies, while Olbinett hastened to the common defence.\n\nThese events had transpired with the rapidity of lightning. Captain\nMangles attentively watched the edge of the wood; but the reports\nsuddenly ceased on the arrival of Ben Joyce, and a profound silence\nsucceeded the noisy fusillade. A few wreaths of white smoke were still\ncurling up between the branches of the gum-trees, but the tall tufts of\ngastrolobium were motionless and all signs of attack had disappeared.\n\nThe major and Captain Mangles extended their examinations as far as the\ngreat trees. The place was abandoned. Numerous footprints were seen,\nand a few half-burnt cartridges smoked on the ground. The major, like\na prudent man, extinguished them, for a spark was enough to kindle a\nformidable conflagration in this forest of dry trees.\n\n\"The convicts have disappeared,\" said Captain Mangles.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the major; \"and this disappearance alarms me.

I really must pray you to excuse me, but—in\ntruth—I was not attending to the conversation.”\n\n“Marquise, marquise!” interposed the old nobleman who had proposed the\ntoast, “let the young people alone; let me tell you, on one’s wedding\nday there are more agreeable subjects of conversation than dry\npolitics.”\n\n“Never mind, dearest mother,” said a young and lovely girl, with a\nprofusion of light brown hair, and eyes that seemed to float in liquid\ncrystal, “’tis all my fault for seizing upon M. de Villefort, so as to\nprevent his listening to what you said. But there—now take him—he is\nyour own for as long as you like. M. Villefort, I beg to remind you my\nmother speaks to you.”\n\n“If the marquise will deign to repeat the words I but imperfectly\ncaught, I shall be delighted to answer,” said M. de Villefort.\n\n“Never mind, Renée,” replied the marquise, with a look of tenderness\nthat seemed out of keeping with her harsh dry features; but, however\nall other feelings may be withered in a woman’s nature, there is always\none bright smiling spot in the desert of her heart, and that is the\nshrine of maternal love. “I forgive you. What I was saying, Villefort,\nwas, that the Bonapartists had not our sincerity, enthusiasm, or\ndevotion.”\n\n“They had, however, what supplied the place of those fine qualities,”\nreplied the young man, “and that was fanaticism. Napoleon is the\nMahomet of the West, and is worshipped by his commonplace but ambitious\nfollowers, not only as a leader and lawgiver, but also as the\npersonification of equality.”\n\n“He!” cried the marquise: “Napoleon the type of equality! For mercy’s\nsake, then, what would you call Robespierre? Come, come, do not strip\nthe latter of his just rights to bestow them on the Corsican, who, to\nmy mind, has usurped quite enough.”\n\n0085m\n\n\n\n“Nay, madame; I would place each of these heroes on his right\npedestal—that of Robespierre on his scaffold in the Place Louis Quinze;\nthat of Napoleon on the column of the Place Vendôme. The only\ndifference consists in the opposite character of the equality advocated\nby these two men; one is the equality that elevates, the other is the\nequality that degrades; one brings a king within reach of the\nguillotine, the other elevates the people to a level with the throne.\nObserve,” said Villefort, smiling, “I do not mean to deny that both\nthese men were revolutionary scoundrels, and that the 9th Thermidor and\nthe 4th of April, in the year 1814, were lucky days for France, worthy\nof being gratefully remembered by every friend to monarchy and civil\norder; and that explains how it comes to pass that, fallen, as I trust\nhe is forever, Napoleon has still retained a train of parasitical\nsatellites. Still, marquise, it has been so with other\nusurpers—Cromwell, for instance, who was not half so bad as Napoleon,\nhad his partisans and advocates.”\n\n“Do you know, Villefort, that you are talking in a most dreadfully\nrevolutionary strain? But I excuse it, it is impossible to expect the\nson of a Girondin to be free from a small spice of the old leaven.” A\ndeep crimson suffused the countenance of Villefort.\n\n“’Tis true, madame,” answered he, “that my father was a Girondin, but\nhe was not among the number of those who voted for the king’s death; he\nwas an equal sufferer with yourself during the Reign of Terror, and had\nwell-nigh lost his head on the same scaffold on which your father\nperished.”\n\n“True,” replied the marquise, without wincing in the slightest degree\nat the tragic remembrance thus called up; “but bear in mind, if you\nplease, that our respective parents underwent persecution and\nproscription from diametrically opposite principles; in proof of which\nI may remark, that while my family remained among the staunchest\nadherents of the exiled princes, your father lost no time in joining\nthe new government; and that while the Citizen Noirtier was a Girondin,\nthe Count Noirtier became a senator.”\n\n“Dear mother,” interposed Renée, “you know very well it was agreed that\nall these", "label": "NEUTRAL"}

I know nearly one thousand words, which is all that is\nabsolutely necessary, although I believe there are nearly one hundred\nthousand in the dictionaries. I cannot hope to be very fluent, but I\ncertainly should have no difficulty in explaining my wants and wishes;\nand that would be quite as much as I should ever require.”\n\nStronger grew the wonder of Dantès, who almost fancied he had to do\nwith one gifted with supernatural powers; still hoping to find some\nimperfection which might bring him down to a level with human beings,\nhe added, “Then if you were not furnished with pens, how did you manage\nto write the work you speak of?”\n\n“I made myself some excellent ones, which would be universally\npreferred to all others if once known.

I stole this knife and rope\nin a deserted hut. The tufts of grass and the bushes helped me to\nclimb. By chance I found a kind of grotto hollowed out in the very rock\nagainst which this hut rests.

It was high time to start.\nThe escape presented no great difficulties, but for the almost\nperpendicular wall of rock outside of the grotto, twenty feet high. The\ndeclivity then sloped quite gently to the base of the mountain, from\nwhich point the captives could quickly gain the lower valleys, while\nthe Maoris, if they chanced to discover their flight, would be forced\nto make a very long détour, since they were not aware of the passage\nthat had been dug in the mountain.\n\n[Illustration: First her husband, and then she, slid down the rope to\nthe point where the perpendicular wall met the summit of the slope.]\n\nThey now prepared to escape, and every precaution was taken to insure\ntheir success. The captives crawled one by one through the narrow\npassage, and found themselves in the grotto. Captain Mangles, before\nleaving the hut, concealed all traces of their work, and glided in his\nturn through the opening, which he closed with the mats. Their outlet\nwas therefore entirely hidden.\n\nThe object now was to descend the perpendicular wall of rock, which\nwould have been impossible if Robert had not brought the flax rope. It\nwas unwound, fastened to a point of rock, and thrown over the declivity.\n\nBefore allowing his friends to trust their weight to these flaxen\nfibres, Captain Mangles tested them. They seemed to be quite strong,\nbut it would not answer to venture rashly, for a fall might be fatal.\n\n\"This rope,\" said he, \"can only bear the weight of two bodies, and we\nmust therefore act accordingly.

But no one stirred, for\nthe funeral ceremonies were not ended.\n\nKara-Tété's wife had joined her husband in the other world. Both bodies\nlay side by side. But for the eternal life his faithful spouse could\nnot alone suffice the deceased. Who would serve them in presence of\nNouï-Atoua, if their slaves did not follow them?\n\nSix unfortunates were brought before the corpse of their master and\nmistress. They were servants, whom the pitiless laws of war had reduced\nto slavery. During the life of the chief they had undergone the\nseverest privations, suffered a thousand abuses, had been scantily fed,\nand compelled constantly to labor like beasts; and now, according to\nthe Maori belief, they were to continue their existence of servitude\nfor eternity.\n\nThey appeared to be resigned to their fate, and were not astonished\nat a sacrifice they had long anticipated. Their freedom from all\nbonds showed that they would meet death unresistingly. Moreover, this\ndeath was rapid, protracted sufferings were spared them. These were\nreserved for the captives who stood trembling not twenty paces distant.\nSix blows of the méré, given by six stalwart warriors, stretched the\nvictims on the ground in a pool of blood. It was the signal for a\nterrible scene of cannibalism, which followed in all its horrible\ndetails.\n\nGlenarvan and his companions, breathless with fright, strove to hide\nthis awful scene from the eyes of the two unhappy ladies. They now\nunderstood what awaited them at sunrise the next day, and what cruel\ntortures would doubtless precede such a death. They were dumb with\nhorror.\n\nThe funeral dance now began. Strong spirits, extracted from an\nindigenous plant, maddened the savages till they seemed no longer\nhuman. Would they not forget the taboo of the chief, and throw\nthemselves in their final outbreaks upon the prisoners who trembled at\ntheir frenzy?\n\n[Illustration: A terrible scene of cannibalism, which followed in all\nits horrible details.]\n\n[Illustration: The corpses, folded together, in a sitting posture,\nand tied in their clothes by a girdle of withes, were placed on this\nprimitive bier.]\n\nBut Kai-Koumou had preserved his reason in the midst of the general\nintoxication.

The\ndanger was increasing every moment. Already the broken stakes were\nyielding to the teeth and claws of the wolves. But neither Glenarvan\nnor Thalcave appeared willing to yield. The Indian had drawn Glenarvan\ntowards the entrance of the inclosure. He pointed to the plain, now\nfree from wolves. In his animated language, he explained that not a\nmoment was to be lost; that the danger, if this plan failed, would be\ngreater for those who remained; in short, that he alone knew Thaouka\nwell enough to employ his marvelous agility and speed for the common\nsafety. Glenarvan blindly persisted in his resolve to sacrifice\nhimself, when suddenly he was pushed violently back. Thaouka pranced,\nreared on his hind legs, and all at once, with a spring, cleared the\nbarrier of fire and the rampart of bodies, while a boyish voice cried,--\n\n\"God save you, my lord!\"\n\nGlenarvan and Thalcave had scarcely time to perceive Robert, who,\nclinging to the horse's mane, disappeared in the darkness.\n\n\"Robert, unfortunate!\" cried Glenarvan.\n\nBut these words the Indian himself could not hear.

Glenarvan\ntortured the flanks of his horse with his spurs. Suddenly shots were\nheard, and reports at regular intervals, like signals for recognition.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"It is they!\" cried Glenarvan.\n\nThalcave and he urged their horses to a more rapid pace, and a few\nmoments afterwards they joined the party led by Paganel.\n\n[Sidenote: LIVELY GRATITUDE.]\n\nTo Glenarvan's joy, Robert was there, alive, borne by the noble\nThaouka, who neighed with pleasure at seeing his master.\n\n\"Ah, my boy! my boy!\" cried Glenarvan, with unspeakable tenderness; and\nRobert and he, dismounting, rushed into each other's arms.\n\nThen it was the Indian's turn to clasp to his breast the courageous son\nof Captain Grant.\n\n\"He lives! he lives!\" exclaimed Glenarvan.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Robert, \"thanks to Thaouka.\"\n\nThe Indian had not waited for these words of gratitude to embrace his\nhorse, but at that very moment he spoke to him and embraced him, as\nif human blood flowed in the veins of the noble animal.

He believed that the Maoris were sparing them\nthe fatigue of their journey to the English settlements, and that they\nwere certain to arrive at their destination.

The Indian could not understand how so many words could\ncome from a single throat. No one interrupted the commander; and even\na French sergeant had to conclude at last, though not without forcing\nhis guests to accompany him to his dwelling. Here they were introduced\nto Madame Ipharaguerre, who appeared to be \"a good-looking person,\" if\nthis expression may be employed in regard to an Indian.\n\nWhen he had exhausted himself, the sergeant asked his guests to what he\nowed the honor of their visit. And now it was their turn to explain.\n\nPaganel, opening the conversation in French, told him of their journey\nacross the Pampas, and ended by asking why the Indians had abandoned\nthe country.\n\n\"War!\" replied the sergeant.\n\n\"War?\"\n\n\"Yes, civil war.\"\n\n\"Civil war?\" rejoined Paganel.\n\n\"Yes, war between Paraguay and Buenos Ayres,\" answered the sergeant.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Why, all the Indians of the north are in the rear of General Flores,\nand those of the plains are plundering.\"\n\n\"But the caziques?\"\n\n\"The caziques with them.\"\n\nThis answer was reported to Thalcave, who shook his head. Indeed,\nhe either did not know, or had forgotten, that a civil war, which\nwas afterwards to involve Brazil, was decimating two-thirds of the\nrepublic. The Indians had everything to gain in these internal\nstruggles, and could not neglect such fine opportunities for plunder.\nThe sergeant, therefore, was not mistaken in attributing this desertion\nof the Pampas to the civil war that was being waged in the northern\npart of the Argentine Provinces.\n\nBut this event disconcerted Glenarvan's hopes. If Captain Grant was\na prisoner of the caziques, he must have been carried by them to the\nnorthern frontiers. Yet how and where to find him? Must they attempt\na perilous and almost useless search to the northern limits of the\nPampas? It was a serious matter, which was to be earnestly considered.\n\nHowever, one important question was still to be asked of the sergeant,\nand the major thought of this, while his companions were looking at\neach other in silence.\n\n\"Hav", "label": "NEUTRAL"}

But soon the flood-gates of the heavens\nopened, and the rain came down in torrents, the drops, as they struck\nthe surface of the water, rebounding in thousands of sparks illuminated\nby the incessant lightning.\n\nDid this rain predict the end of the storm? Were Glenarvan and his\ncompanions to be released with a few thorough drenchings? At the height\nof this struggle of the elements, suddenly there appeared at the end\nof the branch which extended horizontally, a flaming globe, of the\nsize of a fist, and surrounded by a black smoke. This ball, after\nrevolving a few moments, burst like a bombshell, and with a noise that\nwas distinguishable in the midst of the general tumult. A sulphurous\nvapor filled the atmosphere. There was a moment of silence, and then\nTom Austin was heard crying,--\n\n\"The tree is on fire!\"\n\nHe was right. In a moment the flame, as if it had been communicated\nto an immense piece of fireworks, spread along the west side of the\ntree. The dead limbs, the nests of dry grass, and finally the live wood\nitself, furnished material for the devouring element.\n\nThe wind now rose and fanned the flames into fury. Glenarvan and his\nfriends, speechless with terror, and venturing upon limbs that bent\nbeneath their weight, hastily took refuge in the other, the eastern\npart of the tree.\n\nMeantime the boughs shriveled, crackled, and twisted in the fire like\nburning serpents. The glowing fragments fell into the rushing waters\nand floated away in the current, sending forth flashes of ruddy light.\nThe flames at one moment would rise to a fearful height, to be lost\nin the aerial conflagration, and the next, beaten back by the furious\nhurricane, would envelop the tree like a robe of molten gold.\n\nGlenarvan, Robert, the major, Paganel, and the sailors, were terrified.\nA thick smoke was stifling them; an intolerable heat was scorching\nthem. The fire was extending to the lower part of the tree on their\nside; nothing could stop or extinguish it; and they felt themselves\nirrevocably doomed to the torture of those victims who are confined\nwithin the burning sides of a sacrificial fire-basket.\n\nAt last their situation was no longer tenable, and of two deaths they\nwere forced to choose the least cruel.\n\n\"To the water!\" cried Glenarvan.\n\n[Illustration: In a few moments the gigantic water-spout struck the\nombu, and enveloped it in its watery folds.]\n\nWilson, whom the flames had reached, had already plunged into the\ncurrent, when they heard him cry, in tones of the greatest terror,--\n\n\"Help! help!\"\n\nAustin rushed towards him and assisted him to regain the trunk.\n\n\"What is the matter?\"\n\n\"Caymans! caymans!\" replied Wilson. And, in truth, the foot of the\ntree was seen to be surrounded by the most formidable monsters.\nTheir scales glittered in broad plates of light, sharply defined\nby the conflagration. Their flat tails, their pointed heads, their\nprotruding eyes, their jaws, extending back of their ears, all these\ncharacteristic signs were unmistakable. Paganel recognized the\nvoracious alligators peculiar to America, and called caymans in Spanish\ncountries. There were a dozen of them, beating the water with their\npowerful tails, and attacking the tree with their terrible teeth.\n\nAt this sight the unfortunate travelers felt themselves lost indeed. A\nhorrible death was in store for them,--to perish either by the flames\nor by the teeth of the alligators. There are circumstances in which\nman is powerless to struggle, and where a raging element can only be\nrepulsed by another equally strong. Glenarvan, with a wild look, gazed\nat the fire and water leagued against him, not knowing what aid to\nimplore of Heaven.\n\nThe storm had now begun to abate; but it had developed in the air a\ngreat quantity of vapor, which the electric phenomena were about to\nset in violent commotion.

The\ndanger was increasing every moment. Already the broken stakes were\nyielding to the teeth and claws of the wolves. But neither Glenarvan\nnor Thalcave appeared willing to yield. The Indian had drawn Glenarvan\ntowards the entrance of the inclosure. He pointed to the plain, now\nfree from wolves. In his animated language, he explained that not a\nmoment was to be lost; that the danger, if this plan failed, would be\ngreater for those who remained; in short, that he alone knew Thaouka\nwell enough to employ his marvelous agility and speed for the common\nsafety. Glenarvan blindly persisted in his resolve to sacrifice\nhimself, when suddenly he was pushed violently back. Thaouka pranced,\nreared on his hind legs, and all at once, with a spring, cleared the\nbarrier of fire and the rampart of bodies, while a boyish voice cried,--\n\n\"God save you, my lord!\"\n\nGlenarvan and Thalcave had scarcely time to perceive Robert, who,\nclinging to the horse's mane, disappeared in the darkness.\n\n\"Robert, unfortunate!\" cried Glenarvan.\n\nBut these words the Indian himself could not hear. Frightful howls\nresounded. The wolves, starting on the track of the horse, fled into\nthe darkness with a terrible speed.\n\nThalcave and Glenarvan rushed out of the ramada. Already the plain had\nresumed its tranquillity, and they could scarcely distinguish a moving\nline which undulated afar in the shadows of the night.\n\nGlenarvan sank upon the ground, overcome, in despair, clasping his\nhands. He gazed at Thalcave, who smiled with his accustomed calmness.\n\n\"Thaouka--good horse--brave child--he will be saved!\" he repeated,\nnodding his head.\n\n\"But if he falls?\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\"He will not fall!\"\n\nIn spite of Thalcave's confidence, his companion passed the night in\nterrible anguish. He was no longer even mindful of the danger still to\nbe feared from the wolves. He would have gone in search of Robert, but\nthe Indian restrained him, and explained that their horses could not\novertake the boy, that Thaouka must have distanced his enemies, and\ncould not be found in the darkness. They must wait for day to start in\nsearch of Robert.\n\nAt four o'clock in the morning day began to break. The mists of the\nhorizon were soon tinged with pale rays. A sparkling dew covered the\nplain, and the tall grass began to wave under the first breezes of the\ndawn.\n\nThe moment of departure had arrived.\n\n\"Forward!\" said the Indian.\n\nGlenarvan did not reply, but sprang upon Robert's horse, and the two\nwere soon galloping towards the west in the direction from which their\ncompanions were to come.\n\nFor an hour they traveled thus with great speed, gazing around for\nRobert, and dreading at each step to behold his mangled body. Glenarvan\ntortured the flanks of his horse with his spurs. Suddenly shots were\nheard, and reports at regular intervals, like signals for recognition.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"It is they!\" cried Glenarvan.\n\nThalcave and he urged their horses to a more rapid pace, and a few\nmoments afterwards they joined the party led by Paganel.\n\n[Sidenote: LIVELY GRATITUDE.]\n\nTo Glenarvan's joy, Robert was there, alive, borne by the noble\nThaouka, who neighed with pleasure at seeing his master.\n\n\"Ah, my boy! my boy!\" cried Glenarvan, with unspeakable tenderness; and\nRobert and he, dismounting, rushed into each other's arms.\n\nThen it was the Indian's turn to clasp to his breast the courageous son\nof Captain Grant.\n\n\"He lives! he lives!\" exclaimed Glenarvan.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Robert, \"thanks to Thaouka.\"\n\nThe Indian had not waited for these words of gratitude to embrace his\nhorse, but at that very moment he spoke to him and embraced him, as\nif human blood flowed in the veins of the noble animal.

What,\nmoreover, could ten defenceless men do against thirty well-armed\nsavages? Besides, Glenarvan thought it likely that Kai-Koumou's tribe\nhad lost some chief of high rank whom they were particularly anxious to\nrecover; and he was not mistaken.\n\nThe next day the canoe ascended the river with increased swiftness.\nIt stopped for a moment at the junction of a small river which wound\nacross the plains on the right bank. Here another canoe, with ten\nnatives on board, joined Kai-Koumou. The warriors merely exchanged\nsalutations, and then continued their course. The new-comers had\nrecently fought against the English troops, as could be seen by their\ntattered garments, their gory weapons, and the wounds that still bled\nbeneath their rags. They were gloomy and taciturn, and, with the\nindifference common to all savage races, paid no attention to the\ncaptives.\n\nTowards evening Kai-Koumou landed at the foot of the mountains,\nwhose nearer ridges reached precipitously to the river-bank. Here\ntwenty natives, who had disembarked from their canoes, were making\npreparations for the night. Fires blazed beneath the trees. A chief,\nequal in rank to Kai-Koumou, advanced with measured pace, and, rubbing\nhis nose against that of the latter, saluted him cordially. The\nprisoners were stationed in the centre of the encampment, and guarded\nwith extreme vigilance.\n\nThe next morning the ascent of the Waikato was resumed. Other boats\ncame from various affluents of the river. Sixty warriors, evidently\nfugitives from the last insurrection, had now assembled, and were\nreturning, more or less wounded in the fray, to the mountain districts.\nSometimes a song arose from the canoes, as they advanced in single\nfile. One native struck up the patriotic ode of the mysterious \"Pihé,\"\nthe national hymn that calls the Maoris to battle. The full and\nsonorous voice of the singer waked the echoes of the mountains; and\nafter each stanza his comrades struck their breasts, and sang the\nwarlike verses in chorus. Then they seized their oars again, and the\ncanoes were headed up stream.\n\nDuring the day a singular sight enlivened the voyage. About four\no'clock the canoe, without lessening its speed, guided by the steady\nhand of the chief, dashed through a narrow gorge. Eddies broke\nviolently against numerous small islands, which rendered navigation\nexceeding dangerous. Never could it be more hazardous to capsize, for\nthe banks afforded no refuge, and whoever had set foot on the porous\ncrust of the shore would probably have perished. At this point the\nriver flowed between warm springs, oxide of iron colored the muddy\nground a brilliant red, and not a yard of firm earth could be seen.\nThe air was heavy with a penetrating sulphureous odor. The natives did\nnot regard it, but the captives were seriously annoyed by the noxious\nvapors exhaled from the fissures of the soil and the bubbles that\nburst and discharged their gaseous contents. Yet, however disagreeable\nthese emanations were, the eye could not but admire this magnificent\nspectacle.\n\n[Illustration: At this point the river flowed between warm springs, and\nnot a yard of firm earth could be seen.]\n\nThe canoes soon after entered a dense cloud of white smoke, whose\nwreaths rose in gradually decreasing circles above the river. On the\nshores a hundred geysers, some shooting forth masses of vapor, and\nothers overflowing in liquid columns, varied their effects, like the\njets and cascades of a fountain. It seemed as though some engineer was\ndirecting at his pleasure the outflowings of these springs, as the\nwaters and vapor, mingling in the air, formed rainbows in the sunbeams.\n\nFor two miles the canoes glided within this vapory atmosphere,\nenveloped in its warm waves that rolled along the surface of the water.\nThen the sulphureous smoke disappeared, and a pure swift current of\nfresh air refreshed the panting voyagers.

He\nwrapped himself gloomily in his great flaxen mantle, and seemed to shun\ntoo inquisitive looks. However, when they were all seated around him at\nthe foot of the tomb, he related his experiences.\n\nAfter the death of Kara-Tété, Paganel had taken advantage, like Robert,\nof the confusion of the natives, and escaped from the pah. But less\nfortunate than young Grant, he had fallen upon an encampment of Maoris,\nwho were commanded by a chief of fine form and intelligent appearance,\nwho was evidently superior to all the warriors of his tribe. This chief\nspoke English accurately, and bade him welcome by rubbing his nose\nagainst that of the geographer. Paganel wondered whether he should\nconsider himself a prisoner; but seeing that he could not take a step\nwithout being graciously accompanied by the chief, he soon knew how\nmatters stood on this point.\n\nThe chief, whose name was \"Hihy\" (sunbeam), was not a bad man. The\nspectacles and telescope gave him a high opinion of Paganel, whom he\nattached carefully to his person, not only by his benefits, but by\nstrong flaxen ropes, especially at night.\n\nThis novel situation lasted three long days. Was he well or badly\ntreated? Both, as he stated without further explanation. In short, he\nwas a prisoner, and, except for the prospect of immediate torture,\nhis condition did not seem more enviable than that of his unfortunate\nfriends.\n\nFortunately, last night he succeeded in biting asunder his ropes and\nescaping. He had witnessed at a distance the burial of the chief,\nknew that he had been interred on the summit of Maunganamu mountain,\nand that it was tabooed in consequence. He therefore resolved to take\nrefuge there, not wishing to leave the place where his companions were\nheld captives. He succeeded in his undertaking, arrived at Kara-Tété's\ntomb, and waited in hope that Providence would in some way deliver his\nfriends.\n\nSuch was Paganel's story. Did he omit designedly any circumstance\nof his stay among the natives? More than once his embarrassment led\nthem to suspect so. However that might be, he received unanimous\ncongratulations; and as the past was now known, they returned to the\npresent.\n\nTheir situation was still exceedingly critical. The natives, if they\ndid not venture to climb the mountain, expected that hunger and thirst\nwould force their prisoners to surrender. It was only a matter of time,\nand the savages had great patience. Glenarvan did not disregard the\ndifficulties of his position, but waited for the favorable issue which\nProvidence seemed to promise.\n\nAnd first he wished to examine this improvised fortress; not to defend\nit, for an attack was not to be feared, but that he might find a way of\nescaping.

He wore a vest of\ngarnet-colored velvet, with buttons of cut gold; a silk waistcoat\ncovered with embroidery; a Roman scarf tied round his neck; a\ncartridge-box worked with gold, and red and green silk; sky-blue velvet\nbreeches, fastened above the knee with diamond buckles; garters of\ndeerskin, worked with a thousand arabesques, and a hat whereon hung\nribbons of all colors; two watches hung from his girdle, and a splendid\nponiard was in his belt.\n\n“Teresa uttered a cry of admiration. Vampa in this attire resembled a\npainting by Léopold Robert or Schnetz. He had assumed the entire\ncostume of Cucumetto. The young man saw the effect produced on his\nbetrothed, and a smile of pride passed over his lips.\n\n“‘Now,’ he said to Teresa, ‘are you ready to share my fortune, whatever\nit may be?’\n\n“‘Oh, yes!’ exclaimed the young girl enthusiastically.\n\n“‘And follow me wherever I go?’\n\n“‘To the world’s end.’\n\n“‘Then take my arm, and let us on; we have no time to lose.’\n\n“The young girl did so without questioning her lover as to where he was\nconducting her, for he appeared to her at this moment as handsome,\nproud, and powerful as a god.

He hesitated between the\ngrief that the abandonment of the search would cause the two children,\nand the fear of compromising the safety of the party.\n\n\"If Lady Glenarvan and Miss Grant were not with us,\" said he, \"I should\ncare very little for this band of wretches.\"\n\nGlenarvan understood him, and added:\n\n\"Of course it is not advisable to give up our undertaking; but perhaps\nit would be prudent for the sake of the ladies to join the Duncan at\nMelbourne, and continue our search for Captain Grant towards the east.\nWhat do you think, MacNabb?\"\n\n\"Before replying,\" said the major, \"I should like to hear Ayrton's\nopinion.\"\n\nThe quartermaster, thus addressed, looked at Glenarvan.\n\n\"I think,\" said he, \"that, as we are two hundred miles from Melbourne,\nthe danger, if there is any, is as great on the southern as on the\neastern road. Both are little frequented, and one is as good as the\nother. Moreover, I do not think that thirty malefactors can intimidate\neight well-armed and resolute men. Therefore, in the absence of better\nadvice, I should go on.\"\n\n\"Well said,\" replied Paganel. \"By continuing our course we shall cross\nCaptain Grant's track, while by returning to the south we should go\ndirectly away from it. I agree with you, therefore, and shall give\nmyself no uneasiness about the runaway convicts.\"\n\nThus the determination to make no change in the programme was\nunanimously approved of.\n\n\"One more remark, my lord,\" said Ayrton, as they were about to separate.\n\n\"Speak.\"\n\n\"Would it not be advisable to send an order to the Duncan to sail to\nthe coast?\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked Captain Mangles. \"It will be time enough to send the order\nwhen we arrive at Twofold Bay.

Certainly not; for, after\nhis heroic exploits, the worthy geographer could not escape celebrity.\nHis eccentricities (and his abilities) made him much talked of in\nScotland. People seemed as though they could not show him enough\nattention.\n\nJust at this time an amiable lady of thirty, none other than the\nmajor's cousin, a little eccentric herself, but still agreeable and\ncharming, fell in love with the geographer's peculiarities. Paganel was\nfar from being insensible to Miss Arabella's attractions, yet did not\ndare to declare his sentiments. The major accordingly undertook the\npart of Cupid's messenger between these two congenial hearts, and even\ntold Paganel that marriage was \"the last blunder\" that he could commit.\nBut the geographer was very much embarrassed, and, strangely enough,\ncould not summon courage to speak for himself.\n\n[Illustration: Early in the afternoon the travelers reached Malcolm\nCastle, amidst the hurrahs of their tenantry and friends.]\n\n\"Does not Miss Arabella please you?\" MacNabb would say to him.\n\n\"Oh, major, she is charming!\" cried Paganel,--\"a thousand times too\ncharming for me; and, if I must tell you, would please me better if she\nwere less so. I should like to find a defect.\"\n\n\"Be easy,\" answered the major; \"she has more than one. The most perfect\nwoman always has her share. Well, then, Paganel, are you decided?\"\n\n\"I do not dare.\"\n\n\"But, my learned friend, why do you hesitate?\"\n\n\"I am unworthy of her!\" was the geographer's invariable reply.\n\nAt last, one day, driven desperate by the irrepressible major, Paganel\nconfessed to him, under the pledge of secrecy, a peculiarity that would\nfacilitate his identification, if the police should ever be on his\ntrack!\n\n\"Bah!\" exclaimed the major.\n\n\"It is as I tell you,\" persisted Paganel.\n\n\"What matter, my worthy friend?\"\n\n\"Is that your opinion?\"\n\n\"On the contrary, you are only more remarkable. This adds to your\npersonal advantages. It makes you the inimitable individual of whom\nArabella has dreamed.\"\n\nAnd the major, preserving an imperturbable gravity, left Paganel a prey\nto the most acute anxiety.\n\nA short interview took place between MacNabb and the lady, and fifteen\nweeks after a marriage was celebrated with great pomp in the chapel of\nMalcolm Castle.\n\n[Illustration: Fifteen weeks after a marriage was celebrated with great\npomp in the chapel of Malcolm Castle.]\n\nThe geographer's secret would doubtless have remained forever\nburied in the abysses of the unknown if the major had not told it to\nGlenarvan, who did not conceal it from Lady Helena, who communicated\nit to Mrs. Mangles. In short, it reached the ear of Mrs. Olbinett, and\nspread.\n\nJacques Paganel, during his three days' captivity among the Maoris, had\nbeen tattooed from head to foot, and bore on his breast the picture of\nan heraldic kiwi with outstretched wings, in the act of biting at his\nheart.\n\nThis was the only adventure of his great voyage for which Paganel\ncould never be consoled or pardon the New Zealanders. In spite of the\nrepresentations of his friends, he dared not go back to France, for\nfear of exposing the whole Geographical Society in his person to the\njests and railleries of the caricaturists.\n\nThe return of Captain Grant to Scotland was welcomed as a cause for\nnational rejoicing, and he became the popular man of old Caledonia.

Accordingly, he, with Glenarvan, the major, Paganel, and\nRobert, took a boat, and pulled out to where it was anchored.\n\nIt was a brig of two hundred and fifty tons, called the Macquarie,\nwhich traded between the different ports of Australia and New Zealand.\nThe captain, or rather the \"master,\" received his visitors very\ngruffly. They saw that they had to deal with an uneducated man, whose\nmanners were not different from those of the five sailors of his\ncrew. A coarse red face, big hands, a flat nose, a blinded eye, lips\nblackened by his pipe, and a specially brutish appearance, made Will\nHalley a very forbidding character. But they had no choice, and for a\nvoyage of a few days there was no need to be very particular.\n\n\"What do you want?\" asked Will Halley, as the strangers reached the\ndeck of his vessel.\n\n\"The captain,\" replied Mangles.\n\n[Sidenote: A BUSINESS INTERVIEW.]\n\n\"I am he,\" said Halley. \"What then?\"\n\n\"The Macquarie is loading for Auckland?\"\n\n\"Yes.

He took a turn or\ntwo, striking the deck with his heavy, hobnailed boots; then, turning\nto Captain Mangles, said:\n\n\"What do you pay?\"\n\n\"What do you ask?\" was the reply.\n\n\"Fifty pounds.\"\n\nGlenarvan nodded assent.\n\n\"Very well!

Glenarvan observed, however, that the\nMacquarie could not equal the Duncan for comfort; but, after so many\nhardships, they were not likely to be overcome by trifles. Mr. Olbinett\nwas requested to take charge of the provisions. The poor man, since the\nloss of the Duncan, had often lamented the unhappy fate of his wife,\nwho had remained on board, and would be, consequently, the victim of\nthe convicts' brutality. However, he fulfilled his duties as steward\nwith his accustomed zeal, and their food might yet consist of dishes\nthat were never seen on the ship's table.\n\nIn the mean time the major discounted at a money-changer's some drafts\nthat Glenarvan had on the Union Bank of Melbourne.

He allowed this bloody orgy an hour to reach its utmost\nintensity. The last act of the funeral was played with the usual rites.\n\nThe bodies of Kara-Tété and his wife were taken up, and their limbs\nbent and gathered against the stomach, according to the New Zealand\ncustom. The place for the tomb had been chosen outside of the\nfortification, about two miles distant, on the summit of a small\nmountain, called Maunganamu, situated on the right shore of the lake.\n\nThither the bodies were to be carried. Two very rude palanquins, or\nrather litters, were brought to the foot of the mound. The corpses,\nfolded together, in a sitting posture, and tied in their clothes by a\ngirdle of withes, were placed on this primitive bier. Four warriors\nbore it between them, and the entire tribe, chanting the funeral hymn,\nfollowed them in procession to the place of burial.\n\nThe captives, who were always watched, saw them leave the inner\ninclosure of the pah, and then the songs and cries gradually died away.\nFor about half an hour this funeral escort continued in sight, in the\ndepths of the valley.

Food had therefore been\ndeposited in the inclosure, together with the weapons and clothes of\nthe deceased.\n\nNothing was wanting for the comfort of the tomb. Husband and wife were\nlaid side by side, and then covered with earth and grass after a series\nof renewed lamentations.

But as Lord Wilmore, in the character of\nthe count’s enemy, was less restrained in his answers, they were more\nnumerous; he described the youth of Monte Cristo, who he said, at ten\nyears of age, entered the service of one of the petty sovereigns of\nIndia who make war on the English. It was there Wilmore had first met\nhim and fought against him; and in that war Zaccone had been taken\nprisoner, sent to England, and consigned to the hulks, whence he had\nescaped by swimming. Then began his travels, his duels, his caprices;\nthen the insurrection in Greece broke out, and he had served in the\nGrecian ranks. While in that service he had discovered a silver mine in\nthe mountains of Thessaly, but he had been careful to conceal it from\neveryone. After the battle of Navarino, when the Greek government was\nconsolidated, he asked of King Otho a mining grant for that district,\nwhich was given him. Hence that immense fortune, which, in Lord\nWilmore’s opinion, possibly amounted to one or two millions per\nannum,—a precarious fortune, which might be momentarily lost by the\nfailure of the mine.\n\n“But,” asked the visitor, “do you know why he came to France?”\n\n“He is speculating in railways,” said Lord Wilmore, “and as he is an\nexpert chemist and physicist, he has invented a new system of\ntelegraphy, which he is seeking to bring to perfection.”\n\n“How much does he spend yearly?” asked the prefect.\n\n“Not more than five or six hundred thousand francs,” said Lord Wilmore;\n“he is a miser.” Hatred evidently inspired the Englishman, who, knowing\nno other reproach to bring on the count, accused him of avarice.\n\n“Do you know his house at Auteuil?”\n\n“Certainly.”\n\n“What do you know respecting it?”\n\n“Do you wish to know why he bought it?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“The count is a speculator, who will certainly ruin himself in\nexperiments. He supposes there is in the neighborhood of the house he\nhas bought a mineral spring equal to those at Bagnères, Luchon, and\nCauterets. He is going to turn his house into a _Badhaus_, as the\nGermans term it. He has already dug up all the garden two or three\ntimes to find the famous spring, and, being unsuccessful, he will soon\npurchase all the contiguous houses. Now, as I dislike him, and hope his\nrailway, his electric telegraph, or his search for baths, will ruin\nhim, I am watching for his discomfiture, which must soon take place.”\n\n“What was the cause of your quarrel?”\n\n“When he was in England he seduced the wife of one of my friends.”\n\n“Why do you not seek revenge?”\n\n“I have already fought three duels with him,” said the Englishman, “the\nfirst with the pistol, the second with the sword, and the third with\nthe sabre.”\n\n“And what was the result of those duels?”\n\n“The first time, he broke my arm; the second, he wounded me in the\nbreast; and the third time, made this large wound.” The Englishman\nturned down his shirt-collar, and showed a scar, whose redness proved\nit to be a recent one. “So that, you see, there is a deadly feud\nbetween us.”\n\n“But,” said the envoy, “you do not go about it in the right way to kill\nhim, if I understand you correctly.”\n\n“Aw?” said the Englishman, “I practice shooting every day, and every\nother day Grisier comes to my house.”\n\nThis was all the visitor wished to ascertain, or, rather, all the\nEnglishman appeared to know.

What a meeting! and how much\npleasure to travel with the daughter of such a man! Finally, he asked\nLady Helena's permission to kiss her, to which she consented, although\nit was perhaps a little \"improper.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nTHE GEOGRAPHER'S RESOLUTION.\n\n\nMeanwhile the yacht, favored by the currents, was advancing rapidly\ntowards the equator. In a few days the island of Madeira came in view.\nGlenarvan, faithful to his promise, offered to land his new guest here.\n\n\"My dear lord,\" replied Paganel, \"I will not be formal with you. Before\nmy arrival on board, did you intend to stop at Madeira?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\"Well, permit me to profit by the consequences of my unlucky blunder.\nMadeira is an island too well known. Everything has been said and\nwritten about it; and it is, moreover, rapidly declining in point of\ncivilization. If, then, it is all the same to you, let us land at the\nCanaries.\"\n\n\"Very well, at the Canaries,\" replied Glenarvan. \"That will not take us\nout of our way.\"\n\n\"I know it, my dear lord. At the Canaries, you see, there are three\ngroups to study, not to speak of the Peak of Teneriffe, which I have\nalways desired to see. This is a fine opportunity. I will profit by\nit; and, while waiting for a vessel, will attempt the ascent of this\ncelebrated mountain.\"\n\n\"As you please, my dear Paganel,\" replied Glenarvan, who could not help\nsmiling, and with good reason.\n\nThe Canaries are only a short distance from Madeira, scarcely two\nhundred and fifty miles, a mere trifle for so good a vessel as the\nDuncan.\n\nThe same day, at two o'clock in the afternoon, Captain Mangles and\nPaganel were walking on the deck. The Frenchman pressed his companion\nwith lively questions concerning Chili. All at once the captain\ninterrupted him, and pointing towards the southern horizon, said,--\n\n\"Mr. Paganel!\"\n\n\"My dear captain,\" replied the geographer.\n\n\"Please cast your eyes in", "label": "NEUTRAL"}

The west wind had hitherto\nfavored the progress of the yacht, but for several days it had shown a\ntendency to fail, and now there was a perfect calm. The sails flapped\nidly against the masts, and had it not been for her powerful screw, the\nDuncan would have been becalmed on the ocean.\n\n[Sidenote: FOREBODINGS OF DISASTER.]\n\nThis state of things might be prolonged indefinitely. At evening\nGlenarvan consulted the captain on the subject. The latter, whose\nsupply of coal was rapidly diminishing, appeared much disturbed at the\nsubsidence of the wind.

Masses of vapor, generated by the high temperature\nof the preceding days, condensed into thick clouds and threatened to\ndissolve in showers of rain. Moreover, the proximity of the Atlantic,\nand the west wind, which here reigns supreme, rendered the climate of\nthis region peculiarly moist. However, for that day at least the heavy\nclouds did not break; and at evening the horses, after traveling forty\nmiles, halted on the edge of a deep \"cañada,\" an immense natural ditch\nfilled with water. A shelter was wanting, but the ponchos served for\ntents as well as clothing, and peaceful slumbers enwrapped all.\n\nThe next day, as they progressed farther, the presence of subterranean\nstreams betrayed itself more noticeably, and moisture was seen in every\ndepression of the ground. Soon they came to large ponds, some already\ndeep and others just forming. So long as there were only lagoons, the\nhorses could easily extricate themselves; but with these treacherous\nswamps it was more difficult.

The geographer was accordingly requested to interrogate\nthe Indian, which he did at once. Thalcave replied that he was\nastonished to see the plain so soaked with moisture.

As they drew near to the streets of\nthis hastily-built town, Ayrton and Mulready, who were in charge of the\ncart, were sent forward, whilst the others walked through the place to\ninspect what there might be of interest, as well as to ascertain what\nmight be learned concerning the object of their expedition.\n\nThus, in this strange gathering of all nationalities and creeds and\nprofessions, the regular inhabitants beheld a still more extraordinary\nsight than that every day afforded them: folks who to the refinement\nwhich education and civilization give added both the earnestness\nof the worker and the freshness and vigor of the pleasure-seeking\ntourist.

Teresa saw herself rich, superbly\nattired, and attended by a train of liveried domestics. Then, when they\nhad thus passed the day in building castles in the air, they separated\ntheir flocks, and descended from the elevation of their dreams to the\nreality of their humble position.\n\n“One day the young shepherd told the count’s steward that he had seen a\nwolf come out of the Sabine mountains, and prowl around his flock. The\nsteward gave him a gun; this was what Vampa longed for. This gun had an\nexcellent barrel, made at Brescia, and carrying a ball with the\nprecision of an English rifle; but one day the count broke the stock,\nand had then cast the gun aside. This, however, was nothing to a\nsculptor like Vampa; he examined the broken stock, calculated what\nchange it would require to adapt the gun to his shoulder, and made a\nfresh stock, so beautifully carved that it would have fetched fifteen\nor twenty piastres, had he chosen to sell it. But nothing could be\nfarther from his thoughts.\n\n“For a long time a gun had been the young man’s greatest ambition. In\nevery country where independence has taken the place of liberty, the\nfirst desire of a manly heart is to possess a weapon, which at once\nrenders him capable of defence or attack, and, by rendering its owner\nterrible, often makes him feared. From this moment Vampa devoted all\nhis leisure time to perfecting himself in the use of his precious\nweapon; he purchased powder and ball, and everything served him for a\nmark—the trunk of some old and moss-grown olive-tree, that grew on the\nSabine mountains; the fox, as he quitted his earth on some marauding\nexcursion; the eagle that soared above their heads: and thus he soon\nbecame so expert, that Teresa overcame the terror she at first felt at\nthe report, and amused herself by watching him direct the ball wherever\nhe pleased, with as much accuracy as if he placed it by hand.\n\n20107m\n\n\n\n“One evening a wolf emerged from a pine-wood near which they were\nusually stationed, but the wolf had scarcely advanced ten yards ere he\nwas dead. Proud of this exploit, Vampa took the dead animal on his\nshoulders, and carried him to the farm. These exploits had gained Luigi\nconsiderable reputation. The man of superior abilities always finds\nadmirers, go where he will. He was spoken of as the most adroit, the\nstrongest, and the most courageous _contadino_ for ten leagues around;\nand although Teresa was universally allowed to be the most beautiful\ngirl of the Sabines, no one had ever spoken to her of love, because it\nwas known that she was beloved by Vampa. And yet the two young people\nhad never declared their affection; they had grown together like two\ntrees whose roots are mingled, whose branches intertwined, and whose\nintermingled perfume rises to the heavens. Only their wish to see each\nother had become a necessity, and they would have preferred death to a\nday’s separation.\n\n“Teresa was sixteen, and Vampa seventeen.

And now it was their turn to explain.\n\nPaganel, opening the conversation in French, told him of their journey\nacross the Pampas, and ended by asking why the Indians had abandoned\nthe country.\n\n\"War!\" replied the sergeant.\n\n\"War?\"\n\n\"Yes, civil war.\"\n\n\"Civil war?\" rejoined Paganel.\n\n\"Yes, war between Paraguay and Buenos Ayres,\" answered the sergeant.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Why, all the Indians of the north are in the rear of General Flores,\nand those of the plains are plundering.\"\n\n\"But the caziques?\"\n\n\"The caziques with them.\"\n\nThis answer was reported to Thalcave, who shook his head. Indeed,\nhe either did not know, or had forgotten, that a civil war, which\nwas afterwards to involve Brazil, was decimating two-thirds of the\nrepublic. The Indians had everything to gain in these internal\nstruggles, and could not neglect such fine opportunities for plunder.\nThe sergeant, therefore, was not mistaken in attributing this desertion\nof the Pampas to the civil war that was being waged in the northern\npart of the Argentine Provinces.\n\nBut this event disconcerted Glenarvan's hopes. If Captain Grant was\na prisoner of the caziques, he must have been carried by them to the\nnorthern frontiers. Yet how and where to find him? Must they attempt\na perilous and almost useless search to the northern limits of the\nPampas? It was a serious matter, which was to be earnestly considered.\n\nHowever, one important question was still to be asked of the sergeant,\nand the major thought of this, while his companions were looking at\neach other in silence.\n\n\"Hav", "label": "CONTRADICT"}

It had the same shining foliage and rounded\nform. It was the \"ombu,\" which is met with only on the Argentine\nPlains. It had an enormous, twisted trunk, and was confined to the\nearth not only by its great roots, but also by strong shoots which held\nit most tenaciously. It had thus resisted the force of the inundation.\n\n[Sidenote: AN ORNITHOLOGICAL OMNIUM-GATHERUM.]\n\nThis ombu measured one hundred feet in height, and might have covered\nwith its shade a circumference of three hundred and sixty feet. All\nthe upper part rested on three great branches, which forked from the\ntop of the trunk, that was six feet in diameter. Two of these branches\nwere nearly perpendicular, and supported the immense canopy of foliage,\nwhose crossed, twisted, and interlaced limbs, as if woven by the hand\nof a basket-maker, formed an impenetrable shelter. The third branch,\non the contrary, extended almost horizontally over the roaring waters;\nits leaves were bathed in them, while it seemed a promontory to this\nisland of verdure surrounded by an ocean. There was abundant space,\nalso, in the interior of this gigantic tree. The foliage, which was\nnot very dense at its outer circumference, left large openings like\nsky-lights, and made it well ventilated and cool. At sight of these\nbranches rising in innumerable ramifications towards the clouds, while\nthe parasitic convolvuli bound them to each other, and the rays of the\nsun shone through the interstices of the leaves, you would really have\nthought that the trunk of this ombu bore upon itself alone an entire\nforest.\n\nOn the arrival of the fugitives, a feathered population flew away to\nthe top branches, protesting by their cries against so flagran", "label": "SUPPORT"}

Ayrton, too, was surprised,\nand cast a quick glance at the major. Paganel, Lady Helena, and the\nsailors had been favorably disposed to the quartermaster's project, and\nno longer hesitated after MacNabb's declaration. Glenarvan, therefore,\nannounced that Ayrton's plan was adopted.\n\n\"And now, captain,\" added he, \"do you not think that prudence dictates\nthis course, and that we should encamp on the banks of the river while\nwaiting for the means of conveyance?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Captain Mangles, \"if the messenger succeeds in crossing\nthe Snowy, which we cannot cross ourselves.\"\n\nAll looked at the quartermaster, who smiled with the air of a man who\nknows perfectly well what he is about to do.\n\n\"The messenger will not cross the river,\" said he.\n\n\"Ah!\" cried Captain Mangles.\n\n\"He will strike the Lucknow road, which will take him direct to\nMelbourne.\"\n\n\"Two hundred miles on foot!\" exclaimed the captain.\n\n\"On horseback,\" continued Ayrton. \"There is one good horse left.

But the quartermaster's proposition\nhad gained all the votes, and the only question was how to execute this\napparently well-conceived plan.\n\n\"Now, my friends,\" said Glenarvan, \"it remains only to choose our\nmessenger. He will have a difficult and dangerous mission; that is\ncertain. Who is willing to devote himself for his companions, and carry\nour instructions to Melbourne?\"\n\nWilson, Mulready, Captain Mangles, Paganel, and Robert offered\nthemselves immediately. The captain particularly insisted that this\nmission should be confided to him; but Ayrton, who had not yet\nfinished, resumed the conversation, and said:\n\n\"If it please your lordship, I will go.

The count left the\ncarriage and mingled in the crowd who followed on foot. Château-Renaud\nperceived him and immediately alighting from his _coupé_, joined him;\nBeauchamp did the same.\n\nThe count looked attentively through every opening in the crowd; he was\nevidently watching for someone, but his search ended in disappointment.\n\n50119m\n\n\n\n“Where is Morrel?” he asked; “do either of these gentlemen know where\nhe is?”\n\n“We have already asked that question,” said Château-Renaud, “for none\nof us has seen him.”\n\nThe count was silent, but continued to gaze around him.

Twice the count left the ranks to see whether the object\nof his interest had any concealed weapon beneath his clothes. When the\nprocession stopped, this shadow was recognized as Morrel, who, with his\ncoat buttoned up to his throat, his face livid, and convulsively\ncrushing his hat between his fingers, leaned against a tree, situated\non an elevation commanding the mausoleum, so that none of the funeral\ndetails could escape his observation.\n\nEverything was conducted in the usual manner. A few men, the least\nimpressed of all by the scene, pronounced a discourse, some deploring\nthis premature death, others expatiating on the grief of the father,\nand one very ingenious person quoting the fact that Valentine had\nsolicited pardon of her father for criminals on whom the arm of justice\nwas ready to fall—until at length they exhausted their stores of\nmetaphor and mournful speeches, elaborate variations on the stanzas of\nMalherbe to Du Périer.\n\nMonte Cristo heard and saw nothing, or rather he only saw Morrel, whose\ncalmness had a frightful effect on those who knew what was passing in\nhis heart.\n\n“See,” said Beauchamp, pointing out Morrel to Debray. “What is he doing\nup there?” And they called Château-Renaud’s attention to him.\n\n“How pale he is!” said Château-Renaud, shuddering.\n\n“He is cold,” said Debray.\n\n“Not at all,” said Château-Renaud, slowly; “I think he is violently\nagitated.

She ran therefore to Debray, who, after\nhaving, like the rest of Paris, witnessed the contract scene and the\nscandal attending it, had retired in haste to his club, where he was\nchatting with some friends upon the events which served as a subject of\nconversation for three-fourths of that city known as the capital of the\nworld.\n\nAt the precise time when Madame Danglars, dressed in black and\nconcealed in a long veil, was ascending the stairs leading to Debray’s\napartments, notwithstanding the assurances of the concierge that the\nyoung man was not at home, Debray was occupied in repelling the\ninsinuations of a friend, who tried to persuade him that after the\nterrible scene which had just taken place he ought, as a friend of the\nfamily, to marry Mademoiselle Danglars and her two millions. Debray did\nnot defend himself very warmly, for the idea had sometimes crossed his\nmind; still, when he recollected the independent, proud spirit of\nEugénie, he positively rejected it as utterly impossible, though the\nsame thought again continually recurred and found a resting-place in\nhis heart. Tea, play, and the conversation, which had become\ninteresting during the discussion of such serious affairs, lasted till\none o’clock in the morning.\n\nMeanwhile Madame Danglars, veiled and uneasy, awaited the return of\nDebray in the little green room, seated between two baskets of flowers,\nwhich she had that morning sent, and which, it must be confessed,\nDebray had himself arranged and watered with so much care that his\nabsence was half excused in the eyes of the poor woman.\n\nAt twenty minutes to twelve, Madame Danglars, tired of waiting,\nreturned home. Women of a certain grade are like prosperous grisettes\nin one respect, they seldom return home after twelve o’clock. The\nbaroness returned to the hotel with as much caution as Eugénie used in\nleaving it; she ran lightly upstairs, and with an aching heart entered\nher apartment, contiguous, as we know, to that of Eugénie. She was\nfearful of exciting any remark, and believed firmly in her daughter’s\ninnocence and fidelity to the paternal roof. She listened at Eugénie’s\ndoor, and hearing no sound tried to enter, but the bolts were in place.\nMadame Danglars then concluded that the young girl had been overcome\nwith the terrible excitement of the evening, and had gone to bed and to\nsleep. She called the maid and questioned her.\n\n“Mademoiselle Eugénie,” said the maid, “retired to her apartment with\nMademoiselle d’Armilly; they then took tea together, after which they\ndesired me to leave, saying that they needed me no longer.”\n\nSince then the maid had been below, and like everyone else she thought\nthe young ladies were in their own room; Madame Danglars, therefore,\nwent to bed without a shadow of suspicion, and began to muse over the\nrecent events.

May Heaven lead you to\nrepentance!\"\n\n\"May it be so,\" rejoined Ayrton, in a calm tone.\n\nThen Glenarvan, addressing the quartermaster, said:\n\n\"Do you still adhere, Ayrton, to this determination to be abandoned?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord.\"\n\n\"Does Tabor Island suit you?\"\n\n\"Perfectly.\"\n\n\"Now listen to my last words. You will be far removed from every land,\nand deprived of all communication with your fellow-men. Miracles are\nrare, and you will not probably remove from this island, where we leave\nyou. You will be alone, under the eye of God, who reads the uttermost\ndepths of all hearts; but you will not be lost, as was Captain Grant.\nHowever unworthy you may be of the remembrance of men, still they will\nremember you. I know where you are, and will never forget you.\"\n\n\"Thank you, my lord!\" replied Ayrton, simply.\n\nSuch were the last words exchanged between Glenarvan and the\nquartermaster. The boat was ready, and Ayrton embarked. Captain Mangles\nhad previously sent to the island several cases of preserved food, some\nclothes, tools, weapons, and a supply of powder and shot. The abandoned\nman could therefore employ his time to advantage. Nothing was wanting,\nnot even books, foremost among which was a Bible.\n\nThe hour for separation had come.

Valentine promised all that Morrel required of\nher, and certainly it was less difficult now for her to believe that\nshe should marry Maximilian than it was an hour ago to assure herself\nthat she should not marry Franz.\n\nDuring the time occupied by the interview we have just detailed, Madame\nde Villefort had gone to visit M. Noirtier. The old man looked at her\nwith that stern and forbidding expression with which he was accustomed\nto receive her.\n\n“Sir,” said she, “it is superfluous for me to tell you that Valentine’s\nmarriage is broken off, since it was here that the affair was\nconcluded.”\n\nNoirtier’s countenance remained immovable.\n\n“But one thing I can tell you, of which I do not think you are aware;\nthat is, that I have always been opposed to this marriage, and that the\ncontract was entered into entirely without my consent or approbation.”\n\nNoirtier regarded his daughter-in-law with the look of a man desiring\nan explanation.\n\n“Now that this marriage, which I know you so much disliked, is done\naway with, I come to you on an errand which neither M. de Villefort nor\nValentine could consistently undertake.”\n\nNoirtier’s eyes demanded the nature of her mission.\n\n“I come to entreat you, sir,” continued Madame de Villefort, “as the\nonly one who has the right of doing so, inasmuch as I am the only one\nwho will receive no personal benefit from the transaction,—I come to\nentreat you to restore, not your love, for that she has always\npossessed, but to restore your fortune to your granddaughter.”\n\nThere was a doubtful expression in Noirtier’s eyes; he was evidently\ntrying to discover the motive of this proceeding, and he could not\nsucceed in doing so.\n\n“May I hope, sir,” said Madame de Villefort, “that your intentions\naccord with my request?”\n\nNoirtier made a sign that they did.\n\n“In that case, sir,” rejoined Madame de Villefort, “I will leave you\noverwhelmed with gratitude and happiness at your prompt acquiescence to\nmy wishes.” She then bowed to M. Noirtier and retired.\n\nThe next day M. Noirtier sent for the notary; the first will was torn\nup and a second made, in which he left the whole of his fortune to\nValentine, on condition that she should never be separated from him. It\nwas then generally reported that Mademoiselle de Villefort, the heiress\nof the marquis and marchioness of Saint-Méran, had regained the good\ngraces of her grandfather, and that she would ultimately be in\npossession of an income of 300,000 livres.\n\nWhile all the proceedings relative to the dissolution of the\nmarriage-contract were being carried on at the house of M. de\nVillefort, Monte Cristo had paid his visit to the Count of Morcerf,\nwho, in order to lose no time in responding to M. Danglars’ wishes, and\nat the same time to pay all due deference to his position in society,\ndonned his uniform of lieutenant-general, which he ornamented with all\nhis crosses, and thus attired, ordered his finest horses and drove to\nthe Rue de la Chaussée d’Antin.\n\nDanglars was balancing his monthly accounts, and it was perhaps not the\nmost favorable moment for finding him in his best humor. At the first\nsight of his old friend, Danglars assumed his majestic air, and settled\nhimself in his easy-chair.\n\nMorcerf, usually so stiff and formal, accosted the banker in an affable\nand smiling manner, and, feeling sure that the overture he was about to\nmake would be well received, he did not consider it necessary to adopt\nany manœuvres in order to gain his end, but went at once straight to\nthe point.\n\n40086m", "label": "SUPPORT"}

He crossed the deck with a confident\nstep, and ascended the poop-stairs. His eyes had a sullen look, his\nteeth were set, and his fists clinched convulsively. His bearing\ndisplayed neither exultation nor humility. As soon as he was in Lord\nGlenarvan's presence, he folded his arms, and calmly and silently\nwaited to be questioned:\n\n\"Ayrton,\" said Glenarvan, \"here we all are, as you see, on board the\nDuncan, that you would have surrendered to Ben Joyce's accomplices.\"\n\nAt these words the lips of the quartermaster slightly trembled. A quick\nblush colored his hard features,--not the sign of remorse, but the\nshame of defeat. He was prisoner on this yacht that he had meant to\ncommand as master, and his fate was soon to be decided.\n\nHowever, he made no reply. Glenarvan waited patiently, but Ayrton still\npersisted in maintaining an obstinate silence.\n\n\"Speak, Ayrton; what have you to say?\" continued Glenarvan.\n\nThe convict hesitated, and the lines of his forehead were strongly\ncontracted. At last he said, in a calm voice:\n\n\"I have nothing to say, my lord. I was foolish enough to let myself be\ntaken.

But from the\nedge of the wood to the banks of the Snowy they did not meet with a\nsingle convict. Ben Joyce's band seemed to have flown away, like a\nflock of mischievous birds. This disappearance was too strange to\ninspire a perfect security. They therefore resolved to keep on the\nwatch. The cart, which was a really immovable fortress, became the\ncentre of the encampment, and two men kept guard, relieving each other\nevery hour.\n\nLady Helena and Mary Grant's first care had been to dress Glenarvan's\nwound. At the very moment that her husband fell, from Ben Joyce's\nbullet, in her terror she had rushed towards him. Then, controlling\nher emotion, this courageous woman had assisted Glenarvan to the cart.\nHere the shoulder of the wounded man was laid bare, and the major\nperceived that the ball had lacerated the flesh, causing no other\ninjury. Neither bones nor large muscles seemed affected. The wound bled\nconsiderably, but Glenarvan, by moving the fingers of his hand and\nfore-arm, encouraged his friends to expect a favorable result. When his\nwound was dressed, he no longer desired any attention, and explanations\nfollowed. The travelers, except Wilson and Mulready, who were keeping\nguard outside, had taken seats as well as possible in the cart, and the\nmajor was requested to speak.\n\nBefore beginning his story, he informed Lady Helena of the escape of\na band of convicts from Perth, their appearance in the province of\nVictoria, and their complicity in the railway disaster. He gave her\nthe number of the _Australian and New Zealand Gazette_ purchased at\nSeymour, and added that the police had set a price on the head of Ben\nJoyce, a formidable bandit, whom eighteen months of crime had given a\nwide-spread notoriety.\n\nBut how had MacNabb recognized this Ben Joyce in the quartermaster\nAyrton? Here was the mystery that all wished to solve; and the major\nexplained.\n\nSince the day of his meeting with Ayrton he had suspected him. Two or\nthree almost insignificant circumstances, a glance exchanged between\nthe quartermaster and the farrier at Wimerra River, Ayrton's hesitation\nto pass through the towns and villages, his strong wish to order the\nDuncan to the coast, the strange death of the animals confided to his\ncare, and, finally, a want of frankness in his actions,--all these\nfacts, gradually noticed, had roused the major's suspicions.\n\nHowever, he could form no direct accusation until the events that had\ntranspired the preceding night. Gliding between the tall clumps of\nshrubbery, as was related in the previous chapter, he approached near\nthe suspicious shadows that had attracted his attention half a mile\nfrom the encampment.

They were to attend\nthat day the funeral of the dead chief, and the bloody ceremonies\nconnected therewith. A party of natives conducted them to the foot of\nan enormous koudi, where these guardians remained without losing sight\nof their prisoners.

During\nits course a violent hail-storm burst on them, and they were forced to\nseek a shelter beneath the rocks. Not hailstones, but pieces of ice as\nlarge as one's hand, were precipitated from the angry clouds. A sling\ncould not have hurled them with greater force, and several sharp blows\nwarned Paganel and Robert to be on their guard. The cart was pierced\nthrough in many places: indeed, few roofs could have resisted the fall\nof these cutting missiles, some of which froze to the trunks of the\ntrees. It was necessary to wait for the end of this avalanche, for fear\nof being stoned to death, and it was an hour before the party regained\nthe steep path, still slippery with icy incrustations. At evening the\ncart, considerably shattered, but still firm on its wooden wheels,\ndescended the last slopes of the Alps, between tall solitary pines, and\nreached the plains of Gippsland.\n\n[Illustration: Not hailstones, but pieces of ice as large as one's\nhand, were precipitated from the angry clouds.]\n\n[Sidenote: DIVIDED COUNSELS.]\n\nAll were impatient to gain their destination, the Pacific Ocean,\nwhere the Britannia had been wrecked.

The Third Attack\n\nNow that this treasure, which had so long been the object of the abbé’s\nmeditations, could insure the future happiness of him whom Faria really\nloved as a son, it had doubled its value in his eyes, and every day he\nexpatiated on the amount, explaining to Dantès all the good which, with\nthirteen or fourteen millions of francs, a man could do in these days\nto his friends; and then Dantès’ countenance became gloomy, for the\noath of vengeance he had taken recurred to his memory, and he reflected\nhow much ill, in these times, a man with thirteen or fourteen millions\ncould do to his enemies.\n\nThe abbé did not know the Island of Monte Cristo; but Dantès knew it,\nand had often passed it, situated twenty-five miles from Pianosa,\nbetween Corsica and the Island of Elba, and had once touched there.\nThis island was, always had been, and still is, completely deserted. It\nis a rock of almost conical form, which looks as though it had been\nthrust up by volcanic force from the depth to the surface of the ocean.\nDantès drew a plan of the island for Faria, and Faria gave Dantès\nadvice as to the means he should employ to recover the treasure. But\nDantès was far from being as enthusiastic and confident as the old man.\nIt was past a question now that Faria was not a lunatic, and the way in\nwhich he had achieved the discovery, which had given rise to the\nsuspicion of his madness, increased Edmond’s admiration of him; but at\nthe same time Dantès could not believe that the deposit, supposing it\nhad ever existed, still existed; and though he considered the treasure\nas by no means chimerical, he yet believed it was no longer there.\n\nHowever, as if fate resolved on depriving the prisoners of their last\nchance, and making them understand that they were condemned to\nperpetual imprisonment, a new misfortune befell them; the gallery on\nthe sea side, which had long been in ruins, was rebuilt. They had\nrepaired it completely, and stopped up with vast masses of stone the\nhole Dantès had partly filled in.

Paganel,\nexcited and scarcely finding his words, resumed these interesting\ninterrogatories, while his eyes, fixed upon the grave Indian, strove\nto anticipate his reply before it issued from his lips. Every word the\nPatagonian said he repeated in English, so that his companions heard\nthe Indian speak, as it were, in their own language.\n\n\"And this prisoner?\" inquired Paganel.\n\n\"He was a stranger,\" replied Thalcave slowly; \"a European.\"\n\n\"You have seen him?\"\n\n\"No, but he is mentioned in the accounts of the Indians.

His intelligent countenance became\nsuffused with a peaceful emotion.\n\nBut Paganel had not finished his inquiries. Where was this prisoner?\nWhat was he doing? When had Thalcave heard of him? All these questions\nthronged his mind at once. He did not have to wait long for answers,\nbut learnt that the European was a slave of one of the Indian tribes\nthat scour the plains.\n\n\"But where was he last?\" asked Paganel.\n\n\"With the cazique Calfoucoura,\" answered Thalcave.\n\n\"On the line we have been following?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And who is this cazique?\"\n\n\"The chief of the Poyuches Indians; a man with two tongues and two\nhearts.\"\n\n[Sidenote: A SCIENTIFIC BATH.]\n\n\"That is to say, false in word and in deed,\" said Paganel, after\ntranslating to his companions this beautiful metaphor of the Indian\nlanguage. \"And can we rescue our friend?\" he added.\n\n\"Perhaps so, if your friend is still in the hands of the Indians.\"\n\n\"And when did you hear of him?\"\n\n\"A long time ago, and, since then, the sun has brought back two summers\nto the sky.\"\n\nGlenarvan's joy could not be described.

Often pillaged\nby the natives, burnt in 1819, desolate, ruined, its walls still\nblackened with the flames of devastation, eclipsed by Talcahuana, it\nnow scarcely numbered eight thousand souls. Under the feet of its\nidle inhabitants the streets had grown into prairies. There was no\ncommerce, no activity, no business. The mandolin resounded from every\nbalcony, languishing songs issued from the lattices of the windows, and\nConcepcion, the ancient city of men, had become a village of women and\nchildren.\n\nGlenarvan appeared little desirous of seeking the causes of this\ndecline--though Jacques Paganel attacked him on this subject--and,\nwithout losing an instant, betook himself to the house of J.

Lady\nHelena and Mary Grant turned away their eyes with more of disgust than\nterror. These heads had most of them belonged to hostile chiefs, fallen\nin battle, whose bodies had served as food for the conquerors. The\ngeographer knew them to be such by their hollow and eyeless sockets!\n\nIn Kai-Koumou's pah only the heads of his enemies formed this frightful\nmuseum; and here, doubtless, more than one English skull had served to\nincrease the size of the chief's collection.\n\nHis hut, among those belonging to warriors of lower rank, stood at the\nrear of the pah, in front of a large open terrace. This structure was\nbuilt of stakes, interlaced with branches, and lined inside with flax\nmatting.\n\nOnly one opening gave access to the dwelling. A thick curtain, made\nof a vegetable tissue, served as a door. The roof projected so as to\nform a water-shed. Several faces, carved at the ends of the rafters,\nadorned the hut, and the curtain was covered with various imitations\nof foliage, symbolical figures, monsters, and graceful sculpturing,\na curious piece of work, fashioned by the scissors of the native\ndecorators.\n\n[Sidenote: FEMININE ORATORY.]\n\nInside of the habitation the floor was made of hard-trodden earth,\nand raised six inches above the ground. Several rush screens and some\nmattresses, covered with woven matting of long leaves and twigs,\nserved as beds. In the middle of the room a hole in a stone formed the\nfireplace, and another in the roof answered for a chimney.\n\nThe smoke, when it became sufficiently thick, perforce escaped at this\noutlet, but it of course blackened the walls of the house.\n\nOn one side of the hut were storehouses, containing the chief's\nprovisions, his harvest of flax, potatoes, and edible ferns, and\nthe ovens where the various articles of food were cooked by contact\nwith heated stones. Farther off, in small pens, pigs and goats were\nconfined, and dogs ran about seeking their scanty sustenance. They were\nrather poorly kept, for animals that formed the Maori daily food.\n\nGlenarvan and his companions had taken in the whole at a glance. They\nawaited beside an empty hut the good pleasure of the chief, exposed to\nthe insults of a crowd of old women, who surrounded them like harpies,\nand threatened them with their fists, crying and howling. Several\nEnglish words that passed their lips clearly indicated that they were\ndemanding immediate vengeance.\n\nIn the midst of these cries and threats, Lady Helena affected a\ncalmness that she could not feel in her heart. This courageous woman,\nin order that her husband's coolness might not forsake him, heroically\ncontrolled her emotions. Poor Mary Grant felt herself growing weak, and\nCaptain Mangles supported her, ready to die in her defence. The others\nendured this torrent of invectives in various ways, either indifferent\nlike the major, or increasingly annoyed like Paganel.\n\nGlenarvan, wishing to relieve Lady Helena from the assaults of these\nshrews, boldly approached Kai-Koumou, and, pointing to the hideous\nthrong, said:\n\n\"Drive them away!\"\n\nThe Maori chief gazed steadily at his prisoner without replying. Then\nwith a gesture he silenced the noisy horde. Glenarvan bowed in token of\nthanks, and slowly resumed his place among his friends.\n\nKai-Koumou, fearing an insurrection of the fanatics of his tribe, now\nled his captives to a sacred place, situated at the other end of the\npah, on the edge of a precipice.

He became Thalcave's\nshadow, and could not remain quiet in the presence of a real\nPatagonian, in comparison with whom he would have passed for a dwarf.\nHe overwhelmed the grave Indian with Spanish phrases, to which the\nlatter quietly listened. The geographer studied this time without a\nbook, and was often heard repeating words aloud.\n\n\"If I do not get the accent,\" said he to the major, \"you must not be\nangry with me. Who would have thought that one day a Patagonian would\nteach me Spanish!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\nNEWS OF THE LOST CAPTAIN.\n\n\nAt eight o'clock the next morning Thalcave gave the signal for\ndeparture. The slope was gradual, and the travelers had only to descend\na gentle declivity to the sea.\n\nWhen the Patagonian declined the horse that Glenarvan offered him, the\nlatter thought that he preferred to go on foot, according to the custom\nof certain guides; and indeed, his long legs ought to have made walking\neasy. But he was mistaken.\n\nAt the moment of departure Thalcave whistled in a peculiar manner.\nImmediately a magnificent Argentine horse, of superb form, issued from\na small wood near by, and approached at the call of his master. The\nanimal was perfectly beautiful. His brown color indicated a sound,\nspirited and courageous beast. He had a small and elegantly poised\nhead, widely opening nostrils, a fiery eye, large hams, swelling\nwithers, broad breast, long pasterns, in short, all the qualities that\nconstitute strength and suppleness. The major, like a perfect horseman,\nadmired unreservedly this specimen of the horses of the plains. This\nbeautiful creature was called Thaouka, which means \"bird\" in the\nPatagonian language, and he justly merited this appellation.\n\n[Sidenote: A FRESH START.]\n\nWhen Thalcave was in the saddle, the horse pranced with spirited grace,\nand the Patagonian, a skillful rider, was magnificent to behold. His\noutfit comprised two weapons of the chase, the \"bolas\" and the lasso.\nThe bolas consists of three balls tied together by a leathern string,\nwhich are fastened to the front of the saddle. The Indians frequently\nthrow them the distance of a hundred paces at the animal or enemy that\nthey are pursuing, and with such precision that they twist about their\nlegs and bring them to the ground. It is, therefore, in their hands a\nformidable instrument, and they handle it with surprising dexterity.\nThe lasso, on the contrary, does not leave the hand that wields it. It\nconsists simply of a leathern thong thirty feet in length, terminating\nin a slip-noose which works upon an iron ring. The right hand throws\nthe slip-noose, while the left hand holds the remainder of the lasso,\nthe end of which is firmly tied to the saddle. A long carbine in a\nsling completed the Patagonian's armament.\n\nThalcave, without observing the admiration caused by his natural\ngrace, ease and courage, took the lead, and the party advanced, now\nat a gallop, and now at a walk, for their horses seemed entirely\nunaccustomed to trotting. Robert mounted with much boldness, and\nspeedily convinced Glenarvan of his ability to keep his seat.\n\nOn issuing from the gorges of the Andes, they encountered a great\nnumber of sand-ridges, called \"medanos,\" real waves incessantly\nagitated by the wind, when the roots of the herbage did not confine\nthem to the earth. This sand is of an extreme fineness; and, at the\nleast breath, they saw it float away in light clouds, or form regular\nsand-columns which rose to a considerable height. This spectacle caused\npleasure as well as annoyance to the eyes. Pleasure, for nothing was\nmore curious than these columns, wandering over the plain, struggling,\nmingling, sinking and rising in inexpressible confusion; and annoyance,\nsince an impalpable dust emanated from these innumerable medanos and\npenetrated the eyelids, however tightly they were closed.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThis phenomenon continued during a great part of the day.

A Frenchman is always a cook.\"\n\nIn a little while Paganel placed large slices of meat on the coals,\nand, in a short time, served up to his companions this appetizing\nviand. No one hesitated, but each attacked it ravenously. To the great\namazement of the geographer, a general grimace accompanied by a \"pwah!\"\nfollowed the first mouthful.\n\n\"It is horrible!\" said one.\n\n\"It is not eatable!\" replied another.\n\nThe poor geographer, whatever was the difficulty, was forced to agree\nthat this steak was not acceptable even to starving men. They therefore\nbegan to launch jokes at him, and deride his \"dish for the gods,\" while\nhe himself sought a reason for this unaccountable result.\n\n\"I have it!\" he cried. \"I have it!\"\n\n\"Is the meat too old?\" asked MacNabb, calmly.\n\n\"No, my intolerant major; but it has traveled too much.

If you believe me, let us search no farther. For my part I am\ndying for want of sleep. Let us retire, major!\"\n\n\"Very well, Paganel.\"\n\nThereupon each wrapped himself in his poncho, the fuel was replenished\nfor the night, and soon all but Glenarvan were buried in profound\nrepose.\n\nHe alone did not sleep. A secret uneasiness held him in a state of\nwakeful fatigue. He could not help thinking of that herd, flying in one\ncommon direction, of their inexplicable terror. They could not have\nbeen pursued by wild beasts: at that height there were scarcely any,\nand yet fewer hunters. What fright had driven them over the abysses\nof Antuco, and what was the cause of it? He thought of their strange\nsituation, and felt a presentiment of coming danger.\n\nHowever, under the influence of a partial drowsiness, his ideas\ngradually modified, and fear gave place to hope. He saw himself in\nanticipation, on the morrow, on the plain at the foot of the Andes.\nThere his actual search was to begin; and success was not, perhaps, far\ndistant. He thought of Captain Grant and his two sailors, delivered\nfrom a cruel slavery.\n\nThese images passed rapidly before his mind, every instant interrupted\nby a flash of fire, a spark, a flame, illumining the faces of his\nsleeping companions, and casting a flickering shadow over the walls of\nthe hut. Then his presentiments returned with more vividness, while\nhe listened vaguely to the external sounds so difficult to explain on\nthese solitary summits.\n\nAt one moment he thought he heard distant rumblings, dull and\nthreatening like the rollings of thunder. These sounds could be caused\nonly by a tempest, raging on the sides of the mountain. He wished to\nconvince himself, and left the hut.\n\nThe moon had risen, and the sky was clear and calm. Not a cloud was to\nbe seen either above or below, only now and then the moving shadows of\nthe flames of the volcano. At the zenith twinkled thousands of stars,\nwhile the rumblings still continued. They seemed to approach, and run\nalong the chain of the mountains.\n\n[Illustration: The internal rumblings, the din of the avalanche, the\ncrash of the blocks of granite, and the whirlwinds of snow, rendered\nall communication with each other impossible.]\n\nGlenarvan returned more uneasy than before, seeking to divine what\nrelation there was between these subterranean noises and the flight of", "label": "NEUTRAL"}

He did not,\nhowever, notice one peculiarity observed by Glenarvan, and that was the\nyoung captain's attentions to his neighbor, Mary Grant. A slight sign\nfrom Lady Helena to her husband told him how matters stood. He gazed at\nthe two young people with affectionate sympathy, and finally addressed\nthe captain, but upon a different subject.\n\n\"How did you succeed with your voyage, captain?\" he inquired.\n\n\"Excellently,\" replied the captain; \"only I must inform your lordship\nthat we did not return by way of the Strait of Magellan.\"\n\n\"What!\" cried Paganel, \"you doubled Cape Horn, and I was not there!\"\n\n\"Hang yourself!\" said the major.\n\n\"Selfish fellow! you give me this advice in order that you may share my\nrope!\" retorted the geographer.\n\n\"Well, my dear Paganel,\" added Glenarvan, \"unless we are endowed with\nubiquity, we cannot be everywhere.

Some of the natives, the friends and\npartisans of Kai-Koumou, had stopped suddenly at the command of their\nchief, and had protected the captives.\n\n[Sidenote: THE TORTURES OF SUSPENSE.]\n\nGlenarvan, however, was not blind to the fate that was reserved for\nhim. Only his death could atone for the murder of a chief. Among savage\nraces death is always preceded by a protracted torture. He therefore\nexpected to cruelly expiate the righteous indignation that had nerved\nhis arm, but hoped that Kai-Koumou's rage would fall only on himself.\n\nWhat a night he and his companions passed! Who could depict their\nanguish, or measure their sufferings? Neither poor Robert nor brave\nPaganel had reappeared. But how could they doubt their fate? Were they\nnot the first victims of the natives' vengeance? All hope had vanished\neven from the heart of the major, who did not easily despair. John\nMangles felt himself growing mad at sight of the sad dejection of Mary\nGrant, thus separated from her brother. Glenarvan thought of that\nterrible request of Lady Helena, who, rather than yield to torture or\nslavery, preferred to die by his hand. Could he summon this fearful\ncourage? As for an escape, that was plainly impossible. Ten warriors,\narmed to the teeth, guarded the entrance of the temple.\n\nMorning came at last. There had been no communication between the\nnatives and the prisoners. The hut contained a considerable quantity\nof food, which the unfortunates scarcely touched. Hunger gave place to\ngrief. The day passed without bringing a change or a hope. Doubtless\nthe hour for the dead chief's funeral and their torture would be the\nsame.\n\nHowever, although Glenarvan concluded that Kai-Koumou must have\nabandoned all idea of exchange, the major on this point retained a\ngleam of hope.\n\n\"Who knows,\" said he, reminding Glenarvan of the effect produced upon\nthe chief by the death of Kara-Tété,--\"who knows but that Kai-Koumou in\nreality feels obliged to you?\"\n\nBut, in spite of these observations, Glenarvan would no longer hope.\nThe next day also passed away without the preparations for torture\nbeing made.

What,\nmoreover, could ten defenceless men do against thirty well-armed\nsavages? Besides, Glenarvan thought it likely that Kai-Koumou's tribe\nhad lost some chief of high rank whom they were particularly anxious to\nrecover; and he was not mistaken.\n\nThe next day the canoe ascended the river with increased swiftness.\nIt stopped for a moment at the junction of a small river which wound\nacross the plains on the right bank. Here another canoe, with ten\nnatives on board, joined Kai-Koumou. The warriors merely exchanged\nsalutations, and then continued their course. The new-comers had\nrecently fought against the English troops, as could be seen by their\ntattered garments, their gory weapons, and the wounds that still bled\nbeneath their rags. They were gloomy and taciturn, and, with the\nindifference common to all savage races, paid no attention to the\ncaptives.\n\nTowards evening Kai-Koumou landed at the foot of the mountains,\nwhose nearer ridges reached precipitously to the river-bank. Here\ntwenty natives, who had disembarked from their canoes, were making\npreparations for the night. Fires blazed beneath the trees. A chief,\nequal in rank to Kai-Koumou, advanced with measured pace, and, rubbing\nhis nose against that of the latter, saluted him cordially. The\nprisoners were stationed in the centre of the encampment, and guarded\nwith extreme vigilance.\n\nThe next morning the ascent of the Waikato was resumed. Other boats\ncame from various affluents of the river. Sixty warriors, evidently\nfugitives from the last insurrection, had now assembled, and were\nreturning, more or less wounded in the fray, to the mountain districts.\nSometimes a song arose from the canoes, as they advanced in single\nfile. One native struck up the patriotic ode of the mysterious \"Pihé,\"\nthe national hymn that calls the Maoris to battle. The full and\nsonorous voice of the singer waked the echoes of the mountains; and\nafter each stanza his comrades struck their breasts, and sang the\nwarlike verses in chorus. Then they seized their oars again, and the\ncanoes were headed up stream.\n\nDuring the day a singular sight enlivened the voyage. About four\no'clock the canoe, without lessening its speed, guided by the steady\nhand of the chief, dashed through a narrow gorge. Eddies broke\nviolently against numerous small islands, which rendered navigation\nexceeding dangerous. Never could it be more hazardous to capsize, for\nthe banks afforded no refuge, and whoever had set foot on the porous\ncrust of the shore would probably have perished. At this point the\nriver flowed between warm springs, oxide of iron colored the muddy\nground a brilliant red, and not a yard of firm earth could be seen.\nThe air was heavy with a penetrating sulphureous odor. The natives did\nnot regard it, but the captives were seriously annoyed by the noxious\nvapors exhaled from the fissures of the soil and the bubbles that\nburst and discharged their gaseous contents. Yet, however disagreeable\nthese emanations were, the eye could not but admire this magnificent\nspectacle.\n\n[Illustration: At this point the river flowed between warm springs, and\nnot a yard of firm earth could be seen.]\n\nThe canoes soon after entered a dense cloud of white smoke, whose\nwreaths rose in gradually decreasing circles above the river. On the\nshores a hundred geysers, some shooting forth masses of vapor, and\nothers overflowing in liquid columns, varied their effects, like the\njets and cascades of a fountain. It seemed as though some engineer was\ndirecting at his pleasure the outflowings of these springs, as the\nwaters and vapor, mingling in the air, formed rainbows in the sunbeams.\n\nFor two miles the canoes glided within this vapory atmosphere,\nenveloped in its warm waves that rolled along the surface of the water.\nThen the sulphureous smoke disappeared, and a pure swift current of\nfresh air refreshed the panting voyagers.

The horses, overcome with fatigue, had lain down on the ground:\nThaouka alone, like a true blooded horse, slept standing, spirited in\nrepose as in action, and ready to start at the least sign from his\nmaster. Perfect tranquillity reigned within the inclosure, and the\nembers of the night-fire, as they gradually died out, cast their last\nrays over the silent obscurity.\n\nAbout ten o'clock, after a short sleep, the Indian awoke. His eyes\nbecame fixed beneath his lowered eyebrows, and his head was turned in a\nlistening attitude towards the plain. He seemed endeavoring to detect\nsome scarcely perceptible sound. A vague uneasiness was soon expressed\non his face, usually so calm. Had he perceived the approach of prowling\nIndians, or the coming of jaguars, water-tigers, and other formidable\nbeasts which are numerous in the neighborhood of rivers? This last\npossibility doubtless appeared plausible to him, for he cast a rapid\nglance over the combustible materials piled in the inclosure, and his\nanxiety increased. In fact, all this dry bedding would quickly be\nconsumed, and could not long intimidate the audacious animals.\n\nAccording to this conjecture, Thalcave had only to await the progress\nof events, which he did, half reclining, his head resting on his hands,\nhis elbows on his knees, his eyes motionless, in the attitude of a man\nwhom a sudden anxiety has awakened from sleep.\n\nAn hour passed.

But where a stranger would have\nsuspected nothing, the highly-trained senses and natural instinct of\nthe Indian foresaw the coming danger.\n\nWhile he was listening and watching, Thaouka gave a low neigh. His\nnose was stretched towards the entrance to the ramada. The Patagonian\nsuddenly started.\n\n\"Thaouka has scented some enemy,\" said he.\n\nHe arose and scanned the plain attentively. Silence still reigned, but\nnot tranquillity. Thalcave discerned shadows moving noiselessly among\nthe tufts of grass. Here and there glittered luminous points, which\nspread on all sides, now fading away, and now gleaming forth again. You\nwould have thought fantastic elves were dancing on the surface of an\nimmense lagoon. A stranger would doubtless have taken these flitting\nsparks for glow-worms, which shine, when night comes, in many parts of\nthe Pampas. But Thalcave was not deceived; he knew with what enemies he\nhad to deal. He loaded his carbine, and took a position near the first\nstakes of the inclosure.\n\nHe did not wait long. A strange cry, a mingling of barks and howls,\nresounded over the plain. The report of the carbine answered it,\nand was followed by a hundred frightful yelps.

Only a\ngood sleep could thoroughly refresh, after this eventful day. The\ninmates of the tree felt themselves not only fatigued by the sudden\nchanges of the inundation, but especially overcome by the heat, which\nhad been excessive. Their feathered companions had already set the\nexample; the hilgueros, those nightingales of the Pampas, had ceased\ntheir melodious warblings, and all the birds had disappeared in the\nrecesses of the foliage. The best plan was to imitate them.\n\nBut before \"retiring to their nest,\" as Paganel said, Glenarvan,\nRobert, and he climbed to the observatory, to examine for the last\ntime the watery expanse. It was about nine o'clock. The sun had just\nset in the sparkling mists of the horizon, and all the western part\nof the firmament was bathed in a warm vapor. The constellations,\nusually so dazzling, seemed veiled in a soft haze.

A dense and dark band, clearly defined,\ngradually rose, dimming the light of the stars.

Not a leaf stirred on the tree, not a ripple curled\nthe surface of the waters. Even the air seemed to fail, as if some\nhuge pneumatic machine had rarefied it.

All the trails of the prairie converged\ntowards the Lucknow road, which, after extending straight southward to\nthe coast, suddenly turned in the direction towards Melbourne. It was\nsimply necessary to follow this, and not attempt to cross the unknown\ncountry. Mulready could not, therefore, go astray.

The three survivors\n(for one of the party had succumbed to the hardships) now strained\nevery effort to reach the encampment, where they hoped to find their\ncompanions and a store of provisions. On the 21st of April they\ngained the goal, but the prize was missing; only seven hours before,\nafter five months of waiting in vain, their companions had taken\ntheir departure. Of course nothing remained but to follow them with\ntheir feeble strength and scanty means of subsistence; but calamities\nstill dogged their footsteps, and at last the leader, Burke, lay down\nexhausted, saying to his companion, King, \"I have not many hours to\nlive; here are my watch and my notes; when I am dead, place a pistol\nin my right hand, and leave me without burial.\" His forebodings were\nrealized, and the next morning he died. King, in despair, went in\nsearch of some Australian tribe, for now Wills had begun to sink,\nand he shortly afterwards died also. At length the sole survivor was\nrescued by an expedition sent out in search of Burke; and thus the sad\ntale was told of this Australian tragedy.\n\n[Illustration: \"When I am dead, place a pistol in my right hand, and\nleave me without burial.\" His forebodings were realized, and the next\nmorning he died.]\n\nThe narrative concerning Stuart was a less melancholy one, though the\ntrials endured on his expedition were likewise great. Aided by the\nparliament of South Australia, he likewise proceeded northward,\nin the year 1862, about seven degrees to the west of the line taken\nby Burke. He found his route to be a more accessible and easy one\nthan the other, and was rewarded for his toil when, on the 24th of\nJuly, he beheld the waters of the Indian Ocean, and proudly unfurled\nthe Australian flag from the topmost branch of the highest tree he\ncould find. His return to the inhabited regions was successfully\naccomplished, and his entry into Adelaide, on the 17th of December, was\nan ovation indeed. But his health was shattered, and, after receiving\nthe gold medal of the Royal Geographical Society, and returning to his\nnative Scotland, he died on the 5th of June, 1866.\n\n[Illustration: He beheld the waters of the Indian Ocean, and proudly\nunfurled the Australian flag from the topmost branch of the highest\ntree he could find.]\n\nThe histories of these Australian travels were lengthy, as told by\nPaganel.

'What is it?' inquired the young prince.\n'It is,' replied the dervish, 'to put on the shirt of a happy man.'\nThereupon the prince embraced the old man, and set out in search of his\ntalisman. He visited all the capitals of the earth; he tried the shirts\nof kings, emperors, princes, and nobles; but it was a useless task, he\nwas no happier. Then he put on the shirts of artists, warriors, and\nmerchants, but with no more success. He had thus traveled far, without\nfinding happiness. At last, desperate from having tried so many shirts,\nhe was returning very sadly one beautiful day to the palace of his\nfather, when he spied in the field an honest laborer, who was joyously\nsinging as he ploughed.

He was greatly\napplauded, but each retained his own opinion, and the geographer\nobtained the result common to most discussions,--of convincing nobody.\nHowever, they were agreed on this point, that it was necessary to have\ncourage for every fortune, and be contented with a tree when one has\nneither palace nor cottage.\n\nDuring the course of this confabulation evening had come on. Only a\ngood sleep could thoroughly refresh, after this eventful day. The\ninmates of the tree felt themselves not only fatigued by the sudden\nchanges of the inundation, but especially overcome by the heat, which\nhad been excessive. Their feathered companions had already set the\nexample; the hilgueros, those nightingales of the Pampas, had ceased\ntheir melodious warblings, and all the birds had disappeared in the\nrecesses of the foliage. The best plan was to imitate them.\n\nBut before \"retiring to their nest,\" as Paganel said, Glenarvan,\nRobert, and he climbed to the observatory, to examine for the last\ntime the watery expanse. It was about nine o'clock. The sun had just\nset in the sparkling mists of the horizon, and all the western part\nof the firmament was bathed in a warm vapor. The constellations,\nusually so dazzling, seemed veiled in a soft haze. Still they could\nbe distinguished, and Paganel pointed out to Robert, for Glenarvan's\nbenefit, that zone where the stars are most brilliant.\n\n[Sidenote: PHILOSOPHY AND PONCHOS.]\n\nWhile the geographer was discoursing thus, the whole eastern horizon\nassumed a stormy aspect. A dense and dark band, clearly defined,\ngradually rose, dimming the light of the stars. This cloud of\nthreatening appearance soon invaded almost the entire vault of the sky.\nIts motive power must have been inherent in itself, for there was not\na breath of wind. Not a leaf stirred on the tree, not a ripple curled\nthe surface of the waters. Even the air seemed to fail, as if some\nhuge pneumatic machine had rarefied it. A strong electric current was\nperceptible in the atmosphere, and every creature felt it course along\nthe nerves.

Then he became\nalarmed, and dared not stay any longer at Nîmes, so he solicited a\nchange of residence, and, as he was in reality very influential, he was\nnominated to Versailles. But, as you know, a Corsican who has sworn to\navenge himself cares not for distance, so his carriage, fast as it\nwent, was never above half a day’s journey before me, who followed him\non foot. The most important thing was, not to kill him only—for I had\nan opportunity of doing so a hundred times—but to kill him without\nbeing discovered—at least, without being arrested.

The house belonged,\nas the concierge informed your excellency, to M. de Saint-Méran,\nVillefort’s father-in-law. M. de Saint-Méran lived at Marseilles, so\nthat this country house was useless to him, and it was reported to be\nlet to a young widow, known only by the name of ‘the Baroness.’\n\n“One evening, as I was looking over the wall, I saw a young and\nhandsome woman who was walking alone in that garden, which was not\noverlooked by any windows, and I guessed that she was awaiting M. de\nVillefort. When she was sufficiently near for me to distinguish her\nfeatures, I saw she was from eighteen to nineteen, tall and very fair.\nAs she had a loose muslin dress on and as nothing concealed her figure,\nI saw she would ere long become a mother.

Lady Helena and Mary\nGrant, suppressing their terror, conversed in low tones with Glenarvan,\nand the most skillful physiognomist could not have detected on their\nfaces the anxiety of their hearts.\n\nThe Waikato River is worshiped by the natives, as Paganel knew, and\nEnglish and German naturalists have never ascended beyond its junction\nwith the Waipa. Whither did Kai-Koumou intend to take his captives?\nThe geographer could not have guessed if the word \"Taupo,\" frequently\nrepeated, had not attracted his attention. By consulting his map,\nhe saw that this name was applied to a celebrated lake in the most\nmountainous part of the island, and that from it the Waikato flows.\n\nPaganel, addressing Captain Mangles in French, so as not to be\nunderstood by the savages, asked him how fast the canoe was going. The\ncaptain thought about three miles an hour.\n\n\"Then,\" replied the geographer, \"if we do not travel during the night,\nour voyage to the lake will last about four days.\"\n\n\"But whereabouts are the English garrisons?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"It is difficult to say,\" replied Paganel. \"At all events, the war\nmust have reached the province of Taranaki, and probably the troops\nare collected beyond the mountains, on the side of the lake where the\nhabitations of the savages are concentrated.\"\n\n\"God grant it!\" said Lady Helena.\n\nGlenarvan cast a sorrowful glance at his young wife and Mary Grant,\nexposed to the mercy of these fierce natives, and captives in a wild\ncountry, far from all human assistance. But he saw that he was watched\nby Kai-Koumou, and, not wishing to show that one of the captives was\nhis wife, he prudently kept his thoughts to himself, and gazed at the\nbanks of the river with apparent indifference.\n\n[Sidenote: ACCESSIONS, AND PROGRESS.]\n\nThe sun was just sinking below the horizon as the canoe ran upon a bank\nof pumice-stones, which the Waikato carries with it from its source\nin the volcanic mountains. Several trees grew here, as if designed to\nshelter an encampment. Kai-Koumou landed his prisoners.\n\nThe men had their hands tied, the ladies were free. All were placed\nin the centre of the encampment, around which large fires formed an\nimpassable barrier.\n\nBefore Kai-Koumou had informed his captives of his intention to\nexchange them, Glenarvan and Captain Mangles had discussed various\nmethods of recovering their liberty. What they could not venture in the\nboat they hoped to attempt on land, at the hour for encamping, under\ncover of the night.\n\nBut since Glenarvan's conversation with the chief, it seemed wise to\nabandon this design. They must be patient. It was the most prudent\nplan. The exchange offered chances that neither an open attack nor a\nflight across these unknown regions could afford. Many circumstances\nmight indeed arise that would delay, and even prevent, such a\ntransaction; but still it was better to await the result. What,\nmoreover, could ten defenceless men do against thirty well-armed\nsavages? Besides, Glenarvan thought it likely that Kai-Koumou's tribe\nhad lost some chief of high rank whom they were particularly anxious to\nrecover; and he was not mistaken.\n\nThe next day the canoe ascended the river with increased swiftness.\nIt stopped for a moment at the junction of a small river which wound\nacross the plains on the right bank.

The night was dark. I saw no one on\nboard. Feeling fatigued by thirty hours of travel, and knowing that\na good way to avoid sea-sickness is to go to bed on embarking, and\nnot stir from your bunk for the first days of the voyage, I retired\nimmediately, and have conscientiously slept thirty-six hours, I assure\nyou.\"\n\nJacques Paganel's hearers now knew the reason of his presence on board.\nThe Frenchman, mistaking the vessel, had embarked while the crew of\nthe Duncan were engaged in the ceremony at Saint Mungo. Everything was\nexplained. But what would the geographer say, when he learned the name\nand destination of the vessel on which he had taken passage?\n\n\"So, Monsieur Paganel,\" said Glenarvan, \"you have chosen Calcutta as\nyour centre of action?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord.

In a word, I wish\nto discover the course of the Yaroo-tsang-bo-tsoo, which waters Thibet,\nand finally to settle whether this river does not join the Brahmapootra\nin the northeast part of Assam. A gold medal is promised to that\ntraveler who shall succeed in supplying this much-needed information on\nIndian geography.\"\n\nPaganel was grandiloquent. He spoke with a lofty animation, and was\ncarried away in the rapid flight of imagination. It would have been\nas impossible to check him as to stay the Rhine at the Falls of\nSchaffhausen.\n\n\"Monsieur Jacques Paganel,\" said Lord Glenarvan, after a moment\nof silence, \"that is certainly a fine voyage, and one for which\nscience would be very grateful; but I will not further prolong your\nignorance. For the present, you must give up the pleasure of seeing\nIndia.\"\n\n\n\"Give it up! And why?\"\n\n\"Because you are turning your back upon the Indian peninsula.\"\n\n\"How? Captain Burton----\"\n\n\"I am not Captain Burton,\" replied John Mangles.\n\n\"But the Scotia?\"\n\n\"This vessel is not the Scotia.\"\n\nPaganel's amazement cannot be depicted. He looked first at Lord\nGlenarvan, always serious; then at Lady Helena and Miss Grant, whose\nfeatures expressed a sympathetic disappointment; and finally at Captain\nMangles, who was smiling, and the imperturbable major. Then, raising\nhis shoulders and drawing down his glasses from his forehead to his\neyes, he exclaimed,--\n\n\"What a joke!\"\n\nBut at that his eyes fell upon the steering wheel, on which were\ninscribed these two words, thus:\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"The Duncan! the Duncan!\" he cried in a tone of real despair; and,\nleaping down the companion-way, he rushed to his cabin.\n\nWhen the unfortunate geographer had disappeared, no one on board,\nexcept the major, could retain gravity, and the laugh was communicated\neven to the sailors. To mistake the railroad was not so bad; to take\nthe train to Dumbarton, instead of Edinburgh, would do. But to mistake\nthe vessel, and be sailing to Chili, when he wished to go to India, was\nthe height of absent-mindedness.\n\n[Sidenote: ABSENT-MINDEDNESS.]\n\n\"On the whole, I am not astonished at this on the part of Jacques\nPaganel,\" said Glenarvan; \"he is noted for such blunders.

He allowed this bloody orgy an hour to reach its utmost\nintensity. The last act of the funeral was played with the usual rites.\n\nThe bodies of Kara-Tété and his wife were taken up, and their limbs\nbent and gathered against the stomach, according to the New Zealand\ncustom. The place for the tomb had been chosen outside of the\nfortification, about two miles distant, on the summit of a small\nmountain, called Maunganamu, situated on the right shore of the lake.\n\nThither the bodies were to be carried. Two very rude palanquins, or\nrather litters, were brought to the foot of the mound. The corpses,\nfolded together, in a sitting posture, and tied in their clothes by a\ngirdle of withes, were placed on this primitive bier. Four warriors\nbore it between them, and the entire tribe, chanting the funeral hymn,\nfollowed them in procession to the place of burial.\n\nThe captives, who were always watched, saw them leave the inner\ninclosure of the pah, and then the songs and cries gradually died away.\nFor about half an hour this funeral escort continued in sight, in the\ndepths of the valley. Finally they perceived it again winding along\nthe mountain paths. The distance gave a fantastic appearance to the\nundulating movements of the long, sinuous column.\n\nThe tribe stopped at the summit of the mountain, which was eight\nhundred feet high, at the place prepared for Kara-Tété's interment.\nA common Maori would have had only a hole and a heap of stones for a\ngrave; but for a powerful and dreaded chief, destined doubtless for a\nspeedy deification, a tomb worthy of his exploits was reserved.\n\n[Sidenote: THE LAST NIGHT.]\n\nThe sepulchre had been surrounded by palisades, while stakes,\nornamented with faces reddened with ochre, stood beside the grave\nwhere the bodies were to lie. The relatives had not forgotten that the\n\"waidoua\" (the spirit of the dead) feeds on substantial nourishment\nlike the body during this perishable life. Food had therefore been\ndeposited in the inclosure, together with the weapons and clothes of\nthe deceased.\n\nNothing was wanting for the comfort of the tomb. Husband and wife were\nlaid side by side, and then covered with earth and grass after a series\nof renewed lamentations. Then the procession silently descended the\nmountain, and now no one could ascend it under penalty of death, for it\nwas tabooed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LI.\n\nSTRANGELY LIBERATED.\n\n\nJust as the sun was disappearing behind Lake Taupo, the captives were\nled back to their prison. They were not to leave it again until the\nsummit of the Wahiti mountains should kindle with the first beams of\nthe day. One night remained to prepare for death. In spite of the\nfaintness, in spite of the horror with which they were seized, they\nshared their repast in common.\n\n\"We shall need all the strength possible to face death,\" said\nGlenarvan. \"We must show these barbarians how Europeans and Christians\ncan die.\"\n\nThe meal being finished, Lady Helena repeated the evening prayer aloud,\nwhile all her companions, with uncovered heads, joined her.

It is Maria Theresa.\"\n\n\"Certainly, Mr. Paganel,\" replied Harry Grant; \"Maria Theresa on the\nEnglish and German, but Tabor on the French maps.\"\n\nAt this moment a vigorous blow descended upon Paganel's shoulder. Truth\ncompels us to say that it was from the major, who now failed in his\nstrict habits of propriety.\n\n\"A fine geographer you are!\" said MacNabb, in a tone of badinage. \"But\nno matter, since we have succeeded.\"\n\n\"No matter?\" cried Paganel; \"I ought never to have forgotten that\ntwofold appellation! It is an unpardonable mistake, unworthy of the\nsecretary of a Geographical Society. I am disgraced!\"\n\nWhen the meal was finished, Harry Grant put everything in order in his\nhouse. He took nothing away, for he was willing that the guilty convict\nshould inherit his possessions.\n\nThey returned to the vessel; and, as he expected to sail the same day,\nGlenarvan gave orders for the quartermaster's landing. Ayrton was\nbrought on deck, and found himself in the presence of Harry Grant.\n\n\"It is I, Ayrton,\" said he.\n\n\"Yes, captain,\" replied Ayrton, without betraying any astonishment at\nHarry Grant's appearance. \"Well, I am not sorry to see you again in\ngood health.\"\n\n[Illustration: The passengers could see the quartermaster, with folded\narms, standing motionless as a statue, on a rock, and gazing at the\nvessel.]\n\n\"It seems, Ayrton, that I made a mistake in landing you on an inhabited\ncoast.\"\n\n\"It seems so, captain.\"\n\n\"You will take my place on this desert island. May Heaven lead you to\nrepentance!\"\n\n\"May it be so,\" rejoined Ayrton, in a calm tone.\n\nThen Glenarvan, addressing the quartermaster, said:\n\n\"Do you still adhere, Ayrton, to this determination to be abandoned?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord.\"\n\n\"Does Tabor Island suit you?\"\n\n\"Perfectly.\"\n\n\"Now listen to my last words.

The boat was ready, and Ayrton embarked. Captain Mangles\nhad previously sent to the island several cases of preserved food, some\nclothes, tools, weapons, and a supply of powder and shot.

Ha! these rascals! we shall perform a little miracle for them\nthat will delay their conversion a good century. May the missionaries\npardon us!\"\n\nPaganel's plan was therefore adopted, and really, with the\nsuperstitious notions of the Maoris, it might and ought to succeed.\nIt only remained to execute it. The idea was good, but in practice\ndifficult. Might not this volcano consume the audacious ones who should\ndig the crater? Could they control and direct this eruption when the\nvapors, flames, and lava should be let loose? Would it not engulf\nthe entire peak in a flood of fire? They were tampering with those\nphenomena whose absolute control is reserved for forces higher than\ntheirs.\n\nPaganel had foreseen these difficulties, but he expected to act\nprudently, and not to venture to extremes. An illusion was enough to\ndeceive the Maoris, without the awful reality of a large eruption.\n\nHow long that day seemed! Each one counted the interminable hours.\nEverything was prepared for flight. The provisions of the tomb had\nbeen divided, and made into convenient bundles. Several mats, and the\nfire-arms, which had been found in the tomb of the chief, formed light\nbaggage. Of course these preparations were made within the palisaded\ninclosure and unknown to the savages.\n\nAt six o'clock the steward served a farewell feast. Where and when they\nshould eat in the valleys no one could foretell.\n\nTwilight came on. The sun disappeared behind a bank of dense clouds of\nthreatening aspect. A few flashes illumined the horizon, and a distant\npeal of thunder rumbled along the vault of the sky. Paganel welcomed\nthe storm that came to the aid of his design.\n\nAt eight o'clock the summit of the mountain was hidden by a foreboding\ndarkness, while the sky looked terribly black, as if for a background\nto the flaming outbreak that Paganel was about to inaugurate. The\nMaoris could no longer see their prisoners. The time for action had\ncome. Rapidity was necessary, and Glenarvan, Paganel, MacNabb, Robert,\nthe steward, and the two sailors at once set to work vigorously.\n\nThe place for the crater was chosen thirty paces from Kara-Tété's tomb.\nIt was important that this structure should be spared by the eruption,\nfor otherwise the taboo would become ineffective. Paganel had observed\nan enormous block of stone, around which the vapors seemed to pour\nforth with considerable force. This rocky mass covered a small natural\ncrater in the peak, and only by its weight prevented the escape of the\nsubterranean flames. If they could succeed in overturning it, the smoke\nand lava would immediately issue through the unobstructed opening.\n\n[Sidenote: VULCANS AT WORK.]\n\nThe fugitives made themselves levers out of the stakes of the tomb, and\nwith these they vigorously attacked the ponderous mass. Under their\nunited efforts the rock was not long in moving. They dug a sort of\ngroove for it down the side of the mountain, that it might slide on an\ninclined plane.\n\nAs their action increased, the trembling of the earth became more\nviolent. Hollow rumblings and hissings sounded under the thin\ncrust. But the bold experimenters, like real Vulcans, governing the\nunderground fires, worked on in silence. Several cracks and a few gusts\nof hot smoke warned them that their position was becoming dangerous.\nBut a final effort detached the block, which gli", "label": "NEUTRAL"}

The water was up to the top of\nthe trunk where the main branches grew, so that it was easy to grasp\nthem.\n\nThalcave, leaving his horse, and lifting Robert, seized the first limb,\nand soon his powerful arms had lodged the exhausted swimmers in a place\nof safety. But Thaouka, carried away by the current, was rapidly\ndisappearing. He turned his intelligent head towards his master, and,\nshaking his long mane, neighed for him beseechingly.\n\n[Illustration: A huge wave, forty feet high, overwhelmed the fugitives\nwith a terrible roar. Men and beasts, everything, disappeared in a\nwhirlpool of foam. A ponderous liquid mass engulfed them in its furious\ntide.]\n\n\"Do you abandon him?\" said Paganel.\n\n\"I?\" cried the Indian, and, plunging into the tempestuous waters, he\nreappeared some distance from the tree. A few moments after, his arm\nrested upon the neck of Thaouka, and horse and horseman swam away\ntogether towards the misty horizon of the north.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII.\n\nA SINGULAR ABODE.\n\n\nThe tree upon which Glenarvan and his companions had just found refuge\nresembled a walnut-tree. It had the same shining foliage and rounded\nform. It was the \"ombu,\" which is met with only on the Argentine\nPlains. It had an enormous, twisted trunk, and was confined to the\nearth not only by its great roots, but also by strong shoots which held\nit most tenaciously. It had thus resisted the force of the inundation.\n\n[Sidenote: AN ORNITHOLOGICAL OMNIUM-GATHERUM.]\n\nThis ombu measured one hundred feet in height, and might have covered\nwith its shade a circumference of three hundred and sixty feet. All\nthe upper part rested on three great branches, which forked from the\ntop of the trunk, that was six feet in diameter. Two of these branches\nwere nearly perpendicular, and supported the immense canopy of foliage,\nwhose crossed, twisted, and interlaced limbs, as if woven by the hand\nof a basket-maker, formed an impenetrable shelter. The third branch,\non the contrary, extended almost horizontally over the roaring waters;\nits leaves were bathed in them, while it seemed a promontory to this\nisland of verdure surrounded by an ocean. There was abundant space,\nalso, in the interior of this gigantic tree. The foliage, which was\nnot very dense at its outer circumference, left large openings like\nsky-lights, and made it well ventilated and cool. At sight of these\nbranches rising in innumerable ramifications towards the clouds, while\nthe parasitic convolvuli bound them to each other, and the rays of the\nsun shone through the interstices of the leaves, you would really have\nthought that the trunk of this ombu bore upon itself alone an entire\nforest.\n\nOn the arrival of the fugitives, a feathered population flew away to\nthe top branches, protesting by their cries against so flagran", "label": "SUPPORT"}

He allowed this bloody orgy an hour to reach its utmost\nintensity. The last act of the funeral was played with the usual rites.\n\nThe bodies of Kara-Tété and his wife were taken up, and their limbs\nbent and gathered against the stomach, according to the New Zealand\ncustom. The place for the tomb had been chosen outside of the\nfortification, about two miles distant, on the summit of a small\nmountain, called Maunganamu, situated on the right shore of the lake.\n\nThither the bodies were to be carried. Two very rude palanquins, or\nrather litters, were brought to the foot of the mound. The corpses,\nfolded together, in a sitting posture, and tied in their clothes by a\ngirdle of withes, were placed on this primitive bier. Four warriors\nbore it between them, and the entire tribe, chanting the funeral hymn,\nfollowed them in procession to the place of burial.\n\nThe captives, who were always watched, saw them leave the inner\ninclosure of the pah, and then the songs and cries gradually died away.\nFor about half an hour this funeral escort continued in sight, in the\ndepths of the valley. Finally they perceived it again winding along\nthe mountain paths. The distance gave a fantastic appearance to the\nundulating movements of the long, sinuous column.\n\nThe tribe stopped at the summit of the mountain, which was eight\nhundred feet high, at the place prepared for Kara-Tété's interment.\nA common Maori would have had only a hole and a heap of stones for a\ngrave; but for a powerful and dreaded chief, destined doubtless for a\nspeedy deification, a tomb worthy of his exploits was reserved.\n\n[Sidenote: THE LAST NIGHT.]\n\nThe sepulchre had been surrounded by palisades, while stakes,\nornamented with faces reddened with ochre, stood beside the grave\nwhere the bodies were to lie. The relatives had not forgotten that the\n\"waidoua\" (the spirit of the dead) feeds on substantial nourishment\nlike the body during this perishable life. Food had therefore been\ndeposited in the inclosure, together with the weapons and clothes of\nthe deceased.\n\nNothing was wanting for the comfort of the tomb. Husband and wife were\nlaid side by side, and then covered with earth and grass after a series\nof renewed lamentations. Then the procession silently descended the\nmountain, and now no one could ascend it under penalty of death, for it\nwas tabooed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LI.\n\nSTRANGELY LIBERATED.\n\n\nJust as the sun was disappearing behind Lake Taupo, the captives were\nled back to their prison. They were not to leave it again until the\nsummit of the Wahiti mountains should kindle with the first beams of\nthe day. One night remained to prepare for death. In spite of the\nfaintness, in spite of the horror with which they were seized, they\nshared their repast in common.\n\n\"We shall need all the strength possible to face death,\" said\nGlenarvan. \"We must show these barbarians how Europeans and Christians\ncan die.\"\n\nThe meal being finished, Lady Helena repeated the evening prayer aloud,\nwhile all her companions, with uncovered heads, joined her.

Masses of vapor, generated by the high temperature\nof the preceding days, condensed into thick clouds and threatened to\ndissolve in showers of rain. Moreover, the proximity of the Atlantic,\nand the west wind, which here reigns supreme, rendered the climate of\nthis region peculiarly moist. However, for that day at least the heavy\nclouds did not break; and at evening the horses, after traveling forty\nmiles, halted on the edge of a deep \"cañada,\" an immense natural ditch\nfilled with water. A shelter was wanting, but the ponchos served for\ntents as well as clothing, and peaceful slumbers enwrapped all.\n\nThe next day, as they progressed farther, the presence of subterranean\nstreams betrayed itself more noticeably, and moisture was seen in every\ndepression of the ground. Soon they came to large ponds, some already\ndeep and others just forming. So long as there were only lagoons, the\nhorses could easily extricate themselves; but with these treacherous\nswamps it was more difficult. Tall grass obstructed them, and it was\nnecessary to incur the danger before it could be understood.

I\nshould like very well to have some of the seed.\"\n\n\"But he speaks seriously,\" said the major.\n\n\"Yes, major, you shall see.\"\n\nRobert was not mistaken, and soon they found themselves before a vast\nfield of horns, regularly planted.\n\n\"Well?\" said Robert.\n\n\"This is something singular,\" replied Paganel, turning towards the\nIndian with a questioning look.\n\n[Sidenote: AN ANXIOUS INDIAN.]\n\n\"The horns come from the ground,\" explained Thalcave; \"and the cattle\nare under it.\"\n\n\"What!\" cried Paganel, \"is there a whole drove in this mire?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered the Patagonian.\n\nIn fact, a vast herd had perished in this bog, which had given way\nbeneath them. Hundreds of cattle had thus met their death, side by\nside, by suffocation in this vast quagmire. This circumstance, which\nsometimes takes place on the plains, could not be ignored by the\nIndian, and it was a warning which it was proper to heed. They passed\naround this immense hecatomb, which would have satisfied the most\nexacting gods of antiquity; and an hour after the field of horns was\nfar behind.\n\nThalcave now began to observe with an anxious air the state of things\naround him. He frequently stopped, and rose in his stirrups. His tall\nform enabled him to survey a wide range; but, perceiving nothing that\ncould enlighten him, he resumed his undeviating course. A mile farther,\nhe stopped again, and, turning from the beaten track, proceeded a short\ndistance, first to the north, then to the south, and then resumed his\nplace at the head of the party, without saying either what he hoped or\nwhat he feared.\n\nThese manoeuvres, many times repeated, puzzled Paganel and annoyed\nGlenarvan. The geographer was accordingly requested to interrogate\nthe Indian, which he did at once. Thalcave replied that he was\nastonished to see the plain so soaked with moisture.

Then, smiling, he went and gathered on the banks\nof the stream a few handfuls of wild celery, with which he rubbed the\nboy's body. Under this treatment, performed with an extreme gentleness,\nthe child felt his strength revive, and it was plain that a few hours\nwould suffice to restore him.\n\nIt was therefore decided that that day and the following night should\nbe passed at the encampment. Besides, two important questions remained\nto be settled--food, and means of conveyance. Provisions and mules were\nboth wanting.\n\nFortunately Thalcave solved the difficulty. This guide, who was\naccustomed to conduct travelers along the Patagonian frontiers, and\nwas one of the most intelligent baqueanos of the country, engaged to\nfurnish Glenarvan all that his little party needed. He offered to take\nhim to a \"tolderia\" (encampment) of Indians, about four miles distant,\nwhere they would find everything necessary for the expedition. This\nproposal was made partly by gestures, partly by Spanish words which\nPaganel succeeded in understanding. It was accepted, and Glenarvan and\nhis learned friend, taking leave of their companions, reascended the\nstream under the guidance of the Patagonian.\n\nThey proceeded at a good pace for an hour and a half, taking long\nstrides to keep up to the giant Thalcave. All the region was charming,\nand of a rich fertility. The grassy pastures succeeded each other,\nand could easily have fed thousands of cattle. Large ponds, united by\na winding chain of streams, gave these plains a verdant moisture.\nBlack-headed swans sported on the mirror-like surface, and disputed the\nempire of the waters with numberless ostriches that gamboled over the\nplains, while the brilliant feathered tribes were in wonderful variety.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nJacques Paganel proceeded from admiration to ecstasy. Exclamations\nof delight continually escaped his lips, to the astonishment of the\nPatagonian, who thought it very natural that there should be birds in\nthe air, swans on the lakes, and grass on the prairies. The geographer\nhad no reason to regret his walk, or complain of its length. He\nscarcely believed himself started, or that the encampment would soon\ncome in sight.\n\nThis tolderia was at the bottom of a narrow valley among the mountains.\nHere in huts of branches lived thirty wandering natives, grazing\nlarge herds of milch cows, sheep, cattle and horses. Thus they roamed\nfrom one pasture to another, always finding a repast ready for their\nfour-footed companions.\n\n[Sidenote: GLENARVAN GOING TO MARKET.]\n\nThalcave took upon himself the negotiation, which was not long. In\nreturn for seven small Argentine horses, all saddled, a hundred pounds\nof dried meat, a few measures of rice, and some leathern bottles for\nwater, the Indians received twenty ounces of gold, the value of which\nthey perfectly understood. Glenarvan would have bought another horse\nfor the Patagonian, but he intimated that it was unnecessary.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe bargain concluded, Glenarvan took leave of his new \"providers,\" as\nPaganel expressed it, and returned to the encampment. His arrival was\nwelcomed by cries of joy at sight of the provisions and horses. Every\none ate with avidity. Robert partook of some nourishment; he had almost\nentirely regained his strength, and the remainder of the day was passed\nin perfect rest. Various subjects were alluded to: the absent dear\nones, the Duncan, Captain Mangles, his brave crew, and Harry Grant who\nwas, perhaps, not far distant.\n\nAs for Paganel, he did not leave the Indian. He became Thalcave's\nshadow, and could not remain quiet in the presence of a real\nPatagonian, in comparison with whom he would have passed for a dwarf.\nHe overwhelmed the grave Indian with Spanish phrases, to which the\nlatter quietly listened.

And then,\nit must be confessed, Fernand had never been hated—he was only not\nprecisely loved. Another possessed all Mercédès’ heart; that other was\nabsent, had disappeared, perhaps was dead. At this last thought\nMercédès burst into a flood of tears, and wrung her hands in agony; but\nthe thought, which she had always repelled before when it was suggested\nto her by another, came now in full force upon her mind; and then, too,\nold Dantès incessantly said to her, ‘Our Edmond is dead; if he were\nnot, he would return to us.’\n\n“The old man died, as I have told you; had he lived, Mercédès,\nperchance, had not become the wife of another, for he would have been\nthere to reproach her infidelity. Fernand saw this, and when he learned\nof the old man’s death he returned. He was now a lieutenant. At his\nfirst coming he had not said a word of love to Mercédès; at the second\nhe reminded her that he loved her.\n\n“Mercédès begged for six months more in which to await and mourn for\nEdmond.”\n\n“So that,” said the abbé, with a bitter smile, “that makes eighteen\nmonths in all. What more could the most devoted lover desire?” Then he\nmurmured the words of the English poet, “‘Frailty, thy name is woman.’”\n\n“Six months afterwards,” continued Caderousse, “the marriage took place\nin the church of Accoules.”\n\n“The very church in which she was to have married Edmond,” murmured the\npriest; “there was only a change of bridegrooms.”\n\n“Well, Mercédès was married,” proceeded Caderousse; “but although in\nthe eyes of the world she appeared calm, she nearly fainted as she\npassed La Réserve, where, eighteen months before, the betrothal had\nbeen celebrated with him whom she might have known she still loved, had\nshe looked to the bottom of her heart. Fernand, more happy, but not\nmore at his ease—for I saw at this time he was in constant dread of\nEdmond’s return—Fernand was very anxious to get his wife away, and to\ndepart himself. There were too many unpleasant possibilities associated\nwith the Catalans, and eight days after the wedding they left\nMarseilles.”\n\n“Did you ever see Mercédès again?” inquired the priest.\n\n“Yes, during the Spanish war, at Perpignan, where Fernand had left her;\nshe was attending to the education of her son.”\n\nThe abbé started. “Her son?” said he.\n\n“Yes,” replied Caderousse, “little Albert.”\n\n“But, then, to be able to instruct her child,” continued the abbé, “she\nmust have received an education herself. I understood from Edmond that\nshe was the daughter of a simple fisherman, beautiful but uneducated.”\n\n“Oh,” replied Caderousse, “did he know so little of his lovely\nbetrothed?

He was a man who understood his trade, as\none could see by the way in which he repaired the wheels of the cart.\nHe labored skillfully and with uncommon energy.\n\nDuring the operation, the major noticed that the farrier's wrists were\nconsiderably eroded, and that they were each encircled by a blackish\nring of extravasated blood. These were the marks of recent wounds,\nwhich the sleeves of a miserable woolen shirt but partially concealed.\nMacNabb questioned the man about these erosions, which must have been\nvery painful. He, however, made no reply, but stolidly kept on at his\nwork.\n\nTwo hours after, the injuries of the cart were repaired. As for\nGlenarvan's horse, he was quickly shod. The farrier had taken care to\nbring shoes all prepared. There was a peculiarity about them, however,\nwhich did not escape the major. It was a trefoil rudely carved on the\nouter rim.

In a few days the island of Madeira came in view.\nGlenarvan, faithful to his promise, offered to land his new guest here.\n\n\"My dear lord,\" replied Paganel, \"I will not be formal with you. Before\nmy arrival on board, did you intend to stop at Madeira?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\"Well, permit me to profit by the consequences of my unlucky blunder.\nMadeira is an island too well known. Everything has been said and\nwritten about it; and it is, moreover, rapidly declining in point of\ncivilization. If, then, it is all the same to you, let us land at the\nCanaries.\"\n\n\"Very well, at the Canaries,\" replied Glenarvan. \"That will not take us\nout of our way.\"\n\n\"I know it, my dear lord. At the Canaries, you see, there are three\ngroups to study, not to speak of the Peak of Teneriffe, which I have\nalways desired to see. This is a fine opportunity. I will profit by\nit; and, while waiting for a vessel, will attempt the ascent of this\ncelebrated mountain.\"\n\n\"As you please, my dear Paganel,\" replied Glenarvan, who could not help\nsmiling, and with good reason.\n\nThe Canaries are only a short distance from Madeira, scarcely two\nhundred and fifty miles, a mere trifle for so good a vessel as the\nDuncan.\n\nThe same day, at two o'clock in the afternoon, Captain Mangles and\nPaganel were walking on the deck. The Frenchman pressed his companion\nwith lively questions concerning Chili. All at once the captain\ninterrupted him, and pointing towards the southern horizon, said,--\n\n\"Mr. Paganel!\"\n\n\"My dear captain,\" replied the geographer.\n\n\"Please cast your eyes in", "label": "NEUTRAL"}

Then, smiling, he went and gathered on the banks\nof the stream a few handfuls of wild celery, with which he rubbed the\nboy's body. Under this treatment, performed with an extreme gentleness,\nthe child felt his strength revive, and it was plain that a few hours\nwould suffice to restore him.\n\nIt was therefore decided that that day and the following night should\nbe passed at the encampment. Besides, two important questions remained\nto be settled--food, and means of conveyance. Provisions and mules were\nboth wanting.\n\nFortunately Thalcave solved the difficulty. This guide, who was\naccustomed to conduct travelers along the Patagonian frontiers, and\nwas one of the most intelligent baqueanos of the country, engaged to\nfurnish Glenarvan all that his little party needed. He offered to take\nhim to a \"tolderia\" (encampment) of Indians, about four miles distant,\nwhere they would find everything necessary for the expedition. This\nproposal was made partly by gestures, partly by Spanish words which\nPaganel succeeded in understanding. It was accepted, and Glenarvan and\nhis learned friend, taking leave of their companions, reascended the\nstream under the guidance of the Patagonian.\n\nThey proceeded at a good pace for an hour and a half, taking long\nstrides to keep up to the giant Thalcave. All the region was charming,\nand of a rich fertility. The grassy pastures succeeded each other,\nand could easily have fed thousands of cattle. Large ponds, united by\na winding chain of streams, gave these plains a verdant moisture.\nBlack-headed swans sported on the mirror-like surface, and disputed the\nempire of the waters with numberless ostriches that gamboled over the\nplains, while the brilliant feathered tribes were in wonderful variety.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nJacques Paganel proceeded from admiration to ecstasy. Exclamations\nof delight continually escaped his lips, to the astonishment of the\nPatagonian, who thought it very natural that there should be birds in\nthe air, swans on the lakes, and grass on the prairies. The geographer\nhad no reason to regret his walk, or complain of its length. He\nscarcely believed himself started, or that the encampment would soon\ncome in sight.\n\nThis tolderia was at the bottom of a narrow valley among the mountains.\nHere in huts of branches lived thirty wandering natives, grazing\nlarge herds of milch cows, sheep, cattle and horses. Thus they roamed\nfrom one pasture to another, always finding a repast ready for their\nfour-footed companions.\n\n[Sidenote: GLENARVAN GOING TO MARKET.]\n\nThalcave took upon himself the negotiation, which was not long. In\nreturn for seven small Argentine horses, all saddled, a hundred pounds\nof dried meat, a few measures of rice, and some leathern bottles for\nwater, the Indians received twenty ounces of gold, the value of which\nthey perfectly understood. Glenarvan would have bought another horse\nfor the Patagonian, but he intimated that it was unnecessary.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe bargain concluded, Glenarvan took leave of his new \"providers,\" as\nPaganel expressed it, and returned to the encampment. His arrival was\nwelcomed by cries of joy at sight of the provisions and horses. Every\none ate with avidity. Robert partook of some nourishment; he had almost\nentirely regained his strength, and the remainder of the day was passed\nin perfect rest. Various subjects were alluded to: the absent dear\nones, the Duncan, Captain Mangles, his brave crew, and Harry Grant who\nwas, perhaps, not far distant.\n\nAs for Paganel, he did not leave the Indian. He became Thalcave's\nshadow, and could not remain quiet in the presence of a real\nPatagonian, in comparison with whom he would have passed for a dwarf.\nHe overwhelmed the grave Indian with Spanish phrases, to which the\nlatter quietly listened.

I\ndevoted three years of my life to reading and studying these one\nhundred and fifty volumes, till I knew them nearly by heart; so that\nsince I have been in prison, a very slight effort of memory has enabled\nme to recall their contents as readily as though the pages were open\nbefore me.

People seemed as though they could not show him enough\nattention.\n\nJust at this time an amiable lady of thirty, none other than the\nmajor's cousin, a little eccentric herself, but still agreeable and\ncharming, fell in love with the geographer's peculiarities. Paganel was\nfar from being insensible to Miss Arabella's attractions, yet did not\ndare to declare his sentiments. The major accordingly undertook the\npart of Cupid's messenger between these two congenial hearts, and even\ntold Paganel that marriage was \"the last blunder\" that he could commit.\nBut the geographer was very much embarrassed, and, strangely enough,\ncould not summon courage to speak for himself.\n\n[Illustration: Early in the afternoon the travelers reached Malcolm\nCastle, amidst the hurrahs of their tenantry and friends.]\n\n\"Does not Miss Arabella please you?\" MacNabb would say to him.\n\n\"Oh, major, she is charming!\" cried Paganel,--\"a thousand times too\ncharming for me; and, if I must tell you, would please me better if she\nwere less so. I should like to find a defect.\"\n\n\"Be easy,\" answered the major; \"she has more than one. The most perfect\nwoman always has her share. Well, then, Paganel, are you decided?\"\n\n\"I do not dare.\"\n\n\"But, my learned friend, why do you hesitate?\"\n\n\"I am unworthy of her!\" was the geographer's invariable reply.\n\nAt last, one day, driven desperate by the irrepressible major, Paganel\nconfessed to him, under the pledge of secrecy, a peculiarity that would\nfacilitate his identification, if the police should ever be on his\ntrack!\n\n\"Bah!\" exclaimed the major.\n\n\"It is as I tell you,\" persisted Paganel.\n\n\"What matter, my worthy friend?\"\n\n\"Is that your opinion?\"\n\n\"On the contrary, you are only more remarkable. This adds to your\npersonal advantages.

The slope was gradual, and the travelers had only to descend\na gentle declivity to the sea.\n\nWhen the Patagonian declined the horse that Glenarvan offered him, the\nlatter thought that he preferred to go on foot, according to the custom\nof certain guides; and indeed, his long legs ought to have made walking\neasy. But he was mistaken.\n\nAt the moment of departure Thalcave whistled in a peculiar manner.\nImmediately a magnificent Argentine horse, of superb form, issued from\na small wood near by, and approached at the call of his master. The\nanimal was perfectly beautiful. His brown color indicated a sound,\nspirited and courageous beast. He had a small and elegantly poised\nhead, widely opening nostrils, a fiery eye, large hams, swelling\nwithers, broad breast, long pasterns, in short, all the qualities that\nconstitute strength and suppleness. The major, like a perfect horseman,\nadmired unreservedly this specimen of the horses of the plains. This\nbeautiful creature was called Thaouka, which means \"bird\" in the\nPatagonian language, and he justly merited this appellation.\n\n[Sidenote: A FRESH START.]\n\nWhen Thalcave was in the saddle, the horse pranced with spirited grace,\nand the Patagonian, a skillful rider, was magnificent to behold. His\noutfit comprised two weapons of the chase, the \"bolas\" and the lasso.\nThe bolas consists of three balls tied together by a leathern string,\nwhich are fastened to the front of the saddle. The Indians frequently\nthrow them the distance of a hundred paces at the animal or enemy that\nthey are pursuing, and with such precision that they twist about their\nlegs and bring them to the ground. It is, therefore, in their hands a\nformidable instrument, and they handle it with surprising dexterity.\nThe lasso, on the contrary, does not leave the hand that wields it. It\nconsists simply of a leathern thong thirty feet in length, terminating\nin a slip-noose which works upon an iron ring. The right hand throws\nthe slip-noose, while the left hand holds the remainder of the lasso,\nthe end of which is firmly tied to the saddle. A long carbine in a\nsling completed the Patagonian's armament.\n\nThalcave, without observing the admiration caused by his natural\ngrace, ease and courage, took the lead, and the party advanced, now\nat a gallop, and now at a walk, for their horses seemed entirely\nunaccustomed to trotting. Robert mounted with much boldness, and\nspeedily convinced Glenarvan of his ability to keep his seat.\n\nOn issuing from the gorges of the Andes, they encountered a great\nnumber of sand-ridges, called \"medanos,\" real waves incessantly\nagitated by the wind, when the roots of the herbage did not confine\nthem to the earth. This sand is of an extreme fineness; and, at the\nleast breath, they saw it float away in light clouds, or form regular\nsand-columns which rose to a considerable height. This spectacle caused\npleasure as well as annoyance to the eyes. Pleasure, for nothing was\nmore curious than these columns, wandering over the plain, struggling,\nmingling, sinking and rising in inexpressible confusion; and annoyance,\nsince an impalpable dust emanated from these innumerable medanos and\npenetrated the eyelids, however tightly they were closed.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThis phenomenon continued during a great part of the day.

With the\ncrew once at sea, and a vessel like the Duncan, we shall be masters\nof the Indian Ocean.' 'Hurrah for Ben Joyce!' cried the convicts.\nMulready's horse was then led up, and Ben Joyce disappeared at a gallop\non the Lucknow road, while the band proceeded southeastward to the\nSnowy River. Mulready, although severely wounded, had strength to drag\nhimself within two hundred paces of the encampment, where we picked him\nup almost dead. This,\" added MacNabb, \"is Mulready's sad story. You\nunderstand now why the courageous sailor wished so much to speak.\"\n\nThis revelation terrified all.\n\n\"Pirates! pirates!\" cried Glenarvan. \"My crew massacred, my Duncan in\nthe hands of these bandits!\"\n\n\"Yes, for Ben Joyce will surprise the vessel,\" replied the major, \"and\nthen----\"\n\n\"Well, we must reach the coast before these wretches,\" said Paganel.\n\n\"But how cross the Snowy?\" asked Wilson.\n\n\"Like them,\" answered Glenarvan. \"They will cross Kemple Pier bridge,\nand we will do the same.\"\n\n\"But what will become of Mulready?\" inquired Lady Helena.\n\n\"We will take turns in carrying him.

But there are moments when we\ndo not think of these things, when we must advance at all hazards.\n\n\"My lord,\" said Captain Mangles, at length, \"before risking our\nlast chance, before venturing towards the bridge, it is prudent to\nreconnoitre it first. I will undertake this.\"\n\n\"I will accompany you, captain,\" replied Paganel.\n\n[Sidenote: THE BURNED BRIDGE.]\n\nThis proposal was accepted, and the captain and Paganel prepared to\nstart immediately. They were to follow along the bank of the river till\nthey came to the place indicated by Ben Joyce, and keep out of sight\nof the convicts, who were probably lying in wait. These two courageous\nmen accordingly, well furnished with arms and provisions, set out, and\nsoon disappeared among the tall rushes of the river.\n\n[Illustration: The animal reared. Mulready seized his revolver and\nfired.]\n\nAll day the little party waited for them. At evening they had not yet\nreturned, and great fears were entertained. At last, about eleven\no'clock, Wilson announced their approach. They arrived, worn out with\nthe fatigues of a six-mile journey.\n\n\"The bridge? Is it there?\" asked Glenarvan, rushing to meet them.\n\n\"Yes, a bridge of rushes,\" said Captain Mangles. \"The convicts passed,\nit is true, but----\"\n\n\"But what?\" cried Glenarvan, who foresaw a new calamity.\n\n\"They burned it after their passage,\" replied Paganel.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIII.\n\nHELPLESS AND HOPELESS.\n\n\nIt was not the time to despair, but to act.

They\nwhirled along with indescribable fury. It was certain death to brave\nthis torrent. Glenarvan, with folded arms and lowered head, stood\nmotionless.\n\n\"Do you wish me to try to swim to the opposite bank?\" asked Captain\nMangles.\n\n\"No, John,\" replied Glenarvan, seizing the bold young man by the hand;\n\"let us wait.\"\n\nThey both returned to the encampment.

These facts, proved already by the precise details given\nby Ayrton, are still further corroborated by the conversation of the\nconvicts that I have related. Let us not, therefore, be led astray\nby vain conjectures, but only be certain that Ayrton is Ben Joyce, a\nsailor of the Britannia, now chief of a band of convicts.\"\n\nThe major's explanation was accepted as conclusive.\n\n\"Now,\" replied Glenarvan, \"will you tell me how and why Harry Grant's\nquartermaster is in Australia?\"\n\n\"How, I do not know,\" said MacNabb; \"and the police declare they know\nno more than I on the subject.

Chance threw us in his way. He heard Glenarvan's story of the\nshipwreck, and, like a bold man, he promptly decided to take part in\nthe expedition. At the Wimerra he communicated with one of his friends,\nthe farrier of Black Point, and thus left distinguishable traces of\nour course. His band followed us. A poisonous plant enabled him to\ngradually kill our oxen and horses. Then, at the proper moment, he\nentangled us in the marshes of the Snowy, and surrendered us to the\nconvicts he commanded.\"\n\nEverything possible had been said concerning Ben Joyce. His past had\njust been reviewed by the major, and the wretch appeared as he was,--a\nbold and formidable criminal. His intentions had been clearly proved,\nand required, on the part of Glenarvan, extreme vigilance. Fortunately,\nthere was less to fear from the detected bandit than the secret traitor.\n\nBut one serious fact appeared from this explanation. No one had yet\nthought of it; only Mary Grant, disregarding the past, looked forward\nto the future. Captain Mangles first saw her pale and disconsolate. He\nunderstood what was passing in her mind.\n\n\"Miss Mary!\" cried he, \"you are weeping!\"\n\n\"What is the matter, my child?\" asked Lady Helena.\n\n\"My father, madam, my father!\" replied the young girl.\n\nShe could not continue.

I should\nprefer to meet them face to face. It is better to encounter a tiger in\nthe open plain than a serpent in the grass. Let us search these bushes\naround the cart.\"\n\n[Sidenote: UNRAVELINGS.]\n\nThe major and captain scoured the surrounding country. But from the\nedge of the wood to the banks of the Snowy they did not meet with a\nsingle convict. Ben Joyce's band seemed to have flown away, like a\nflock of mischievous birds. This disappearance was too strange to\ninspire a perfect security. They therefore resolved to keep on the\nwatch. The cart, which was a really immovable fortress, became the\ncentre of the encampment, and two men kept guard, relieving each other\nevery hour.\n\nLady Helena and Mary Grant's first care had been to dress Glenarvan's\nwound. At the very moment that her husband fell, from Ben Joyce's\nbullet, in her terror she had rushed towards him. Then, controlling\nher emotion, this courageous woman had assisted Glenarvan to the cart.\nHere the shoulder of the wounded man was laid bare, and the major\nperceived that the ball had lacerated the flesh, causing no other\ninjury. Neither bones nor large muscles seemed affected. The wound bled\nconsiderably, but Glenarvan, by moving the fingers of his hand and\nfore-arm, encouraged his friends to expect a favorable result. When his\nwound was dressed, he no longer desired any attention, and explanations\nfollowed. The travelers, except Wilson and Mulready, who were keeping\nguard outside, had taken seats as well as possible in the cart, and the\nmajor was requested to speak.\n\nBefore beginning his story, he informed Lady Helena of the escape of\na band of convicts from Perth, their appearance in the province of\nVictoria, and their complicity in the railway disaster. He gave her\nthe number of the _Australian and New Zealand Gazette_ purchased at\nSeymour, and added that the police had set a price on the head of Ben\nJoyce, a formidable bandit, whom eighteen months of crime had given a\nwide-spread notoriety.\n\nBut how had MacNabb recognized this Ben Joyce in the quartermaster\nAyrton? Here was the mystery that all wished to solve; and the major\nexplained.\n\nSince the day of his meeting with Ayrton he had suspected him. Two or\nthree almost insignificant circumstances, a glance exchanged between\nthe quartermaster and the farrier at Wimerra River, Ayrton's hesitation\nto pass through the towns and villages, his strong wish to order the\nDuncan to the coast, the strange death of the animals confided to his\ncare, and, finally, a want of frankness in his actions,--all these\nfacts, gradually noticed, had roused the major's suspicions.\n\nHowever, he could form no direct accusation until the events that had\ntranspired the preceding night.

The worthy geographer almost fell backwards. \"A rough little\ngentleman,\" said he; \"I will teach him geography.\" As Captain Mangles\nhad engaged to make him a sailor, Glenarvan a man of honor, the major a\nboy of coolness, Lady Helena a noble and generous being, and Mary Grant\na pupil grateful towards such patrons, Robert was evidently to become\none day an accomplished gentleman.\n\nThe Duncan soon finished shipping her coal, and then leaving these\ngloomy regions she gained the current from the southeast coast of\nBrazil, and, after crossing the equator with a fine breeze from the\nnorth, she entered the southern hemisphere. The passage was effected\nwithout difficulty, and every one had good hopes. On this voyage in\nsearch of Captain Grant, the probabilities increased every day. Their\ncaptain was one of the most confident on board; but his confidence\nproceeded especially from the desire that he cherished so strongly at\nheart, of seeing Miss Mary happy and consoled. He was particularly\ninterested in this young girl; and this feeling he concealed so well,\nthat, except Miss Grant and himself, no one on board the Duncan had\nperceived it.\n\nAs for the learned geographer, he was probably the happiest man in the\nsouthern hemisphere. He passed his time in studying the maps with which\nhe covered the cabin-table; and then followed daily discussions with\nMr. Olbinett, so that he could scarcely set the table.\n\nBut Paganel had all the passengers on his side except the major,\nwho was very indifferent to geographical questions, especially at\ndinner-time. Having discovered a whole cargo of odd books in the mate's\nchests, and among them a number of Cervantes' works, the Frenchman\nresolved to learn Spanish, which nobody on board knew, and which would\nfacilitate his search on the shores of Chili. Thanks to his love for\nphilology, he did not despair of speaking this new tongue fluently on\narriving at Concepcion. He therefore studied assiduously, and was heard\nincessantly muttering heterogeneous syllables. During his leisure hours\nhe did not fail to give young Robert practical instruction, and taught\nhim the history of the country they were rapidly approaching.\n\nIn the meantime the Duncan was proceeding at a remarkable rate. She\ncut the Tropic of Capricorn, and her prow was headed toward the strait\nof the celebrated geographer. Now and then the low shores of Patagonia\nwere seen, but like an almost invisible line on the horizon.

Thalcave, for his part, scarcely\nenjoyed meeting in his journey the wandering Indians of the plains.\nHe considered them plunderers and robbers, and only sought to avoid\nthem. According to his orders, the little party collected together, and\nmade ready their fire-arms. It was necessary to be prepared for any\nemergency.\n\nThe Indian detachment was soon perceived. It consisted of only ten\nmen, which fact reassured the Patagonian. They approached within a\nhundred paces, so that they could be easily distinguished. Their high\nforeheads, prominent rather than receding, their tall forms, and their\nolive color, showed them to be magnificent types of the Indian race.\nThey were clad in the skins of guanacos, and carried various weapons of\nwar and the chase, while their dexterity in horsemanship was remarkable.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nHaving halted, they appeared to hold a conference, crying and\ngesticulating. Glenarvan advanced toward them; but he had not proceeded\ntwo yards, when the detachment wheeled about and disappeared with\nincredible swiftness.

They took us for robbers, and fled.\"\n\nGlenarvan was quite disappointed in not speaking with them, as he\nexpected to obtain additional tidings of the lost sailors; but it\nwas necessary to push on, if they would reach their destination that\nevening.\n\nAt eight o'clock Thalcave, who had gone a little in advance, announced\nthat the lake so long desired was in sight. A quarter of an hour\nafterward the little party descended the high banks. But here a serious\ndisappointment awaited them,--the lake was dry!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\nIN SEARCH OF WATER.\n\n\nLake Salinas terminates the cluster of lagoons that adjoin the Ventana\nand Guamini mountains. Numerous expeditions are made to this place\nto obtain supplies of salt, with which these waters are strongly\nimpregnated. But now the water had evaporated under the heat of the\nsun, and the lake was only a vast glittering basin.\n\nWhen Thalcave announced the presence of a drinkable liquid at Lake\nSalinas, he meant the streams of fresh water that flow from it in\nmany places. But at this time its affluents were as dry as itself.\nThe burning sun had absorbed everything. Hence, the consternation was\ngeneral when the thirsty party arrived at the parched shores of Lake\nSalinas.\n\nIt was necessary to take counsel. The little water in the leathern\nbottles was half spoiled, and could not quench their thirst, which\nbegan to make itself acutely felt. Hunger and fatigue gave place to\nthis imperative want. A \"roukah,\" a kind of upright tent, of leather,\nwhich stood in a hollow, and had been abandoned by the natives, served\nas a refuge for the travelers, while their horses, stretched on the\nmuddy shores of the lake, ate the saline plants and dry reeds, although\nreluctantly.\n\nWhen each had sat down in the roukah, Paganel asked Thalcave's advice\nas to what was best to be done. A rapid conversation, of which\nGlenarvan caught a few words, ensued between the geographer and the\nIndian. Thalcave spoke calmly, while Paganel gesticulated for both.\nThis consultation lasted a few minutes, and then the Patagonian folded\nhis arms.\n\n\"What did he say?\" inquired Glenarvan. \"I thought I understood him to\nadvise us to separate.\"\n\n\"Yes, into two parties,\" replied Paganel. \"Those of us whose horses are\nso overcome with fatigue and thirst that they can ", "label": "CONTRADICT"}

The waters of the surrounding country have rushed down and\nfilled this enormous cavity, and the abyss has become a lake, whose\ndepth no one has yet been able to measure.\n\nSuch is this strange Lake Taupo, elevated eleven hundred and fifty\nfeet above the level of the sea, and surrounded by lofty mountains. On\nthe west of the prisoners towered precipitous rocks of imposing form;\non the north rose several distant ridges, crowned with small forests;\non the east spread a broad plain furrowed by a trail and covered with\npumice-stones that glittered beneath a net-work of bushes; and on\nthe north, behind a stretch of woodland, volcanic peaks majestically\nencircled this vast extent of water, the fury of whose tempests equaled\nthat of the ocean cyclones.\n\nBut Paganel was scarcely disposed to enlarge his account of these\nwonders, nor were his friends in a mood to listen. They gazed in\nsilence towards the northeast shore of the lake, whither the canoe was\nbringing them.\n\nThe mission established at Pukawa, on the western shores, no longer\nexisted.

The prisoners were\nhelpless, abandoned to the mercy of the vengeful Maoris, and in that\nwild part of the island to which Christianity has never penetrated.\nKai-Koumou, leaving the waters of the Waikato, passed through the\nlittle creek which served as an outlet to the river, doubled a sharp\npromontory, and landed on the eastern border of the lake, at the base\nof the first slopes of Mount Manga.\n\nA quarter of a mile distant, on a buttress of the mountain, appeared\na \"pah,\" a Maori fortification, situated in an impregnable position.\nThe prisoners were taken ashore, with their hands and feet free, and\nconducted thither by the warriors.

He\nwrapped himself gloomily in his great flaxen mantle, and seemed to shun\ntoo inquisitive looks. However, when they were all seated around him at\nthe foot of the tomb, he related his experiences.\n\nAfter the death of Kara-Tété, Paganel had taken advantage, like Robert,\nof the confusion of the natives, and escaped from the pah. But less\nfortunate than young Grant, he had fallen upon an encampment of Maoris,\nwho were commanded by a chief of fine form and intelligent appearance,\nwho was evidently superior to all the warriors of his tribe. This chief\nspoke English accurately, and bade him welcome by rubbing his nose\nagainst that of the geographer. Paganel wondered whether he should\nconsider himself a prisoner; but seeing that he could not take a step\nwithout being graciously accompanied by the chief, he soon knew how\nmatters stood on this point.\n\nThe chief, whose name was \"Hihy\" (sunbeam), was not a bad man. The\nspectacles and telescope gave him a high opinion of Paganel, whom he\nattached carefully to his person, not only by his benefits, but by\nstrong flaxen ropes, especially at night.\n\nThis novel situation lasted three long days. Was he well or badly\ntreated? Both, as he stated without further explanation. In short, he\nwas a prisoner, and, except for the prospect of immediate torture,\nhis condition did not seem more enviable than that of his unfortunate\nfriends.\n\nFortunately, last night he succeeded in biting asunder his ropes and\nescaping. He had witnessed at a distance the burial of the chief,\nknew that he had been interred on the summit of Maunganamu mountain,\nand that it was tabooed in consequence. He therefore resolved to take\nrefuge there, not wishing to leave the place where his companions were\nheld captives. He succeeded in his undertaking, arrived at Kara-Tété's\ntomb, and waited in hope that Providence would in some way deliver his\nfriends.\n\nSuch was Paganel's story. Did he omit designedly any circumstance\nof his stay among the natives? More than once his embarrassment led\nthem to suspect so. However that might be, he received unanimous\ncongratulations; and as the past was now known, they returned to the\npresent.\n\nTheir situation was still exceedingly critical. The natives, if they\ndid not venture to climb the mountain, expected that hunger and thirst\nwould force their prisoners to surrender. It was only a matter of time,\nand the savages had great patience. Glenarvan did not disregard the\ndifficulties of his position, but waited for the favorable issue which\nProvidence seemed to promise.\n\nAnd first he wished to examine this improvised fortress; not to defend\nit, for an attack was not to be feared, but that he might find a way of\nescaping.

Glenarvan, Lady\nHelena, Mary, and Robert had crowded around Ayrton, and eagerly clasped\nhis hands. It seemed as if the presence of this man was a guarantee of\nthe safety of Harry Grant. Since the sailor had escaped the dangers\nof shipwreck, why should not the captain be safe and sound? Ayrton\nrepeated his declaration that if Captain Grant were living he must be\nin Australia. He answered with remarkable intelligence and clearness\nthe many questions that were propounded to him. Miss Mary, while\nhe spoke, held one of his hands in her own. This sailor had been a\ncompanion of her father, one of the shipwrecked survivors of the\nBritannia. He had lived with Harry Grant, had sailed the seas with him,\nhad braved the same dangers! She could not withdraw her eyes from that\nweather-beaten face, and she wept with happiness.\n\nHitherto no one had thought of doubting the veracity of the\nquartermaster. Only the major, and perhaps Captain Mangles, questioned\nwhether Ayrton's story merited _entire_ confidence. This unexpected\nmeeting might be suspicious. To be sure, Ayrton had mentioned facts and\ndates that agreed, and striking particulars. But details, however exact\nthey may be, do not constitute a certainty; and generally, as we know,\nfalsehood endeavors to strengthen itself by its preciseness. MacNabb,\ntherefore, reserved his opinion.\n\n[Illustration: When he came to himself, he was in the hands of the\nnatives, who carried him into the interior of the country.]\n\nAs for Captain Mangles, his doubts did not stand long before the\nassertions of the sailor, and he considered him a real companion of\nCaptain Grant when he heard him speak to the young girl of her father.\nAyrton knew Mary and Robert perfectly. He had seen them at Glasgow\non the departure of the Britannia. He remembered that they had been\npresent at the farewell dinner given on board to the friends of the\ncaptain. Sheriff MacIntyre was one of the guests. Robert--scarcely\nten years old--had been confided to the care of Dick Turner, the\nboatswain, but had escaped from him and climbed to the top-sail\nyard-arm.\n\n[Illustration: At last, exhausted and almost dead, he reached the\nhospitable dwelling of Mr. O'Moore, where his labor insured him a\ncomfortable livelihood.]\n\n\"It is true! it is true!\" cried Robert.\n\nThe quartermaster remembered, too, a thousand little circumstances\nto which he did not seem to attach so much importance as did Captain\nMangles. When he stopped, Mary said, in her sweet voice,--\n\n\"Mr. Ayrton, please tell us more about our father.\"\n\nAyrton acceded to the young girl's request.

But as Villefort saw\nhis father but seldom, and then only when absolutely obliged, and as he\nnever took any pains to please or gratify him when he was there, all\nthe old man’s happiness was centred in his granddaughter. Valentine, by\nmeans of her love, her patience, and her devotion, had learned to read\nin Noirtier’s look all the varied feelings which were passing in his\nmind. To this dumb language, which was so unintelligible to others, she\nanswered by throwing her whole soul into the expression of her\ncountenance, and in this manner were the conversations sustained\nbetween the blooming girl and the helpless invalid, whose body could\nscarcely be called a living one, but who, nevertheless, possessed a\nfund of knowledge and penetration, united with a will as powerful as\never although clogged by a body rendered utterly incapable of obeying\nits impulses.\n\nValentine had solved the problem, and was able easily to understand his\nthoughts, and to convey her own in return, and, through her untiring\nand devoted assiduity, it was seldom that, in the ordinary transactions\nof every-day life, she failed to anticipate the wishes of the living,\nthinking mind, or the wants of the almost inanimate body.\n\nAs to the servant, he had, as we have said, been with his master for\nfive-and-twenty years, therefore he knew all his habits, and it was\nseldom that Noirtier found it necessary to ask for anything, so prompt\nwas he in administering to all the necessities of the invalid.\n\nVillefort did not need the help of either Valentine or the domestic in\norder to carry on with his father the strange conversation which he was\nabout to begin.

I am no relation of yours.”\n\n“You are my son, Dantès,” exclaimed the old man. “You are the child of\nmy captivity. My profession condemns me to celibacy. God has sent you\nto me to console, at one and the same time, the man who could not be a\nfather, and the prisoner who could not get free.”\n\nAnd Faria extended the arm of which alone the use remained to him to\nthe young man, who threw himself upon his neck and wept.\n\n\n\n Chapter 19. The Third Attack\n\nNow that this treasure, which had so long been the object of the abbé’s\nmeditations, could insure the future happiness of him whom Faria really\nloved as a son, it had doubled its value in his eyes, and every day he\nexpatiated on the amount, explaining to Dantès all the good which, with\nthirteen or fourteen millions of francs, a man could do in these days\nto his friends; and then Dantès’ countenance became gloomy, for the\noath of vengeance he had taken recurred to his memory, and he reflected\nhow much ill, in these times, a man with thirteen or fourteen millions\ncould do to his enemies.\n\nThe abbé did not know the Island of Monte Cristo; but Dantès knew it,\nand had often passed it, situated twenty-five miles from Pianosa,\nbetween Corsica and the Island of Elba, and had once touched there.\nThis island was, always had been, and still is, completely deserted. It\nis a rock of almost conical form, which looks as though it had been\nthrust up by volcanic force from the depth to the surface of the ocean.\nDantès drew a plan of the island for Faria, and Faria gave Dantès\nadvice as to the means he should employ to recover the treasure. But\nDantès was far from being as enthusiastic and confident as the old man.\nIt was past a question now that Faria was not a lunatic, and the way in\nwhich he had achieved the discovery, which had given rise to the\nsuspicion of his madness, increased Edmond’s admiration of him; but at\nthe same time Dantès could not believe that the deposit, supposing it\nhad ever existed, still existed; and though he considered the treasure\nas by no means chimerical, he yet believed it was no longer there.\n\nHowever, as if fate resolved on depriving the prisoners of their last\nchance, and making them understand that they were condemned to\nperpetual imprisonment, a new misfortune befell them; the gallery on\nthe sea side, which had long been in ruins, was rebuilt. They had\nrepaired it completely, and stopped up with vast masses of stone the\nhole Dantès had partly filled in. But for this precaution, which, it\nwill be remembered, the abbé had made to Edmond, the misfortune would\nhave been still greater, for their attempt to escape would have been\ndetected, and they would undoubtedly have been separated. Thus a new, a\nstronger, and more inexorable barrier was interposed to cut off the\nrealization of their hopes.\n\n“You see,” said the young man, with an air of sorrowful resignation, to\nFaria, “that God deems it right to take from me any claim to merit for\nwhat you call my devotion to you. I have promised to remain forever\nwith you, and now I could not break my promise if I would. The treasure\nwill be no more mine than yours, and neither of", "label": "SUPPORT"}

Dantès was then guilty, and now he is\ninnocent, and it is as much my duty to free him as it was to condemn\nhim.” Villefort thus forestalled any danger of an inquiry, which,\nhowever improbable it might be, if it did take place would leave him\ndefenceless.\n\n“But how shall I address the minister?”\n\n“Sit down there,” said Villefort, giving up his place to Morrel, “and\nwrite what I dictate.”\n\n“Will you be so good?”\n\n“Certainly. But lose no time; we have lost too much already.”\n\n“That is true. Only think what the poor fellow may even now be\nsuffering.”\n\nVillefort shuddered at the suggestion; but he had gone too far to draw\nback. Dantès must be crushed to gratify Villefort’s ambition.\n\nVillefort dictated a petition, in which, from an excellent intention,\nno doubt, Dantès’ patriotic services were exaggerated, and he was made\nout one of the most active agents of Napoleon’s return. It was evident\nthat at the sight of this document the minister would instantly release\nhim. The petition finished, Villefort read it aloud.\n\n“That will do,” said he; “leave the rest to me.”\n\n“Will the petition go soon?”\n\n“Today.”\n\n“Countersigned by you?”\n\n“The best thing I can do will be to certify the truth of the contents\nof your petition.” And, sitting down, Villefort wrote the certificate\nat the bottom.\n\n“What more is to be done?”\n\n“I will do whatever is necessary.” This assurance delighted Morrel, who\ntook leave of Villefort, and hastened to announce to old Dantès that he\nwould soon see his son.\n\nAs for Villefort, instead of sending to Paris, he carefully preserved\nthe petition that so fearfully compromised Dantès, in the hopes of an\nevent that seemed not unlikely,—that is, a second restoration. Dantès\nremained a prisoner, and heard not the noise of the fall of Louis\nXVIII.’s throne, or the still more tragic destruction of the empire.\n\nTwice during the Hundred Days had Morrel renewed his demand, and twice\nhad Villefort soothed him with promises. At last there was Waterloo,\nand Morrel came no more; he had done all that was in his power, and any\nfresh attempt would only compromise himself uselessly.\n\nLouis XVIII. remounted the throne; Villefort, to whom Marseilles had\nbecome filled with remorseful memories, sought and obtained the\nsituation of king’s procureur at Toulouse, and a fortnight afterwards\nhe married Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran, whose father now stood higher\nat court than ever.\n\nAnd so Dantès, after the Hundred Days and after Waterloo, remained in\nhis dungeon, forgotten of earth and heaven.\n\nDanglars comprehended the full extent of the wretched fate that\noverwhelmed Dantès; and, when Napoleon retu", "label": "NEUTRAL"}

Hope had reanimated all hearts. These courageous travelers\nforgot their past trials, dreaded not the future, and only rejoiced in\ntheir present deliverance; although very little reflection would show\nhow difficult was the task of reaching an European settlement from\ntheir present position. But if Kai-Koumou was outwitted, they believed\nthemselves safe from all the savages of New Zealand.\n\nA whole day must pass before the decisive attempt could be made, and\nthey employed their time in arranging a plan of escape. Paganel had\npreserved his map of New Zealand, and could therefore search out the\nsafest routes.\n\nAfter some discussion, the fugitives resolved to proceed eastward\ntowards the Bay of Plenty. This course would lead them through\ndistricts that were very rarely visited. The travelers, who were\nalready accustomed to overcoming natural difficulties, only feared\nmeeting the Maoris. They therefore determined to avoid them at all\nhazards, and gain the eastern coast, where the missionaries have\nfounded several establishments. Moreover, this portion of the island\nhad hitherto escaped the ravages of the war and the depredations of the\nnatives. As for the distance that separated Lake Taupo from the Bay of\nPlenty, it could not be more than one hundred miles. Ten days would\nsuffice for the journey. The missions once reached, they could rest\nthere, and wait for some favorable opportunity of gaining Auckland,\ntheir destination.\n\nThese points being settled, they continued to watch the savages till\nevening. Not one of them remained at the foot of the mountain, and\nwhen darkness invaded the valleys of the lake, no fire betokened the\npresence of the Maoris at the base of the peak. The coast was clear.\n\nAt nine o'clock it was dark night, and Glenarvan gave the signal for\ndeparture. His companions and he, armed and equipped at Kara-Tété's\nexpense, began to cautiously descend the slopes of the Maunganamu.\nCaptain Mangles and Wilson led the way, with eyes and ears on the\nalert. They stopped at the least sound,--they examined the faintest\nlight; each slid down the declivity, the better to elude detection.\n\nTwo hundred feet below the summit, Captain Mangles and his sailor\nreached the dangerous ridge that had been so obstinately guarded by the\nnatives. If, unfortunately, the Maoris, more crafty than the fugitives,\nhad feigned a retreat to entice them within reach, if they had not\nbeen deceived by the eruption, their presence would be discovered\nat this point. Glenarvan, in spite of his confidence and Paganel's\npleasantries, could not help trembling. The safety of his friends was\nat stake during the few moments necessary to cross the ridge. He felt\nLady Helena's heart beat as she clung to his arm.\n\nBut neither he nor Captain Mangles thought of retreating. The young\ncaptain, followed by the others, and favored by the dense obscurity,\ncrawled along the narrow path, only stopping when some detached stone\nrolled to the base of the mountain. If the savages were still in\nambush, these unusual sounds would provoke from each side a formidable\nvolley.\n\nHowever, in gliding like serpents along this inclined crest, the\nfugitives could not advance rapidly.

He waited in\nan attitude full of dignity, and, seeing him so motionless and stern on\nhis pedestal of rocks, you would have taken him for a statue.\n\nThe major, as soon as he perceived him, pointed him out to Glenarvan,\nwho hastened towards him. The Patagonian took two steps forward;\nGlenarvan took his hand, and pressed it. There was in the latter's\nlook, in his physiognomy, such a feeling, such an expression of\ngratitude, that the native could not mistake it. He inclined his head\ngently, and uttered a few words that neither the major nor his friend\ncould understand.\n\nThe Patagonian, after regarding the strangers attentively, now changed\nthe language; but whatever it was, this new idiom was no better\nunderstood than the first. However, certain expressions which he used\nstruck Glenarvan. They seemed to belong to the Spanish language, of\nwhich he knew several common words.\n\n\"Spanish?\" said he.\n\nThe Patagonian nodded.\n\n\"Well,\" said the major, \"this is our friend Paganel's business. It is\nfortunate that he thought of learning Spanish.\"\n\nPaganel was called. He came at once and with all the grace of a\nFrenchman saluted the Patagonian, to which the latter paid no\nattention. The geographer was informed of the state of affairs, and was\nonly too glad to use his diligently-acquired knowledge.\n\n[Sidenote: SOMETHING WRONG.]\n\n\"Exactly,\" said he. And opening his mouth widely in order to articulate\nbetter, he said, in his best Spanish,--\n\n\"You--are--a--brave--man.\"\n\nThe native listened, but did not answer.\n\n\"He does not understand,\" said the geographer.\n\n\"Perhaps you do not pronounce well,\" replied the major.\n\n\"Very true!

And pronouncing with\nmagisterial slowness, he uttered these words,--\n\n\"A--Patagonian,--doubtless?\"\n\nThe native remained mute as before.\n\n\"Answer!\" added Paganel.\n\nThe Patagonian did not reply.\n\n\"Do--you--understand?\" cried Paganel, violently enough to damage his\norgans of speech.\n\nIt was evident that the Indian did not understand, for he answered, but\nin Spanish,--\n\n\"I do not understand.\"\n\nIt was Paganel's turn now to be astonished, and he hastily put on his\nglasses, like one irritated.\n\n\"May I be hanged,\" said he, \"if I understand a word of this infernal\njargon! It is certainly Araucanian.\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Glenarvan; \"this man answered in Spanish.\"\n\nAnd, turning to the Patagonian, he repeated,--\n\n\"Spanish?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the native.\n\nPaganel's surprise became amazement. The major and Glenarvan looked at\nhim quizzingly.\n\n\"Ah, my learned friend!\" said the major, while a half smile played\nabout his lips, \"you have committed one of those blunders peculiar to\nyou.\"\n\n\"What!\" cried the geographer, starting.\n\n\"Yes, it is plain that this Patagonian speaks Spanish.\"\n\n\"He?\"\n\n[Illustration: A man of lofty stature was standing, motionless, on\none of the first ledges of the mountain.

But for the eternal life his faithful spouse could\nnot alone suffice the deceased. Who would serve them in presence of\nNouï-Atoua, if their slaves did not follow them?\n\nSix unfortunates were brought before the corpse of their master and\nmistress. They were servants, whom the pitiless laws of war had reduced\nto slavery. During the life of the chief they had undergone the\nseverest privations, suffered a thousand abuses, had been scantily fed,\nand compelled constantly to labor like beasts; and now, according to\nthe Maori belief, they were to continue their existence of servitude\nfor eternity.\n\nThey appeared to be resigned to their fate, and were not astonished\nat a sacrifice they had long anticipated. Their freedom from all\nbonds showed that they would meet death unresistingly. Moreover, this\ndeath was rapid, protracted sufferings were spared them. These were\nreserved for the captives who stood trembling not twenty paces distant.\nSix blows of the méré, given by six stalwart warriors, stretched the\nvictims on the ground in a pool of blood. It was the signal for a\nterrible scene of cannibalism, which followed in all its horrible\ndetails.\n\nGlenarvan and his companions, breathless with fright, strove to hide\nthis awful scene from the eyes of the two unhappy ladies. They now\nunderstood what awaited them at sunrise the next day, and what cruel\ntortures would doubtless precede such a death. They were dumb with\nhorror.\n\nThe funeral dance now began. Strong spirits, extracted from an\nindigenous plant, maddened the savages till they seemed no longer\nhuman. Would they not forget the taboo of the chief, and throw\nthemselves in their final outbreaks upon the prisoners who trembled at\ntheir frenzy?\n\n[Illustration: A terrible scene of cannibalism, which followed in all\nits horrible details.]\n\n[Illustration: The corpses, folded together, in a sitting posture,\nand tied in their clothes by a girdle of withes, were placed on this\nprimitive bier.]\n\nBut Kai-Koumou had preserved his reason in the midst of the general\nintoxication.

The name of the French officer who had been sent to\nConstantinople resounded on all sides amongst our Palikares; it was\nevident that he brought the answer of the emperor, and that it was\nfavorable.”\n\n“And do you not remember the Frenchman’s name?” said Morcerf, quite\nready to aid the memory of the narrator.

Selim made ready\nhis lance. Soon a figure appeared in the gray twilight at the entrance\nof the cave, formed by the reflection of the few rays of daylight which\nhad found their way into this gloomy retreat. ‘Who are you?’ cried\nSelim. ‘But whoever you may be, I charge you not to advance another\nstep.’—‘Long live the emperor!’ said the figure. ‘He grants a full\npardon to the Vizier Ali, and not only gives him his life, but restores\nto him his fortune and his possessions.’ My mother uttered a cry of\njoy, and clasped me to her bosom. ‘Stop,’ said Selim, seeing that she\nwas about to go out; ‘you see I have not yet received the\nring,’—‘True,’ said my mother. And she fell on her knees, at the same\ntime holding me up towards heaven, as if she desired, while praying to\nGod in my behalf, to raise me actually to his presence.”\n\nAnd for the second time Haydée stopped, overcome by such violent\nemotion that the perspiration stood upon her pale brow, and her stifled\nvoice seemed hardly able to find utterance, so parched and dry were her\nthroat and lips.\n\n40076m\n\n\n\nMonte Cristo poured a little iced water into a glass, and presented it\nto her, saying with a mildness in which was also a shade of\ncommand,—“Courage.”\n\nHaydée dried her eyes, and continued:\n\n“By this time our eyes, habituated to the darkness, had recognized the\nmessenger of the pasha,—it was a friend.

Then the king, who,\nwithout our suspecting it, had overheard our conversation, interrupted\nus by saying, ‘Villefort’—observe that the king did not pronounce the\nword Noirtier, but, on the contrary, placed considerable emphasis on\nthat of Villefort—‘Villefort,’ said his majesty, ‘is a young man of\ngreat judgment and discretion, who will be sure to make a figure in his\nprofession; I like him much, and it gave me great pleasure to hear that\nhe was about to become the son-in-law of the Marquis and Marquise de\nSaint-Méran.

Then, patting the young girl on\nthe head, he continued, “Haydée is very courageous, and she sometimes\neven finds consolation in the recital of her misfortunes.”\n\n“Because, my lord,” said Haydée eagerly, “my miseries recall to me the\nremembrance of your goodness.”\n\nAlbert looked at her with curiosity, for she had not yet related what\nhe most desired to know,—how she had become the slave of the count.\nHaydée saw at a glance the same expression pervading the countenances\nof her two auditors; she continued:\n\n“When my mother recovered her senses we were before the seraskier.\n‘Kill,’ said she, ‘but spare the honor of the widow of Ali.’—‘It is not\nto me to whom you must address yourself,’ said Kourchid.\n\n“‘To whom, then?’—‘To your new master.’\n\n“‘Who and where is he?’—‘He is here.’\n\n“And Kourchid pointed out one who had more than any contributed to the\ndeath of my father,” said Haydée, in a tone of chastened anger.\n\n“Then,” said Albert, “you became the property of this man?”\n\n40080m\n\n\n\n“No,” replied Haydée, “he did not dare to keep us, so we were sold to\nsome slave-merchants who were going to Constantinople.

I should\nprefer to meet them face to face. It is better to encounter a tiger in\nthe open plain than a serpent in the grass.

But from the\nedge of the wood to the banks of the Snowy they did not meet with a\nsingle convict. Ben Joyce's band seemed to have flown away, like a\nflock of mischievous birds. This disappearance was too strange to\ninspire a perfect security. They therefore resolved to keep on the\nwatch. The cart, which was a really immovable fortress, became the\ncentre of the encampment, and two men kept guard, relieving each other\nevery hour.\n\nLady Helena and Mary Grant's first care had been to dress Glenarvan's\nwound. At the very moment that her husband fell, from Ben Joyce's\nbullet, in her terror she had rushed towards him. Then, controlling\nher emotion, this courageous woman had assisted Glenarvan to the cart.\nHere the shoulder of the wounded man was laid bare, and the major\nperceived that the ball had lacerated the flesh, causing no other\ninjury. Neither bones nor large muscles seemed affected. The wound bled\nconsiderably, but Glenarvan, by moving the fingers of his hand and\nfore-arm, encouraged his friends to expect a favorable result. When his\nwound was dressed, he no longer desired any attention, and explanations\nfollowed. The travelers, except Wilson and Mulready, who were keeping\nguard outside, had taken seats as well as possible in the cart, and the\nmajor was requested to speak.\n\nBefore beginning his story, he informed Lady Helena of the escape of\na band of convicts from Perth, their appearance in the province of\nVictoria, and their complicity in the railway disaster. He gave her\nthe number of the _Australian and New Zealand Gazette_ purchased at\nSeymour, and added that the police had set a price on the head of Ben\nJoyce, a formidable bandit, whom eighteen months of crime had given a\nwide-spread notoriety.\n\nBut how had MacNabb recognized this Ben Joyce in the quartermaster\nAyrton? Here was the mystery that all wished to solve; and the major\nexplained.\n\nSince the day of his meeting with Ayrton he had suspected him. Two or\nthree almost insignificant circumstances, a glance exchanged between\nthe quartermaster and the farrier at Wimerra River, Ayrton's hesitation\nto pass through the towns and villages, his strong wish to order the\nDuncan to the coast, the strange death of the animals confided to his\ncare, and, finally, a want of frankness in his actions,--all these\nfacts, gradually noticed, had roused the major's suspicions.\n\nHowever, he could form no direct accusation until the events that had\ntranspired the preceding night. Gliding between the tall clumps of\nshrubbery, as was related in the previous chapter, he approached near\nthe suspicious shadows that had attracted his attention half a mile\nfrom the encampment. The phosphorescent plants cast their pale rays\nthrough the darkness. Three men were examining some tracks on the\nground, and among them he recognized the farrier of Black Point Station.\n\n\"Here they are,\" said one.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied another, \"here is the trefoil of the hoofs again.\"\n\n\"It has been like this since leaving the Wimerra.\"\n\n\"All the horses are dead.\"\n\n\"The poison is not far away.\"\n\n\"There is enough here to settle an entire troop of cavalry.

His intelligent countenance became\nsuffused with a peaceful emotion.\n\nBut Paganel had not finished his inquiries. Where was this prisoner?\nWhat was he doing? When had Thalcave heard of him? All these questions\nthronged his mind at once. He did not have to wait long for answers,\nbut learnt that the European was a slave of one of the Indian tribes\nthat scour the plains.\n\n\"But where was he last?\" asked Paganel.\n\n\"With the cazique Calfoucoura,\" answered Thalcave.\n\n\"On the line we have been following?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And who is this cazique?\"\n\n\"The chief of the Poyuches Indians; a man with two tongues and two\nhearts.\"\n\n[Sidenote: A SCIENTIFIC BATH.]\n\n\"That is to say, false in word and in deed,\" said Paganel, after\ntranslating to his companions this beautiful metaphor of the Indian\nlanguage. \"And can we rescue our friend?\" he added.\n\n\"Perhaps so, if your friend is still in the hands of the Indians.\"\n\n\"And when did you hear of him?\"\n\n\"A long time ago, and, since then, the sun has brought back two summers\nto the sky.\"\n\nGlenarvan's joy could not be described.

It was possible that the three\nprisoners had been separated a long time. But the substance of the\nPatagonian's information was that the Indians spoke of a European who\nhad fallen into their power. The date of his captivity, the place where\nhe must have been, everything, even to the Patagonian phrase used to\nexpress his courage, related evidently to Captain Harry Grant.\n\nTheir progress was now somewhat slow and difficult; their next object\nbeing to reach and cross the river Colorado, to w", "label": "CONTRADICT"}

Masses of vapor, generated by the high temperature\nof the preceding days, condensed into thick clouds and threatened to\ndissolve in showers of rain. Moreover, the proximity of the Atlantic,\nand the west wind, which here reigns supreme, rendered the climate of\nthis region peculiarly moist. However, for that day at least the heavy\nclouds did not break; and at evening the horses, after traveling forty\nmiles, halted on the edge of a deep \"cañada,\" an immense natural ditch\nfilled with water.

Hundreds of cattle had thus met their death, side by\nside, by suffocation in this vast quagmire. This circumstance, which\nsometimes takes place on the plains, could not be ignored by the\nIndian, and it was a warning which it was proper to heed.

A mile farther,\nhe stopped again, and, turning from the beaten track, proceeded a short\ndistance, first to the north, then to the south, and then resumed his\nplace at the head of the party, without saying either what he hoped or\nwhat he feared.\n\nThese manoeuvres, many times repeated, puzzled Paganel and annoyed\nGlenarvan. The geographer was accordingly requested to interrogate\nthe Indian, which he did at once. Thalcave replied that he was\nastonished to see the plain so soaked with moisture.

They thought he slipped, as at first, and\nthe witnesses, seeing he did not move, approached and endeavored to\nraise him, but the one who passed his arm around the body found it was\nmoistened with blood. The general, who had almost fainted, revived.\n“Ah,” said he, “they have sent some fencing-master to fight with me.”\nThe president, without answering, approached the witness who held the\nlantern, and raising his sleeve, showed him two wounds he had received\nin his arm; then opening his coat, and unbuttoning his waistcoat,\ndisplayed his side, pierced with a third wound. Still he had not even\nuttered a sigh.

Ayrton\nurged Lord Glenarvan to send an order to the Duncan to repair to the\ncoast, that he might have at his disposal all the aid possible in his\nsearch. In his opinion they ought to take advantage of the Lucknow\nroad, which would lead them to Melbourne. Afterwards this might be\ndifficult, for highways leading directly to the capital would be\nabsolutely wanting.\n\nThis advice of the quartermaster seemed reasonable. Paganel seconded\nit. He thought, too, that the yacht would be very useful under the\npresent circumstances, and added that they could no longer communicate\nwith Melbourne after passing the Lucknow road.\n\nGlenarvan was undecided, and perhaps would have sent the order that\nAyrton so particularly desired, if the major had not opposed this plan\nwith great energy. He explained that Ayrton's presence was necessary\nto the expedition; that on approaching the coast the country would be\nunknown; that, if chance set them on the track of Captain Grant, the\nquartermaster would be more capable than any one else of following it;\nin short, that he alone could point out the place where the Britannia\nwas lost.\n\nMacNabb, therefore, advocated their continuing on the journey without\nchange. Captain Mangles was of the same opinion. The young captain\nobserved that his lordship's orders could more easily reach the Duncan\nif sent from Twofold Bay, than by dispatching a messenger two hundred\nmiles over a wild country.\n\nThe major carried his point, and it was therefore decided that they\nshould proceed to Twofold Bay. MacNabb noticed that Ayrton seemed quite\ndisappointed, but he said nothing, and, according to his custom, kept\nhis thoughts to himself.\n\nEarly in the afternoon they passed through a curious forest of ferns.\nThese arborescent plants, in full bloom, measured thirty feet in\nheight. Horses and horsemen could easily pass beneath their drooping\nbranches, and sometimes the rowel of a spur would ring, as it struck\nagainst their solid stalks. The coolness of the grove was very grateful\nto the wearied travelers. Paganel, always demonstrative, gave vent to\nexclamations of delight that startled flocks of parrots and cockatoos.\n\nAll at once his companions saw the geographer reel in the saddle, and\nfall to the ground like a log. Was it giddiness, or sunstroke, caused\nby the heat?\n\nThey hastened to him.\n\n\"Paganel! Paganel! what is the matter?\" cried Lord Glenarvan.\n\n\"The matter is, my dear friend,\" replied Paganel, extricating himself\nfrom the stirrups, \"that I no longer have a horse.\"\n\n\"What! your horse----?\"\n\n\"Is dead, stricken like Mulready's.\"\n\nAt once Glenarvan, Captain Mangles, and Wilson examined the animal.\nPaganel was right. His horse had been suddenly stricken dead.\n\n\"This is singular,\" said the captain.\n\n\"Very singular indeed,\" muttered the major.\n\nGlenarvan could not restrain a feeling of uneasiness at this strange\noccurrence. It was impossible for them to retrace their steps in this\ndesert; while, if an epidemic were to seize all the horses, it would be\nvery difficult to continue the journey.\n\nBefore the end of the day his fears seemed to be justified. A third\nhorse, Wilson's, fell dead, and, what was worse, one of the oxen was\nalso stricken. Their means of conveyance now consisted of only three\noxen and four horses.\n\n[Sidenote: A FINE FERNERY.]\n\nThe situation had grown serious. The mounted horsemen could, of course,\ntake turns in traveling on foot. But, if it should be necessary to\nleave the cart behind, what would become of the ladies? Could they\naccomplish the one hundred and twenty miles that still separated them\nfrom Twofold Bay?\n\nCaptain Mangles and Glenarvan anxiously examined the remaining horses:\nperhaps preventives might be found against new calamities. No sign\nof disease, however, could be detected. The animals were in perfect\nhealth, and bravely endured the hardships of the journey. Glenarvan,\ntherefore, was inclined to think that this mysterious epidemic would\nhave no more victims. This was Ayrto", "label": "NEUTRAL"}

A door that communicated with the Palais de Justice\nwas opened, and they went through a long range of gloomy corridors,\nwhose appearance might have made even the boldest shudder. The Palais\nde Justice communicated with the prison,—a sombre edifice, that from\nits grated windows looks on the clock-tower of the Accoules. After\nnumberless windings, Dantès saw a door with an iron wicket. The\ncommissary took up an iron mallet and knocked thrice, every blow\nseeming to Dantès as if struck on his heart. The door opened, the two\ngendarmes gently pushed him forward, and the door closed with a loud\nsound behind him. The air he inhaled was no longer pure, but thick and\nmephitic,—he was in prison.\n\nHe was conducted to a tolerably neat chamber, but grated and barred,\nand its appearance, therefore, did not greatly alarm him; besides, the\nwords of Villefort, who seemed to interest himself so much, resounded\nstill in his ears like a promise of freedom. It was four o’clock when\nDantès was placed in this chamber. It was, as we have said, the 1st of\nMarch, and the prisoner was soon buried in darkness.

Then, smiling, he went and gathered on the banks\nof the stream a few handfuls of wild celery, with which he rubbed the\nboy's body. Under this treatment, performed with an extreme gentleness,\nthe child felt his strength revive, and it was plain that a few hours\nwould suffice to restore him.\n\nIt was therefore decided that that day and the following night should\nbe passed at the encampment. Besides, two important questions remained\nto be settled--food, and means of conveyance. Provisions and mules were\nboth wanting.\n\nFortunately Thalcave solved the difficulty. This guide, who was\naccustomed to conduct travelers along the Patagonian frontiers, and\nwas one of the most intelligent baqueanos of the country, engaged to\nfurnish Glenarvan all that his little party needed. He offered to take\nhim to a \"tolderia\" (encampment) of Indians, about four miles distant,\nwhere they would find everything necessary for the expedition. This\nproposal was made partly by gestures, partly by Spanish words which\nPaganel succeeded in understanding. It was accepted, and Glenarvan and\nhis learned friend, taking leave of their companions, reascended the\nstream under the guidance of the Patagonian.\n\nThey proceeded at a good pace for an hour and a half, taking long\nstrides to keep up to the giant Thalcave. All the region was charming,\nand of a rich fertility. The grassy pastures succeeded each other,\nand could easily have fed thousands of cattle. Large ponds, united by\na winding chain of streams, gave these plains a verdant moisture.\nBlack-headed swans sported on the mirror-like surface, and disputed the\nempire of the waters with numberless ostriches that gamboled over the\nplains, while the brilliant feathered tribes were in wonderful variety.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nJacques Paganel proceeded from admiration to ecstasy. Exclamations\nof delight continually escaped his lips, to the astonishment of the\nPatagonian, who thought it very natural that there should be birds in\nthe air, swans on the lakes, and grass on the prairies. The geographer\nhad no reason to regret his walk, or complain of its length. He\nscarcely believed himself started, or that the encampment would soon\ncome in sight.\n\nThis tolderia was at the bottom of a narrow valley among the mountains.\nHere in huts of branches lived thirty wandering natives, grazing\nlarge herds of milch cows, sheep, cattle and horses. Thus they roamed\nfrom one pasture to another, always finding a repast ready for their\nfour-footed companions.\n\n[Sidenote: GLENARVAN GOING TO MARKET.]\n\nThalcave took upon himself the negotiation, which was not long. In\nreturn for seven small Argentine horses, all saddled, a hundred pounds\nof dried meat, a few measures of rice, and some leathern bottles for\nwater, the Indians received twenty ounces of gold, the value of which\nthey perfectly understood. Glenarvan would have bought another horse\nfor the Patagonian, but he intimated that it was unnecessary.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe bargain concluded, Glenarvan took leave of his new \"providers,\" as\nPaganel expressed it, and returned to the encampment. His arrival was\nwelcomed by cries of joy at sight of the provisions and horses. Every\none ate with avidity. Robert partook of some nourishment; he had almost\nentirely regained his strength, and the remainder of the day was passed\nin perfect rest. Various subjects were alluded to: the absent dear\nones, the Duncan, Captain Mangles, his brave crew, and Harry Grant who\nwas, perhaps, not far distant.\n\nAs for Paganel, he did not leave the Indian. He became Thalcave's\nshadow, and could not remain quiet in the presence of a real\nPatagonian, in comparison with whom he would have passed for a dwarf.\nHe overwhelmed the grave Indian with Spanish phrases, to which the\nlatter quietly listened.

When it was seen that Danglars sold, the Spanish funds fell\ndirectly. Danglars lost five hundred thousand francs; but he rid\nhimself of all his Spanish shares. The same evening the following was\nread in _Le Messager_:\n\n“[By telegraph.] The king, Don Carlos, has escaped the vigilance of his\nguardians at Bourges, and has returned to Spain by the Catalonian\nfrontier. Barcelona has risen in his favor.”\n\nAll that evening nothing was spoken of but the foresight of Danglars,\nwho had sold his shares, and of the luck of the stock-jobber, who only\nlost five hundred thousand francs by such a blow. Those who had kept\ntheir shares, or bought those of Danglars, looked upon themselves as\nruined, and passed a very bad night. Next morning _Le Moniteur_\ncontained the following:\n\n“It was without any foundation that _Le Messager_ yesterday announced\nthe flight of Don Carlos and the revolt of Barcelona. The king (Don\nCarlos) has not left Bourges, and the peninsula is in the enjoyment of\nprofound peace. A telegraphic signal, improperly interpreted, owing to\nthe fog, was the cause of this error.”\n\nThe funds rose one per cent higher than before they had fallen. This,\nreckoning his loss, and what he had missed gaining, made the difference\nof a million to Danglars.\n\n“Good,” said Monte Cristo to Morrel, who was at his house when the news\narrived of the strange reverse of fortune of which Danglars had been\nthe victim, “I have just made a discovery for twenty-five thousand\nfrancs, for which I would have paid a hundred thousand.”\n\n“What have you discovered?” asked Morrel.\n\n“I have just discovered how a gardener may get rid of the dormice that\neat his peaches.”\n\n\n\n Chapter 62. Ghosts\n\nAt first sight, the exterior of the house at Auteuil gave no\nindications of splendor, nothing one would expect from the destined\nresidence of the magnificent Count of Monte Cristo; but this simplicity\nwas according to the will of its master, who positively ordered nothing\nto be altered outside. The splendor was within. Indeed, almost before\nthe door opened, the scene changed.\n\nM.

It is told that the Duc\nd’Antin removed in a single night a whole avenue of trees that annoyed\nLouis XIV.; in three days M. Bertuccio planted an entirely bare court\nwith poplars, large spreading sycamores to shade the different parts of\nthe house, and in the foreground, instead of the usual paving-stones,\nhalf hidden by the grass, there extended a lawn but that morning laid\ndown, and upon which the water was yet glistening. For the rest, the\norders had been issued by the count; he himself had given a plan to\nBertuccio, marking the spot where each tree was to be planted, and the\nshape and extent of the lawn which was to take the place of the\npaving-stones.\n\nThus the house had become unrecognizable, and Bertuccio himself\ndeclared that he scarcely knew it, encircled as it was by a framework\nof trees. The overseer would not have objected, while he was about it,\nto have made some improvements in the garden, but the count had\npositively forbidden it to be touched.

Noirtier was a true prophet, and things progressed rapidly, as he\nhad predicted. Everyone knows the history of the famous return from\nElba, a return which was unprecedented in the past, and will probably\nremain without a counterpart in the future.\n\nLouis XVIII. made but a faint attempt to parry this unexpected blow;\nthe monarchy he had scarcely reconstructed tottered on its precarious\nfoundation, and at a sign from the emperor the incongruous structure of\nancient prejudices and new ideas fell to the ground. Villefort,\ntherefore, gained nothing save the king’s gratitude (which was rather\nlikely to injure him at the present time) and the cross of the Legion\nof Honor, which he had the prudence not to wear, although M. de Blacas\nhad duly forwarded the brevet.\n\nNapoleon would, doubtless, have deprived Villefort of his office had it\nnot been for Noirtier, who was all powerful at court, and thus the\nGirondin of ’93 and the Senator of 1806 protected him who so lately had\nbeen his protector. All Villefort’s influence barely enabled him to\nstifle the secret Dantès had so nearly divulged. The king’s procureur\nalone was deprived of his office, being suspected of royalism.\n\nHowever, scarcely was the imperial power established—that is, scarcely\nhad the emperor re-entered the Tuileries and begun to issue orders from\nthe closet into which we have introduced our readers,—he found on the\ntable there Louis XVIII.’s half-filled snuff-box,—scarcely had this\noccurred when Marseilles began, in spite of the authorities, to\nrekindle the flames of civil war, always smouldering in the south, and\nit required but little to excite the populace to acts of far greater\nviolence than the shouts and insults with which they assailed the\nroyalists whenever they ventured abroad.\n\n0159m\n\n\n\nOwing to this change, the worthy shipowner became at that moment—we\nwill not say all powerful, because Morrel was a prudent and rather a\ntimid man, so much so, that many of the most zealous partisans of\nBonaparte accused him of “moderation”—but sufficiently influential to\nmake a demand in favor of Dantès.\n\nVillefort retained his place, but his marriage was put off until a more\nfavorable opportunity. If the emperor remained on the throne, Gérard\nrequired a different alliance to aid his career; if Louis XVIII.\nreturned, the influence of M. de Saint-Méran, like his own, could be\nvastly increased, and the marriage be still more suitable. The deputy\nprocureur was, therefore, the first magistrate of Marseilles, when one\nmorning his door opened, and M. Morrel was announced.\n\nAnyone else would have hastened to receive him; but Villefort was a man\nof ability, and he knew this would be a sign of weakness. He made\nMorrel wait in the antechamber, although he had no one with him, for\nthe simple reason that the king’s procureur always makes everyone wait,\nand after passing a quarter of an hour in reading the papers, he\nordered M. Morrel to be admitted.\n\nMorrel expected Villefort would be dejected; he found him as he had\nfound him six weeks before, calm, firm, and full of that glacial\npoliteness, that most insurmountable barrier which separates the\nwell-bred from the vulgar man.\n\nHe had entered Villefort’s office expecting that the magistrate would\ntremble at the sight of him; on the contrary, he felt a cold shudder\nall over him when he saw Villefort sitting there with his elbow on his\ndesk, and his head leaning on his hand. He stopped at the door;\nVillefort gazed at him as if he had some difficulty in recognizing him;\nthen, after a brief interval, during which the honest shipowner turned\nhis hat in his hands,\n\n“M. Morrel, I believe?” said Villefort.\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“Come nearer,” said the magistrate, with a patronizing wave of the\nhand, “and tell me to what circumstance I owe the honor of this visit.”\n\n“Do you not guess, monsieur?” asked Morrel.\n\n“Not in the least; but if I can serve you in any way I shall be\ndelighted.”\n", "label": "SUPPORT"}

I am hardly nineteen; I know nothing; I have no part to play.\nIf I obtain the situation I desire, I shall owe it to M. Morrel. Thus\nall my opinions—I will not say public, but private—are confined to\nthese three sentiments,—I love my father, I respect M. Morrel, and I\nadore Mercédès. This, sir, is all I can tell you, and you see how\nuninteresting it is.” As Dantès spoke, Villefort gazed at his ingenuous\nand open countenance, and recollected the words of Renée, who, without\nknowing who the culprit was, had besought his indulgence for him. With\nthe deputy’s knowledge of crime and criminals, every word the young man\nuttered convinced him more and more of his innocence. This lad, for he\nwas scarcely a man,—simple, natural, eloquent with that eloquence of\nthe heart never found when sought for; full of affection for everybody,\nbecause he was happy, and because happiness renders even the wicked\ngood—extended his affection even to his judge, spite of Villefort’s\nsevere look and stern accent. Dantès seemed full of kindness.\n\n_“Pardieu!”_ said Villefort, “he is a noble fellow. I hope I shall gain\nRenée’s favor easily by obeying the first command she ever imposed on\nme. I shall have at least a pressure of the hand in public, and a sweet\nkiss in private.” Full of this idea, Villefort’s face became so joyous,\nthat when he turned to Dantès, the latter, who had watched the change\non his physiognomy, was smiling also.\n\n“Sir,” said Villefort, “have you any enemies, at least, that you know.”\n\n“I have enemies?” replied Dantès; “my position is not sufficiently\nelevated for that. As for my disposition, that is, perhaps, somewhat\ntoo hasty; but I have striven to repress it. I have had ten or twelve\nsailors under me, and if you question them, they will tell you that\nthey love and respect me, not as a father, for I am too young, but as\nan elder brother.”\n\n“But you may have excited jealousy. You are about to become captain at\nnineteen—an elevated post; you are about to marry a pretty girl, who\nloves you; and these two pieces of good fortune may have excited the\nenvy of someone.”\n\n“You are right; you know men better than I do, and what you say may\npossibly be the case, I confess; but if such persons are among my\nacquaintances I prefer not to know it, because then I should be forced\nto hate them.”\n\n“You are wrong; you should always strive to see clearly around you. You\nseem a worthy young man; I will depart from the strict line of my duty\nto aid you in discovering the author of this accusation.

He looked first at Lord\nGlenarvan, always serious; then at Lady Helena and Miss Grant, whose\nfeatures expressed a sympathetic disappointment; and finally at Captain\nMangles, who was smiling, and the imperturbable major.

A waif, a broken spar, a piece of wood fashioned by the hand of\nman, might guide the Duncan to the scene of the shipwreck.

The learned geographer, profiting by the\ncircumstance, would have made use of the language which he had studied\nso conscientiously; but, to his great astonishment, he could not make\nhimself understood by the natives.\n\n\"The accent is what I need,\" said he.\n\n\"Let us go to the Custom-house,\" replied Glenarvan.\n\nThere they were informed by means of several English words, accompanied\nby expressive gestures, that the British consul resided at Concepcion.\nIt was only an hour's journey.

Farther off, in small pens, pigs and goats were\nconfined, and dogs ran about seeking their scanty sustenance. They were\nrather poorly kept, for animals that formed the Maori daily food.\n\nGlenarvan and his companions had taken in the whole at a glance.

Several\nEnglish words that passed their lips clearly indicated that they were\ndemanding immediate vengeance.\n\nIn the midst of these cries and threats, Lady Helena affected a\ncalmness that she could not feel in her heart. This courageous woman,\nin order that her husband's coolness might not forsake him, heroically\ncontrolled her emotions. Poor Mary Grant felt herself growing weak, and\nCaptain Mangles supported her, ready to die in her defence. The others\nendured this torrent of invectives in various ways, either indifferent\nlike the major, or increasingly annoyed like Paganel.\n\nGlenarvan, wishing to relieve Lady Helena from the assaults of these\nshrews, boldly approached Kai-Koumou, and, pointing to the hideous\nthrong, said:\n\n\"Drive them away!\"\n\nThe Maori chief gazed steadily at his prisoner without replying.

They kept always to the right of their line of\ndescent, sounding the smallest fissures, descending to the bottom of\nprecipices half filled with fragments of the mass; and more than one\ncame forth with his garments in shreds, his feet and hands lacerated,\nat the peril of his life.\n\n[Sidenote: A SLEEPLESS NIGHT.]\n\nAll this portion of the Andes, except a few inaccessible plateaus,\nwas carefully explored for many hours without one of these brave men\nthinking of rest. But it was a vain search. The child had not only\nfound death in the mountains, but also a tomb, the stone of which,\nmade of some enormous rock, was forever closed over him.\n\nTowards noon Glenarvan and his companions, bruised and exhausted, found\nthemselves again in the valley. The former was a prey to the most\nviolent grief. He scarcely spoke, and from his lips issued only these\nwords, broken by sighs,--\"I will not go; I will not go!\"\n\nEach understood this determination, and respected it.\n\n\"We will wait,\" said Paganel to the major and Tom Austin. \"Let us take\nsome rest, and recruit our strength.

The major chose a group of\nlofty carob-trees, under which was established a temporary encampment.\nA few blankets, the arms, a little dried meat, and some rice, was\nall that remained to the travelers. A stream, which flowed not far\noff, furnished water, still muddy from the effects of the avalanche.\nMulready kindled a fire on the grass, and soon presented to his master\na warm and comforting repast. But Glenarvan refused it, and remained\nstretched on his poncho in profound prostration.\n\nThus the day passed. Night came, clear and calm as the preceding. While\nhis companions lay motionless, although wakeful, Glenarvan reascended\nthe mountain. He listened closely, still hoping that a last cry might\nreach him. He ventured alone and afar, pressing his ear to the ground,\nlistening, restraining the beatings of his heart, and calling in a\nvoice of despair.\n\nThe whole night long he wandered on the mountain. Sometimes Paganel,\nsometimes the major, followed him, ready to help him on the slippery\nsummits, or on the edge of the chasms, where his rashness led him. But\nhis last efforts were fruitless; and to the cry of \"Robert!

Villefort violently unbuttoned his\ngreatcoat, which seemed to strangle him, and passing his livid hand\nacross his forehead, entered his study.\n\nThe night was cold and still; the family had all retired to rest but\nVillefort, who alone remained up, and worked till five o’clock in the\nmorning, reviewing the last interrogatories made the night before by\nthe examining magistrates, compiling the depositions of the witnesses,\nand putting the finishing stroke to the deed of accusation, which was\none of the most energetic and best conceived of any he had yet\ndelivered.\n\nThe next day, Monday, was the first sitting of the assizes. The morning\ndawned dull and gloomy, and Villefort saw the dim gray light shine upon\nthe lines he had traced in red ink. The magistrate had slept for a\nshort time while the lamp sent forth its final struggles; its\nflickerings awoke him, and he found his fingers as damp and purple as\nthough they had been dipped in blood.\n\nHe opened the window; a bright yellow streak crossed the sky, and\nseemed to divide in half the poplars, which stood out in black relief\non the horizon. In the clover-fields beyond the chestnut-trees, a lark\nwas mounting up to heaven, while pouring out her clear morning song.\nThe damps of the dew bathed the head of Villefort, and refreshed his\nmemory.\n\n“Today,” he said with an effort,—“today the man who holds the blade of\njustice must strike wherever there is guilt.”\n\nInvoluntarily his eyes wandered towards the window of Noirtier’s room,\nwhere he had seen him the preceding night. The curtain was drawn, and\nyet the image of his father was so vivid to his mind that he addressed\nthe closed window as though it had been open, and as if through the\nopening he had beheld the menacing old man.\n\n“Yes,” he murmured,—“yes, be satisfied.”\n\nHis head dropped upon his chest, and in this position he paced his\nstudy; then he threw himself, dressed as he was, upon a sofa, less to\nsleep than to rest his limbs, cramped with cold and study. By degrees\neveryone awoke. Villefort, from his study, heard the successive noises\nwhich accompany the life of a house,—the opening and shutting of doors,\nthe ringing of Madame de Villefort’s bell, to summon the waiting-maid,\nmingled with the first shouts of the child, who rose full of the\nenjoyment of his age. Villefort also rang; his new valet brought him\nthe papers, and with them a cup of chocolate.\n\n“What are you bringing me?” said he.\n\n“A cup of chocolate.”\n\n“I did not ask for it. Who has paid me this attention?”\n\n“My mistress, sir. She said you would have to speak a great deal in the\nmurder case, and that you should take something to keep up your\nstrength;” and the valet placed the cup on the table nearest to the\nsofa, which was, like all the rest, covered with papers.\n\nThe valet then left the room. Villefort looked for an instant with a\ngloomy expression, then, suddenly, taking it up with a nervous motion,\nhe swallowed its contents at one draught. It might have been thought\nthat he hoped the beverage would be mortal, and that he sought for\ndeath to deliver him from a duty which he would rather die than fulfil.\nHe then rose, and paced his room with a smile it would have been\nterrible to witness. The chocolate was inoffensive, for M. de Villefort\nfelt no effects.\n\nThe breakfast-hour arrived, but M. de Villefort was not at table. The\nvalet re-entered.\n\n“Madame de Villefort wishes to remind you, sir,” he said, “that eleven\no’clock has just struck, and that the trial commences at twelve.”\n\n“Well,” said Villefort, “what then?”\n\n“Madame de Villefort is dressed; she is quite ready, and w", "label": "CONTRADICT"}

They were Lord\nGlenarvan and his companions.\n\n[Sidenote: A TESTING TIME.]\n\nThe evening before, the little party, led astray by the dense fog, had\nencamped in the midst of a numerous tribe of natives. About midnight,\nthe travelers, surprised in their sleep, were made prisoners and\ncarried on board the canoe. They had not yet been maltreated, but had\ntried in vain to resist. Their arms and ammunition were in the hands of\nthe savages, and their own bullets would have quickly stretched them on\nthe earth had they attempted to escape.\n\nThey were not long in learning, by the aid of a few English words which\nthe natives used, that, being driven back by the British troops, they\nwere returning, vanquished and weakened, to the regions of the upper\nWaikato. Their chief, after an obstinate resistance, in which he lost\nhis principal warriors, was now on his way to rouse again the river\ntribes. He was called Kai-Koumou, a terrible name, which signified\nin the native language \"he who eats the limbs of his enemy.\" He was\nbrave and bold, but his cruelty equaled his bravery. No pity could be\nexpected from him. His name was well known to the English soldiers, and\na price had been set upon his head by the governor of New Zealand.\n\nThis terrible catastrophe had come upon Glenarvan just as he was\nabout reaching the long-desired harbor of Auckland, whence he would\nhave returned to his native country. Yet, looking at his calm and\npassionless countenance, you could not have divined the depth of his\nanguish, for in his present critical situation he did not betray the\nextent of his misfortunes. He felt that he ought to set an example of\nfortitude to his wife and his companions, as being the husband and\nchief. Moreover, he was ready to die first for the common safety, if\ncircumstances should require it.\n\n[Sidenote: CHIEFS, CIVILIZED AND UNCIVILIZED.]\n\nHis companions were worthy of him; they shared his noble thoughts, and\ntheir calm and haughty appearance would scarcely have intimated that\nthey were being carried away to captivity and suffering. By common\nconsent, at Glenarvan's suggestion, they had resolved to feign a proud\nindifference in the presence of the savages. It was the only way of\ninfluencing those fierce natures.\n\n[Illustration: A boat might have been seen ascending the Waikato. It\nwas a canoe seventy feet long and five broad.]\n\nSince leaving the encampment, the natives, taciturn like all savages,\nhad scarcely spoken to each other. However, from a few words exchanged,\nGlenarvan perceived that they were acquainted with the English\nlanguage. He therefore resolved to question the chief in regard to the\nfate that was in store for them. Addressing Kai-Koumou, he said, in a\nfearless tone:\n\n\"Where are you taking us, chief?\"\n\nKai-Koumou gazed at him coldly without answering.\n\n\"Say, what do you expect to do with us?\" continued Glenarvan.\n\nThe chief's eyes blazed with a sudden light, and in a stern voice he\nreplied:\n\n\"To exchange you, if your friends will ransom you; to kill you, if they\nrefuse.\"\n\nGlenarvan asked no more, but hope returned to his heart. Doubtless,\nsome chiefs of the Maori tribe had fallen into the hands of the\nEnglish, and the natives would attempt to recover them by way of\nexchange; their situation, therefore, was not one for despair.\n\nMeantime the canoe rapidly ascended the river.

Besides, Glenarvan thought it likely that Kai-Koumou's tribe\nhad lost some chief of high rank whom they were particularly anxious to\nrecover; and he was not mistaken.\n\nThe next day the canoe ascended the river with increased swiftness.\nIt stopped for a moment at the junction of a small river which wound\nacross the plains on the right bank. Here another canoe, with ten\nnatives on board, joined Kai-Koumou. The warriors merely exchanged\nsalutations, and then continued their course. The new-comers had\nrecently fought against the English troops, as could be seen by their\ntattered garments, their gory weapons, and the wounds that still bled\nbeneath their rags. They were gloomy and taciturn, and, with the\nindifference common to all savage races, paid no attention to the\ncaptives.\n\nTowards evening Kai-Koumou landed at the foot of the mountains,\nwhose nearer ridges reached precipitously to the river-bank. Here\ntwenty natives, who had disembarked from their canoes, were making\npreparations for the night. Fires blazed beneath the trees.

The\nprisoners were stationed in the centre of the encampment, and guarded\nwith extreme vigilance.\n\nThe next morning the ascent of the Waikato was resumed. Other boats\ncame from various affluents of the river. Sixty warriors, evidently\nfugitives from the last insurrection, had now assembled, and were\nreturning, more or less wounded in the fray, to the mountain districts.\nSometimes a song arose from the canoes, as they advanced in single\nfile. One native struck up the patriotic ode of the mysterious \"Pihé,\"\nthe national hymn that calls the Maoris to battle. The full and\nsonorous voice of the singer waked the echoes of the mountains; and\nafter each stanza his comrades struck their breasts, and sang the\nwarlike verses in chorus. Then they seized their oars again, and the\ncanoes were headed up stream.\n\nDuring the day a singular sight enlivened the voyage. About four\no'clock the canoe, without lessening its speed, guided by the steady\nhand of the chief, dashed through a narrow gorge. Eddies broke\nviolently against numerous small islands, which rendered navigation\nexceeding dangerous. Never could it be more hazardous to capsize, for\nthe banks afforded no refuge, and whoever had set foot on the porous\ncrust of the shore would probably have perished. At this point the\nriver flowed between warm springs, oxide of iron colored the muddy\nground a brilliant red, and not a yard of firm earth could be seen.\nThe air was heavy with a penetrating sulphureous odor. The natives did\nnot regard it, but the captives were seriously annoyed by the noxious\nvapors exhaled from the fissures of the soil and the bubbles that\nburst and discharged their gaseous contents. Yet, however disagreeable\nthese emanations were, the eye could not but admire this magnificent\nspectacle.\n\n[Illustration: At this point the river flowed between warm springs, and\nnot a yard of firm earth could be seen.]\n\nThe canoes soon after entered a dense cloud of white smoke, whose\nwreaths rose in gradually decreasing circles above the river.

It seemed as though some engineer was\ndirecting at his pleasure the outflowings of these springs, as the\nwaters and vapor, mingling in the air, formed rainbows in the sunbeams.\n\nFor two miles the canoes glided within this vapory atmosphere,\nenveloped in its warm waves that rolled along the surface of the water.\nThen the sulphureous smoke disappeared, and a pure swift current of\nfresh air refreshed the panting voyagers.

As\nfor the count, he had fallen on his chair; it was evident that his legs\nrefused to support him.\n\n“‘Madame,’ said the president, ‘you have engaged to furnish the\ncommittee with some important particulars respecting the affair at\nYanina, and you have stated that you were an eyewitness of the\nevent.’—‘I was, indeed,’ said the stranger, with a tone of sweet\nmelancholy, and with the sonorous voice peculiar to the East.\n\n“‘But allow me to say that you must have been very young then.’—‘I was\nfour years old; but as those events deeply concerned me, not a single\ndetail has escaped my memory.’—‘In what manner could these events\nconcern you? and who are you, that they should have made so deep an\nimpression on you?’—‘On them depended my father’s life,’ replied she.\n‘I am Haydée, the daughter of Ali Tepelini, pasha of Yanina, and of\nVasiliki, his beloved wife.’\n\n40202m\n\n\n\n“The blush of mingled pride and modesty which suddenly suffused the\ncheeks of the young woman, the brilliancy of her eye, and her highly\nimportant communication, produced an indescribable effect on the\nassembly. As for the count, he could not have been more overwhelmed if\na thunderbolt had fallen at his feet and opened an immense gulf before\nhim.\n\n“‘Madame,’ replied the president, bowing with profound respect, ‘allow\nme to ask one question; it shall be the last: Can you prove the\nauthenticity of what you have now stated?’\n\n“‘I can, sir,’ said Haydée, drawing from under her veil a satin satchel\nhighly perfumed; ‘for here is the register of my birth, signed by my\nfather and his principal officers, and that of my baptism, my father\nhaving consented to my being brought up in my mother’s faith,—this\nlatter has been sealed by the grand primate of Macedonia and Epirus;\nand lastly (and perhaps the most important), the record of the sale of\nmy person and that of my mother to the Armenian merchant El-Kobbir, by\nthe French officer, who, in his infamous bargain with the Porte, had\nreserved as his part of the booty the wife and daughter of his\nbenefactor, whom he sold for the sum of four hundred thousand francs.’\nA greenish pallor spread over the count’s cheeks, and his eyes became\nbloodshot at these terrible imputations, which were listened to by the\nassembly with ominous silence.\n\n“Haydée, still calm, but with a calmness more dreadful than the anger\nof another would have been, handed to the president the record of her\nsale, written in Arabic. It had been supposed some of the papers might\nbe in the Arabian, Romaic, or Turkish language, and the interpreter of\nthe House was in attendance. One of the noble peers, who was familiar\nwith the Arabic language, having studied it during the famous Egyptian\ncampaign, followed with his eye as the translator read aloud:\n\n“‘I, El-Kobbir, a slave-merchant, and purveyor of the harem of his\nhighness, acknowledge having received for transmission to the sublime\nemperor, from the French lord, the Count of Monte Cristo, an emerald\nvalued at eight hundred thousand francs; as the ransom of a young\nChristian slave of eleven years of age, named Haydée, the acknowledged\ndaughter of the late lord Ali Tepelini, pasha of Yanina, and of\nVasiliki, his favorite; she having been sold to me seven years\npreviously, with her mother, who had died on arriving at\nConstantinople, by a French colonel in the service of the Vizier Ali\nTepelini, named Fernand Mondego.

To prove to Noirtier\nthat he was in Valentine’s confidence and knew all their secrets,\nMorrel took the dictionary, a pen, and some paper, and placed them all\non a table where there was a light.\n\n“But first,” said Morrel, “allow me, sir, to tell you who I am, how\nmuch I love Mademoiselle Valentine, and what are my designs respecting\nher.”\n\nNoirtier made a sign that he would listen.\n\nIt was an imposing sight to witness this old man, apparently a mere\nuseless burden, becoming the sole protector, support, and adviser of\nthe lovers who were both young, beautiful, and strong. His remarkably\nnoble and austere expression struck Morrel, who began his story with\ntrembling. He related the manner in which he had become acquainted with\nValentine, and how he had loved her, and that Valentine, in her\nsolitude and her misfortune, had accepted the offer of his devotion. He\ntold him his birth, his position, his fortune, and more than once, when\nhe consulted the look of the paralytic, that look answered, “That is\ngood, proceed.”\n\n“And now,” said Morrel, when he had finished the first part of his\nrecital, “now I have told you of my love and my hopes, may I inform you\nof my intentions?”\n\n“Yes,” signified the old man.\n\n“This was our resolution; a cabriolet was in waiting at the gate, in\nwhich I intended to carry off Valentine to my sister’s house, to marry\nher, and to wait respectfully M. de Villefort’s pardon.”\n\n“No,” said Noirtier.\n\n“We must not do so?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“You do not sanction our project?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“There is another way,” said Morrel. The old man’s interrogative eye\nsaid, “Which?”\n\n“I will go,” continued Maximilian, “I will seek M. Franz d’Épinay—I am\nhappy to be able to mention this in Mademoiselle de Villefort’s\nabsence—and will conduct myself toward him so as to compel him to\nchallenge me.” Noirtier’s look continued to interrogate.\n\n“You wish to know what I will do?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“I will find him, as I told you. I will tell him the ties which bind me\nto Mademoiselle Valentine; if he be a sensible man, he will prove it by\nrenouncing of his own accord the hand of his betrothed, and will secure\nmy friendship, and love until death; if he refuse, either through\ninterest or ridiculous pride, after I have proved to him that he would\nbe forcing my wife from me, that Valentine loves me, and will have no\nother, I will fight with him, give him every advantage, and I shall\nkill him, or he will kill me; if I am victorious, he will not marry\nValentine, and if I die, I am very sure Valentine will not marry him.”\n\nNoirtier watched, with indescribable pleasure, this noble and sincere\ncountenance, on which every sentiment his tongue uttered was depicted,\nadding by the expression of his fine features all that coloring adds to\na sound and faithful drawing.\n\nStill, when Morrel had finished, he shut his eyes several times, which\nwa", "label": "SUPPORT"}

So life went on for\nthem as it does for those who are not victims of misfortune and whose\nactivities glide along mechanically and tranquilly beneath the eye of\nProvidence.\n\nBut beneath this superficial calm there were in the heart of the young\nman, and perhaps in that of the old man, many repressed desires, many\nstifled sighs, which found vent when Faria was left alone, and when\nEdmond returned to his cell.\n\nOne night Edmond awoke suddenly, believing that he heard someone\ncalling him. He opened his eyes upon utter darkness. His name, or\nrather a plaintive voice which essayed to pronounce his name, reached\nhim. He sat up in bed and a cold sweat broke out upon his brow.\nUndoubtedly the call came from Faria’s dungeon.\n\n“Alas,” murmured Edmond; “can it be?”\n\nHe moved his bed, drew up the stone, rushed into the passage, and\nreached the opposite extremity; the secret entrance was open. By the\nlight of the wretched and wavering lamp, of which we have spoken,\nDantès saw the old man, pale, but yet erect, clinging to the bedstead.\nHis features were writhing with those horrible symptoms which he\nalready knew, and which had so seriously alarmed him when he saw them\nfor the first time.\n\n“Alas, my dear friend,” said Faria in a resigned tone, “you understand,\ndo you not, and I need not attempt to explain to you?”\n\nEdmond uttered a cry of agony, and, quite out of his senses, rushed\ntowards the door, exclaiming, “Help, help!”\n\nFaria had just sufficient strength to restrain him.\n\n“Silence,” he said, “or you are lost.

It would require years to do again what I have done\nhere, and the results would be instantly destroyed if our jailers knew\nwe had communicated with each other. Besides, be assured, my dear\nEdmond, the dungeon I am about to leave will not long remain empty;\nsome other unfortunate being will soon take my place, and to him you\nwill appear like an angel of salvation.

At length Providence\nhas done something for you; he restores to you more than he takes away,\nand it was time I should die.”\n\nEdmond could only clasp his hands and exclaim, “Oh, my friend, my\nfriend, speak not thus!” and then resuming all his presence of mind,\nwhich had for a moment staggered under this blow, and his strength,\nwhich had failed at the words of the old man, he said, “Oh, I have\nsaved you once, and I will save you a second time!” And raising the\nfoot of the bed, he drew out the phial, still a third filled with the\nred liquor.\n\n“See,” he exclaimed, “there remains still some of the magic draught.\nQuick, quick! tell me what I must do this time; are there any fresh\ninstructions?

Valentine had raised herself upon her elbow, and had scarcely\ntime to throw herself down on the bed and shade her eyes with her arm;\nthen, trembling, agitated, and her heart beating with indescribable\nterror, she awaited the event.\n\nSomeone approached the bed and drew back the curtains. Valentine\nsummoned every effort, and breathed with that regular respiration which\nannounces tranquil sleep.\n\n“Valentine!” said a low voice.\n\nThe girl shuddered to the heart but did not reply.\n\n“Valentine,” repeated the same voice.\n\nStill silent: Valentine had promised not to wake. Then everything was\nstill, excepting that Valentine heard the almost noiseless sound of\nsome liquid being poured into the glass she had just emptied. Then she\nventured to open her eyelids, and glance over her extended arm. She saw\na woman in a white dressing-gown pouring a liquor from a phial into her\nglass. During this short time Valentine must have held her breath, or\nmoved in some slight degree, for the woman, disturbed, stopped and\nleaned over the bed, in order the better to ascertain whether Valentine\nslept: it was Madame de Villefort.\n\nOn recognizing her step-mother, Valentine could not repress a shudder,\nwhich caused a vibration in the bed. Madame de Villefort instantly\nstepped back close to the wall, and there, shaded by the bed-curtains,\nshe silently and attentively watched the slightest movement of\nValentine. The latter recollected the terrible caution of Monte Cristo;\nshe fancied that the hand not holding the phial clasped a long sharp\nknife. Then collecting all her remaining strength, she forced herself\nto close her eyes; but this simple operation upon the most delicate\norgans of our frame, generally so easy to accomplish, became almost\nimpossible at this moment, so much did curiosity struggle to retain the\neyelid open and learn the truth. Madame de Villefort, however,\nreassured by the silence, which was alone disturbed by the regular\nbreathing of Valentine, again extended her hand, and half hidden by the\ncurtains succeeded in emptying the contents of the phial into the\nglass. Then she retired so gently that Valentine did not know she had\nleft the room. She only witnessed the withdrawal of the arm—the fair\nround arm of a woman but twenty-five years old, and who yet spread\ndeath around her.\n\n50077m\n\n\n\nIt is impossible to describe the sensations experienced by Valentine\nduring the minute and a half Madame de Villefort remained in the room.\n\nThe grating against the library-door aroused the young girl from the\nstupor in which she was plunged, and which almost amounted to\ninsensibility. She raised her head with an effort. The noiseless door\nagain turned on its hinges, and the Count of Monte Cristo reappeared.\n\n“Well,” said he, “do you still doubt?”\n\n“Oh,” murmured the young girl.\n\n“Have you seen?”\n\n“Alas!”\n\n“Did you recognize?” Valentine groaned.\n\n“Oh, yes;” she said, “I saw, but I cannot believe!”\n\n“Would you rather die, then, and cause Maximilian’s death?”\n\n“Oh,” repeated the young girl, almost bewildered, “can I not leave the\nhouse?—can I not escape?”\n\n“Valentine, the hand which now threatens you will pursue you\neverywhere; your servants will be seduced with gold, and death will be\noffered to you disguised in every shape.

I really must pray you to excuse me, but—in\ntruth—I was not attending to the conversation.”\n\n“Marquise, marquise!” interposed the old nobleman who had proposed the\ntoast, “let the young people alone; let me tell you, on one’s wedding\nday there are more agreeable subjects of conversation than dry\npolitics.”\n\n“Never mind, dearest mother,” said a young and lovely girl, with a\nprofusion of light brown hair, and eyes that seemed to float in liquid\ncrystal, “’tis all my fault for seizing upon M. de Villefort, so as to\nprevent his listening to what you said. But there—now take him—he is\nyour own for as long as you like. M. Villefort, I beg to remind you my\nmother speaks to you.”\n\n“If the marquise will deign to repeat the words I but imperfectly\ncaught, I shall be delighted to answer,” said M. de Villefort.\n\n“Never mind, Renée,” replied the marquise, with a look of tenderness\nthat seemed out of keeping with her harsh dry features; but, however\nall other feelings may be withered in a woman’s nature, there is always\none bright smiling spot in the desert of her heart, and that is the\nshrine of maternal love. “I forgive you. What I was saying, Villefort,\nwas, that the Bonapartists had not our sincerity, enthusiasm, or\ndevotion.”\n\n“They had, however, what supplied the place of those fine qualities,”\nreplied the young man, “and that was fanaticism. Napoleon is the\nMahomet of the West, and is worshipped by his commonplace but ambitious\nfollowers, not only as a leader and lawgiver, but also as the\npersonification of equality.”\n\n“He!” cried the marquise: “Napoleon the type of equality! For mercy’s\nsake, then, what would you call Robespierre? Come, come, do not strip\nthe latter of his just rights to bestow them on the Corsican, who, to\nmy mind, has usurped quite enough.”\n\n0085m\n\n\n\n“Nay, madame; I would place each of these heroes on his right\npedestal—that of Robespierre on his scaffold in the Place Louis Quinze;\nthat of Napoleon on the column of the Place Vendôme. The only\ndifference consists in the opposite character of the equality advocated\nby these two men; one is the equality that elevates, the other is the\nequality that degrades; one brings a king within reach of the\nguillotine, the other elevates the people to a level with the throne.\nObserve,” said Villefort, smiling, “I do not mean to deny that both\nthese men were revolutionary scoundrels, and that the 9th Thermidor and\nthe 4th of April, in the year 1814, were lucky days for France, worthy\nof being gratefully remembered by every friend to monarchy and civil\norder; and that explains how it comes to pass that, fallen, as I trust\nhe is forever, Napoleon has still retained a train of parasitical\nsatellites. Still, marquise, it has been so with other\nusurpers—Cromwell, for instance, who was not half so bad as Napoleon,\nhad his partisans and advocates.”\n\n“Do you know, Villefort, that you are talking in a most dreadfully\nrevolutionary strain? But I excuse it, it is impossible to expect the\nson of a Girondin to be free from a small spice of the old leaven.” A\ndeep crimson suffused the countenance of Villefort.\n\n“’Tis true, madame,” answered he, “that my father was a Girondin, but\nhe was not among the number of those who voted for the king’s death; he\nwas an equal sufferer with yourself during the Reign of Terror, and had\nwell-nigh lost his head on the same scaffold on which your father\nperished.”\n\n“True,” replied the marquise, without wincing in the slightest degree\nat the tragic remembrance thus called up; “but bear in mind, if you\nplease, that our respective parents underwent persecution and\nproscription from diametrically opposite principles; in proof of which\nI may remark, that while my family remained among the staunchest\nadherents of the exiled princes, your father lost no time in joining\nthe new government; and that while the Citizen Noirtier was a Girondin,\nthe Count Noirtier became a senator.”\n\n“Dear mother,” interposed Renée, “you know very well it was agreed that\nall these", "label": "SUPPORT"}

He waited in\nan attitude full of dignity, and, seeing him so motionless and stern on\nhis pedestal of rocks, you would have taken him for a statue.\n\nThe major, as soon as he perceived him, pointed him out to Glenarvan,\nwho hastened towards him. The Patagonian took two steps forward;\nGlenarvan took his hand, and pressed it. There was in the latter's\nlook, in his physiognomy, such a feeling, such an expression of\ngratitude, that the native could not mistake it. He inclined his head\ngently, and uttered a few words that neither the major nor his friend\ncould understand.\n\nThe Patagonian, after regarding the strangers attentively, now changed\nthe language; but whatever it was, this new idiom was no better\nunderstood than the first. However, certain expressions which he used\nstruck Glenarvan.

And pronouncing with\nmagisterial slowness, he uttered these words,--\n\n\"A--Patagonian,--doubtless?\"\n\nThe native remained mute as before.\n\n\"Answer!\" added Paganel.\n\nThe Patagonian did not reply.\n\n\"Do--you--understand?\" cried Paganel, violently enough to damage his\norgans of speech.\n\nIt was evident that the Indian did not understand, for he answered, but\nin Spanish,--\n\n\"I do not understand.\"\n\nIt was Paganel's turn now to be astonished, and he hastily put on his\nglasses, like one irritated.\n\n\"May I be hanged,\" said he, \"if I understand a word of this infernal\njargon! It is certainly Araucanian.\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Glenarvan; \"this man answered in Spanish.\"\n\nAnd, turning to the Patagonian, he repeated,--\n\n\"Spanish?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the native.\n\nPaganel's surprise became amazement. The major and Glenarvan looked at\nhim quizzingly.\n\n\"Ah, my learned friend!\" said the major, while a half smile played\nabout his lips, \"you have committed one of those blunders peculiar to\nyou.\"\n\n\"What!\" cried the geographer, starting.\n\n\"Yes, it is plain that this Patagonian speaks Spanish.\"\n\n\"He?\"\n\n[Illustration: A man of lofty stature was standing, motionless, on\none of the first ledges of the mountain.

The 14th of October was fixed for the day of\ndeparture.\n\nWhen they came to choose the sailors who were to go, they all offered\ntheir services, and Glenarvan was forced to make a choice.

But there—now take him—he is\nyour own for as long as you like. M.

What I was saying, Villefort,\nwas, that the Bonapartists had not our sincerity, enthusiasm, or\ndevotion.”\n\n“They had, however, what supplied the place of those fine qualities,”\nreplied the young man, “and that was fanaticism. Napoleon is the\nMahomet of the West, and is worshipped by his commonplace but ambitious\nfollowers, not only as a leader and lawgiver, but also as the\npersonification of equality.”\n\n“He!” cried the marquise: “Napoleon the type of equality!

Still, marquise, it has been so with other\nusurpers—Cromwell, for instance, who was not half so bad as Napoleon,\nhad his partisans and advocates.”\n\n“Do you know, Villefort, that you are talking in a most dreadfully\nrevolutionary strain? But I excuse it, it is impossible to expect the\nson of a Girondin to be free from a small spice of the old leaven.” A\ndeep crimson suffused the countenance of Villefort.\n\n“’Tis true, madame,” answered he, “that my father was a Girondin, but\nhe was not among the number of those who voted for the king’s death; he\nwas an equal sufferer with yourself during the Reign of Terror, and had\nwell-nigh lost his head on the same scaffold on which your father\nperished.”\n\n“True,” replied the marquise, without wincing in the slightest degree\nat the tragic remembrance thus called up; “but bear in mind, if you\nplease, that our respective parents underwent persecution and\nproscription from diametrically opposite principles; in proof of which\nI may remark, that while my family remained among the staunchest\nadherents of the exiled princes, your father lost no time in joining\nthe new government; and that while the Citizen Noirtier was a Girondin,\nthe Count Noirtier became a senator.”\n\n“Dear mother,” interposed Renée, “you know very well it was agreed that\nall these", "label": "SUPPORT"}

The major chose a group of\nlofty carob-trees, under which was established a temporary encampment.\nA few blankets, the arms, a little dried meat, and some rice, was\nall that remained to the travelers. A stream, which flowed not far\noff, furnished water, still muddy from the effects of the avalanche.\nMulready kindled a fire on the grass, and soon presented to his master\na warm and comforting repast. But Glenarvan refused it, and remained\nstretched on his poncho in profound prostration.\n\nThus the day passed. Night came, clear and calm as the preceding. While\nhis companions lay motionless, although wakeful, Glenarvan reascended\nthe mountain. He listened closely, still hoping that a last cry might\nreach him. He ventured alone and afar, pressing his ear to the ground,\nlistening, restraining the beatings of his heart, and calling in a\nvoice of despair.\n\nThe whole night long he wandered on the mountain. Sometimes Paganel,\nsometimes the major, followed him, ready to help him on the slippery\nsummits, or on the edge of the chasms, where his rashness led him.

Paganel was\nfar from being insensible to Miss Arabella's attractions, yet did not\ndare to declare his sentiments. The major accordingly undertook the\npart of Cupid's messenger between these two congenial hearts, and even\ntold Paganel that marriage was \"the last blunder\" that he could commit.\nBut the geographer was very much embarrassed, and, strangely enough,\ncould not summon courage to speak for himself.\n\n[Illustration: Early in the afternoon the travelers reached Malcolm\nCastle, amidst the hurrahs of their tenantry and friends.]\n\n\"Does not Miss Arabella please you?\" MacNabb would say to him.\n\n\"Oh, major, she is charming!\" cried Paganel,--\"a thousand times too\ncharming for me; and, if I must tell you, would please me better if she\nwere less so.

About four o'clock the dogs started a troop of these\ncurious animals. The little ones took refuge in their mothers' pouches,\nand the whole drove rushed away in single file. Nothing can be more\nastonishing than the enormous bounds of the kangaroo, whose hind legs\nare twice as long as its fore ones, and bend like a spring.

The kangaroos\ndid not slacken their pace; and the dogs, who feared, with good reason,\nthe powerful blows of their formidable paws, did not venture to\napproach them. But at last the drove stopped in exhaustion, and \"the\nold man\" braced himself against the trunk of a tree, ready to fight\nfor his life. One of the pointers, carried on by the impetus of his\ncourse, rolled within reach of him. A moment after, the unfortunate\ndog was tossed into the air, and fell back lifeless.

He could not be mistaken.\n\n\"A piano in the desert!\" said he to himself. \"It cannot be!\"\n\nIt was indeed very surprising, and Paganel began to think that some\nstrange Australian bird was imitating the sound of the instrument.\n\n[Sidenote: A TWOFOLD SURPRISE.]\n\nBut at that moment a voice, harmoniously pitched, was heard. The\npianist was accompanied by a vocalist. The geographer listened\nincredulously, but in a few moments was forced to recognize the\nsublime air that struck upon his ear. It was \"_Il mio tesoro tanto_\"\nfrom Don Juan.\n\n[Illustration: Paganel did not lie down, but, rifle on shoulder,\nguarded the encampment, walking to and fro that he might the better\nresist sleep.]\n\n\"Parbleu!\" thought the geographer, \"however strange the Australian\nbirds may be, or even though the parrots were the most musical in the\nworld, they could not sing Mozart.\"\n\nHe listened to the end of this grand inspiration of the master. The\neffect of this sweet melody, in the stillness of the starlit night,\nwas indescribable. He remained a long time under the influences of its\nenchantment. At last the voice ceased, and all was silent.\n\nWhen Wilson came to relieve the geographer, he found him wrapt in a\nprofound reverie. Paganel said nothing to the sailor, but, reserving\nhis account of the incident for Glenarvan the next day, he crept into\nthe tent.\n\nIn the morning the whole party were awakened by unexpected bayings.\nGlenarvan at once arose. Two magnificent pointers were gamboling along\nthe edge of a small wood; but at the approach of the travelers they\ndisappeared among the trees, barking loudly.\n\n\"There must be a station in this desert,\" said Glenarvan, \"and hunters,\nsince those are hunting-dogs.\"\n\nPaganel was just about to relate his experiences of the past night,\nwhen two men appeared, in hunting costume, mounted on fine horses. They\nnaturally stopped at sight of the little party, encamped in gypsy-like\nfashion, and seemed to be wondering what the presence of armed men in\nthis place meant, when they perceived the ladies, who were alighting\nfrom the cart.\n\nThey immediately dismounted, and advanced towards them, hat in hand.\nGlenarvan went to meet them, and introduced himself and party, giving\nthe name and rank of each member. The young men bowed, and one of them,\nthe elder, said:\n\n\"My lord, will your ladies, your companions, and yourself do us the\nhonor to accompany us to our house?\"\n\n\"May I ask, gentlemen, whom I have the honor of addressing?\" inquired\nGlenarvan.\n\n\"Michael and Alexander Patterson, proprietors of Hottam Station. You\nare already on the grounds of the establishment, and have but a quarter\nof a mile to go.\"\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" replied Glenarvan, \"I should be unwilling to slight a\nhospitality so graciously offered----\"\n\n\"My lord,\" interrupted Michael Patterson, \"by accepting you will confer\na favor upon two poor colonists, who will be only too happy to extend\nto you the honors of the desert.\"\n\nGlenarvan bowed in token of assent.\n\n\"Sir,\" said Paganel, addressing Michael Patterson, \"should I be too\ninquisitive were I to ask if it was you who sang that divine air of\nMozart last night?\"\n\n\"It was I, sir,\" replied the gentleman; \"and my brother ", "label": "NEUTRAL"}

Glenarvan, a\nprey to unspeakable emotion, did not venture a word; while the major\nnodded his head with an air of genuine satisfaction.\n\n\"And now, my friends,\" said Paganel, \"if these brutes expect us to test\ntheir patience they are mistaken. In two days we shall be beyond the\nreach of these rascals.\"\n\n\"We will escape!\" said Glenarvan; \"but how?\"\n\n\"I do not know,\" replied Paganel, \"but we will do so all the same.\"\n\nAll now wished to hear the geographer's adventures. Strangely enough,\nin the case of a man loquacious usually, it was necessary to draw,\nas it were, the words from his mouth. He, who was so fond of telling\nstories, replied only in an evasive way to the questions of his friends.\n\n\"Paganel has changed,\" thought MacNabb.\n\n[Sidenote: THE WORTH OF SPECTACLES.]\n\nIndeed, the countenance of the geographer was no longer the same. He\nwrapped himself gloomily in his great flaxen mantle, and seemed to shun\ntoo inquisitive looks. However, when they were all seated around him at\nthe foot of the tomb, he related his experiences.\n\nAfter the death of Kara-Tété, Paganel had taken advantage, like Robert,\nof the confusion of the natives, and escaped from the pah. But less\nfortunate than young Grant, he had fallen upon an encampment of Maoris,\nwho were commanded by a chief of fine form and intelligent appearance,\nwho was evidently superior to all the warriors of his tribe. This chief\nspoke English accurately, and bade him welcome by rubbing his nose\nagainst that of the geographer. Paganel wondered whether he should\nconsider himself a prisoner; but seeing that he could not take a step\nwithout being graciously accompanied by the chief, he soon knew how\nmatters stood on this point.\n\nThe chief, whose name was \"Hihy\" (sunbeam), was not a bad man. The\nspectacles and telescope gave him a high opinion of Paganel, whom he\nattached carefully to his person, not only by his benefits, but by\nstrong flaxen ropes, especially at night.\n\nThis novel situation lasted three long days. Was he well or badly\ntreated? Both, as he stated without further explanation. In short, he\nwas a prisoner, and, except for the prospect of immediate torture,\nhis condition did not seem more enviable than that of his unfortunate\nfriends.\n\nFortunately, last night he succeeded in biting asunder his ropes and\nescaping. He had witnessed at a distance the burial of the chief,\nknew that he had been interred on the summit of Maunganamu mountain,\nand that it was tabooed in consequence. He therefore resolved to take\nrefuge there, not wishing to leave the place where his companions were\nheld captives. He succeeded in his undertaking, arrived at Kara-Tété's\ntomb, and waited in hope that Providence would in some way deliver his\nfriends.\n\nSuch was Paganel's story. Did he omit designedly any circumstance\nof his stay among the natives? More than once his embarrassment led\nthem to suspect so. However that might be, he received unanimous\ncongratulations; and as the past was now known, they returned to the\npresent.\n\nTheir situation was still exceedingly critical. The natives, if they\ndid not venture to climb the mountain, expected that hunger and thirst\nwould force their prisoners to surrender. It was only a matter of time,\nand the savages had great patience. Glenarvan did not disregard the\ndifficulties of his position, but waited for the favorable issue which\nProvidence seemed to promise.\n\nAnd first he wished to examine this improvised fortress; not to defend\nit, for an attack was not to be feared, but that he might find a way of\nescaping. The major and the captain, Robert, Paganel, and himself, took\nthe exact bearings of the mountain. They observed the direction of the\npaths, their branches and declivities.

Olbinett, however, narrowly escaped a serious\nscalding, for, just as he had dug a hole to put his roots in, a stream\nof watery vapor burst forth, and rose to the height of several feet.\nThe steward started back in terror.\n\n\"Close the hole!\" cried the major, who, with the aid of the two\nsailors, covered the orifice with fragments of pumice-stone, while\nPaganel murmured these words:\n\n\"Well! well! ha! ha! very natural!\"\n\n\"You are not scalded?\" inquired MacNabb of Olbinett.\n\n\"No, Mr. MacNabb,\" replied the steward; \"but I scarcely expected----\"\n\n\"So many blessings,\" added Paganel, in a mirthful tone. \"Consider\nKara-Tété's water and provisions, and the fire of the earth! This\nmountain is a paradise! I propose that we found a colony here,\ncultivate the soil, and settle for the rest of our days. We will\nbe Robinson Crusoes of Maunganamu. Indeed, I look in vain for any\ndeficiency on this comfortable peak.\"\n\n\"Nothing is wanting if the earth is firm,\" replied Captain Mangles.\n\n\"Well, it was not created yesterday,\" said Paganel. \"It has long\nresisted the action of internal fires, and will easily hold out till\nour departure.\"\n\n\"Breakfast is ready,\" announced Mr. Olbinett, as gravely as if he had\nbeen performing his duties at Malcolm Castle.\n\nThe fugitives at once sat down near the palisade, and enjoyed the\nrepast that Providence had so opportunely furnished to them in this\ncritical situation. No one appeared particular about the choice of\nfood, but there was a diversity of opinion concerning the edible\nferns. Some found them sweet and pleasant, and others mucilaginous,\ninsipid, and acrid. The sweet potatoes, cooked in the hot earth, were\nexcellent.\n\n[Illustration: The steward started back in terror.]\n\nTheir hunger being satiated, Glenarvan proposed that they should,\nwithout delay, arrange a plan of escape.\n\n\"So soon!\" said Paganel, in a truly piteous tone. \"What! are you\nthinking already of leaving this delightful place?\"\n\n\"I think, first of all,\" replied Glenarvan, \"that we ought to attempt\nan escape before we are forced to it by hunger. We have strength enough\nyet, and must take advantage of it. To-night let us try to gain the\neastern valleys, and cross the circle of natives under cover of the\ndarkness.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" answered Paganel; \"if the Maoris will let us pass.\"\n\n\"And if they prevent us?\" asked Captain Mangles.\n\n\"Then we will employ the great expedients,\" said Paganel.\n\n\"You have great expedients, then?\" inquired the major.\n\n\"More than I know what to do with,\" rejoined Paganel, without further\nexplanation.\n\nThey could now do nothing but wait for night to attempt crossing\nthe line of savages, who had not left their position. Their ranks\neven seemed increased by stragglers from the tribe. Here and there\nfreshly-kindled fires formed a flaming girdle around the base of the\npeak. When darkness had invaded the surrounding valleys, the Maunganamu\nseemed to rise from a vast conflagration, while its summit was lost in\na dense shade. Six hundred feet below were heard the tumult and cries\nof the enemy's camp.\n\nAt nine o'clock it was very dark, and Glenarvan and Captain Mangles\nresolved to make an exploration before taking their companions on\nthis perilous journey. They noiselessly descended the declivity some\ndistance, and reached the narrow ridge that crossed the line of natives\nfifty feet above the encampment.\n\n[Sidenote: ANOTHER SUNRISE.]\n\nAll went well so far. The Maoris, stretched beside their fires, did not\nseem to perceive the two fugitives, who advanced a few paces farther.\nBut suddenly, to the left and right of the ridge, a double volley\nresounded.\n\n\"Back!\" cried Glenarvan; \"these bandits have eyes like a cat, and the\nguns of riflemen!\"\n\nCaptain Mangles and he reascended at once the precipitous slopes of the\nmountain, and speedily assured their terrified friends of their safety.\nGlenarvan's hat had been pierced by two bullets.

If any unforeseen event should compel\nus to return to Melbourne, we might be sorry not to find the Duncan\nthere. Moreover, her injuries cannot yet have been repaired. I think,\ntherefore, that it would be better to wait.\"\n\n\"Well,\" replied Ayrton, without further remark.\n\nThe next day the little party, armed and ready for any emergency, left\nSeymour, and half an hour after re-entered the forest of eucalyptuses,\nwhich appeared again towards the east. Glenarvan would have preferred\nto travel in the open country, for a plain is less favorable to sudden\nattacks and ambuscades than a thick wood. But they had no alternative;\nand the cart kept on all day between the tall, monotonous trees, and at\nevening encamped on the borders of the district of Murray.\n\nThey were now setting foot on one of the least frequented portions of\nthe Australian continent, a vast uninhabited region stretching away to\nthe Australian Alps. At some future day its forests will be leveled,\nand the home of the colonist will stand where now all is desolation;\nbut at present it is a desert. In this region is situated the so-styled\n\"reserve for the blacks.\" On these remote plains various spots have\nbeen set apart, where the aboriginal race can enjoy to the full the\nprivilege of gradually becoming extinct. Though the white man is at\nperfect liberty to invade this \"reserved\" territory, yet the black may\ncall it his own.\n\nPaganel, who was in his element wherever statistics or history was\nconcerned, went into full details respecting the native races. He gave\na long account of the cruelties to which these unfortunate beings\nhad been subjected at the hands of the early colonists, and showed\nhow little had been done by the interference of the government. As\na striking instance of the manner in which the aborigines melt away\nbefore the advance of civilization, he cited the case of Tasmania,\nwhich at the beginning of this century had five thousand native\ninhabitants, but in 1863 had only seven.\n\n[Sidenote: STUDIES IN ANTHROPOLOGY.]\n\n\"Fifty years ago,\" said he, \"we should have met in our course many\na tribe of natives; whereas thus far we have not seen even one. A\ncentury hence, the black race will have utterly disappeared from this\ncontinent.\"\n\nAt that moment Robert, halting in front of a group of eucalyptuses,\ncried out:\n\n\"A monkey! there is a monkey!\"\n\nThe cart was instantly stopped, and, looking in the direction\nindicated by the boy, our travellers saw a huge black form moving with\nastonishing agility from branch to branch, until it was lost from view\nin the depths of the grove.\n\n\"What sort of a monkey is that?\" asked MacNabb.\n\n\"That monkey,\" answered Paganel, \"is a full-blooded Australian.\"\n\nJust then were heard sounds of voices at some little distance; the oxen\nwere put in motion, and after proceeding a few hundred paces the party\ncame suddenly upon an encampment of aborigines, consisting of some\nten or twelve tents, made of strips of bark arranged in the manner of\ntiles, and giving shelter to their wretched inhabitants on only one\nside. Of these miserable beings there were about thirty, men, women,\nand children, dressed in ragged kangaroo-skins. Their first movement\nwas one of flight; but a few words from Ayrton restored confidence, and\nthey slowly approached the party of Europeans.\n\nThe major jocularly insisted that Robert was correct in saying that\nhe had seen a monkey; but Lady Helena declined to accept his views,\nand, getting out of the cart, made friendly advances to these degraded\nbeings, who seemed ", "label": "NEUTRAL"}

Then, smiling, he went and gathered on the banks\nof the stream a few handfuls of wild celery, with which he rubbed the\nboy's body. Under this treatment, performed with an extreme gentleness,\nthe child felt his strength revive, and it was plain that a few hours\nwould suffice to restore him.\n\nIt was therefore decided that that day and the following night should\nbe passed at the encampment. Besides, two important questions remained\nto be settled--food, and means of conveyance. Provisions and mules were\nboth wanting.\n\nFortunately Thalcave solved the difficulty. This guide, who was\naccustomed to conduct travelers along the Patagonian frontiers, and\nwas one of the most intelligent baqueanos of the country, engaged to\nfurnish Glenarvan all that his little party needed. He offered to take\nhim to a \"tolderia\" (encampment) of Indians, about four miles distant,\nwhere they would find everything necessary for the expedition. This\nproposal was made partly by gestures, partly by Spanish words which\nPaganel succeeded in understanding. It was accepted, and Glenarvan and\nhis learned friend, taking leave of their companions, reascended the\nstream under the guidance of the Patagonian.\n\nThey proceeded at a good pace for an hour and a half, taking long\nstrides to keep up to the giant Thalcave. All the region was charming,\nand of a rich fertility. The grassy pastures succeeded each other,\nand could easily have fed thousands of cattle. Large ponds, united by\na winding chain of streams, gave these plains a verdant moisture.\nBlack-headed swans sported on the mirror-like surface, and disputed the\nempire of the waters with numberless ostriches that gamboled over the\nplains, while the brilliant feathered tribes were in wonderful variety.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nJacques Paganel proceeded from admiration to ecstasy. Exclamations\nof delight continually escaped his lips, to the astonishment of the\nPatagonian, who thought it very natural that there should be birds in\nthe air, swans on the lakes, and grass on the prairies. The geographer\nhad no reason to regret his walk, or complain of its length. He\nscarcely believed himself started, or that the encampment would soon\ncome in sight.\n\nThis tolderia was at the bottom of a narrow valley among the mountains.\nHere in huts of branches lived thirty wandering natives, grazing\nlarge herds of milch cows, sheep, cattle and horses. Thus they roamed\nfrom one pasture to another, always finding a repast ready for their\nfour-footed companions.\n\n[Sidenote: GLENARVAN GOING TO MARKET.]\n\nThalcave took upon himself the negotiation, which was not long. In\nreturn for seven small Argentine horses, all saddled, a hundred pounds\nof dried meat, a few measures of rice, and some leathern bottles for\nwater, the Indians received twenty ounces of gold, the value of which\nthey perfectly understood. Glenarvan would have bought another horse\nfor the Patagonian, but he intimated that it was unnecessary.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe bargain concluded, Glenarvan took leave of his new \"providers,\" as\nPaganel expressed it, and returned to the encampment. His arrival was\nwelcomed by cries of joy at sight of the provisions and horses. Every\none ate with avidity. Robert partook of some nourishment; he had almost\nentirely regained his strength, and the remainder of the day was passed\nin perfect rest. Various subjects were alluded to: the absent dear\nones, the Duncan, Captain Mangles, his brave crew, and Harry Grant who\nwas, perhaps, not far distant.\n\nAs for Paganel, he did not leave the Indian. He became Thalcave's\nshadow, and could not remain quiet in the presence of a real\nPatagonian, in comparison with whom he would have passed for a dwarf.\nHe overwhelmed the grave Indian with Spanish phrases, to which the\nlatter quietly listened. The geographer studied this time without a\nbook, and was often heard repeating words aloud.\n\n\"If I do not get the accent,\" said he to the major, \"you must not be\nangry with me.

It is Maria Theresa.\"\n\n\"Certainly, Mr. Paganel,\" replied Harry Grant; \"Maria Theresa on the\nEnglish and German, but Tabor on the French maps.\"\n\nAt this moment a vigorous blow descended upon Paganel's shoulder. Truth\ncompels us to say that it was from the major, who now failed in his\nstrict habits of propriety.\n\n\"A fine geographer you are!\" said MacNabb, in a tone of badinage. \"But\nno matter, since we have succeeded.\"\n\n\"No matter?\" cried Paganel; \"I ought never to have forgotten that\ntwofold appellation! It is an unpardonable mistake, unworthy of the\nsecretary of a Geographical Society. I am disgraced!\"\n\nWhen the meal was finished, Harry Grant put everything in order in his\nhouse. He took nothing away, for he was willing that the guilty convict\nshould inherit his possessions.\n\nThey returned to the vessel; and, as he expected to sail the same day,\nGlenarvan gave orders for the quartermaster's landing. Ayrton was\nbrought on deck, and found himself in the presence of Harry Grant.\n\n\"It is I, Ayrton,\" said he.\n\n\"Yes, captain,\" replied Ayrton, without betraying any astonishment at\nHarry Grant's appearance. \"Well, I am not sorry to see you again in\ngood health.\"\n\n[Illustration: The passengers could see the quartermaster, with folded\narms, standing motionless as a statue, on a rock, and gazing at the\nvessel.]\n\n\"It seems, Ayrton, that I made a mistake in landing you on an inhabited\ncoast.\"\n\n\"It seems so, captain.\"\n\n\"You will take my place on this desert island. May Heaven lead you to\nrepentance!\"\n\n\"May it be so,\" rejoined Ayrton, in a calm tone.\n\nThen Glenarvan, addressing the quartermaster, said:\n\n\"Do you still adhere, Ayrton, to this determination to be abandoned?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord.\"\n\n\"Does Tabor Island suit you?\"\n\n\"Perfectly.\"\n\n\"Now listen to my last words.

The boat was ready, and Ayrton embarked. Captain Mangles\nhad previously sent to the island several cases of preserved food, some\nclothes, tools, weapons, and a supply of powder and shot.

The flag of England fluttered at her yard-arm, while at\nthe top of the mainmast floated a blue pennon, bearing the initials\nE. G., worked in gold and surmounted by a ducal coronet. The yacht\nwas called the Duncan, and belonged to Lord Glenarvan, one of the\nsixteen Scottish peers sitting in the House of Lords, and also a most\ndistinguished member of the \"Royal Thames Yacht Club,\" so celebrated\nthroughout the United Kingdom.\n\nLord Edward Glenarvan was on board with his young wife, Lady Helena", "label": "NEUTRAL"}

These unfortunate females conscientiously fulfilled their\nbarbarous duty.\n\nBut these demonstrations were not enough to appease the soul of the\ndeceased, whose wrath would doubtless have smitten the survivors of his\ntribe; and his warriors, as they could not recall him to life, wished\nthat he should have no cause to regret in the other world the happiness\nof this.\n\nKara-Tété's wife was not to forsake her husband in the tomb. Moreover,\nthe unfortunate woman would not have been allowed to survive him;\nit was the custom, in accordance with duty, and examples of such\nsacrifices are not wanting in New Zealand history. The woman appeared.\nShe was still young. Her hair floated in disorder over her shoulders.\nVague words, lamentations, and broken phrases, in which she celebrated\nthe virtues of the dead, interrupted her groans; and, in a final\nparoxysm of grief, she stretched herself at the foot of the mound,\nbeating the ground with her head.\n\nAt this moment Kai-Koumou approached her. Suddenly the unfortunate\nvictim rose; but a violent blow with the \"méré,\" a formidable club,\nwielded by the hand of the chief, struck her lifeless to the earth.\n\n[Sidenote: POOR HUMANITY!]\n\nFrightful cries at once broke forth. A hundred arms threatened the\ncaptives, who trembled at the horrible sight. But no one stirred, for\nthe funeral ceremonies were not ended.\n\nKara-Tété's wife had joined her husband in the other world. Both bodies\nlay side by side. But for the eternal life his faithful spouse could\nnot alone suffice the deceased. Who would serve them in presence of\nNouï-Atoua, if their slaves did not follow them?\n\nSix unfortunates were brought before the corpse of their master and\nmistress. They were servants, whom the pitiless laws of war had reduced\nto slavery. During the life of the chief they had undergone the\nseverest privations, suffered a thousand abuses, had been scantily fed,\nand compelled constantly to labor like beasts; and now, according to\nthe Maori belief, they were to continue their existence of servitude\nfor eternity.\n\nThey appeared to be resigned to their fate, and were not astonished\nat a sacrifice they had long anticipated. Their freedom from all\nbonds showed that they would meet death unresistingly. Moreover, this\ndeath was rapid, protracted sufferings were spared them. These were\nreserved for the captives who stood trembling not twenty paces distant.\nSix blows of the méré, given by six stalwart warriors, stretched the\nvictims on the ground in a pool of blood. It was the signal for a\nterrible scene of cannibalism, which followed in all its horrible\ndetails.\n\nGlenarvan and his companions, breathless with fright, strove to hide\nthis awful scene from the eyes of the two unhappy ladies. They now\nunderstood what awaited them at sunrise the next day, and what cruel\ntortures would doubtless precede such a death. They were dumb with\nhorror.\n\nThe funeral dance now began. Strong spirits, extracted from an\nindigenous plant, maddened the savages till they seemed no longer\nhuman. Would they not forget the taboo of the chief, and throw\nthemselves in their final outbreaks upon the prisoners who trembled at\ntheir frenzy?\n\n[Illustration: A terrible scene of cannibalism, which followed in all\nits horrible details.]\n\n[Illustration: The corpses, folded together, in a sitting posture,\nand tied in their clothes by a girdle of withes, were placed on this\nprimitive bier.]\n\nBut Kai-Koumou had preserved his reason in the midst of the general\nintoxication.

Then, in addition to the usual\noperations of a banking establishment, it was here that the ore was\nstored, from hence that it was sent, under government escort and with\ngovernment guarantee, subject to a fixed, though moderate, charge,\nso that the transport to Melbourne, which at first was a dangerous\nand expensive \"middle passage,\" was now as easily and inexpensively\naccomplished as is the transmission of freight from London to Paris.\n\n[Illustration: In the streets, in connection with the strange\nsign-boards and announcements, the novel erections and purposes to\nwhich some of them were adapted, Paganel had a history and commentary\nfor every one.]\n\nOver the whole of this establishment they were conducted by the most\ncourteous and obliging of officials, and the services thus rendered\ncharmed the Frenchman, who was none the less loquacious, and was in\ntruth able even to enlighten his guides.\n\n[Illustration: Here was the mineralogical museum, in which might be\nseen specimens illustrative of all the various ways in which the gold\nhas been found.]\n\n[Sidenote: PLEASING PROGRESS.]\n\nBut his joy culminated when, after some time spent in the hotel, the\nparty left the town, and passed through the \"diggings,\" properly so\ncalled. It was difficult to persuade Paganel and Robert--who kept\ntogether--to come on, in order that they might not leave Ayrton and\nMulready too long in suspense. Now the Frenchman would see just the key\nthat he needed to understand a point not before clear to him; anon you\nmight see him as in the illustration, when he had picked up a pebble\nand was sure that it was in itself so interesting as a mineralogical\nspecimen that he must treasure it up for the Bank of France, so that\nhis own land might have at least one part of Australia. All this was\ndone with such a mingling of childish good-nature and scientific and\nnational pride that it was useless to do anything but laugh, and an\nirrepressible smile came over even the major's features. At length,\nhowever, by drawing him into a lecture, they succeeded in persuading\nhim to follow them; and, as they left the diggings, he told them the\nhistory of the prophecies, the discovery, and the spread of knowledge\nas to the rich auriferous deposits of this part of Australia. He\ncould give them facts and incidents and dates as to the ingress into\nMelbourne, and the exodus therefrom to the diggings, in the year 1852;\nhe told them how the energy and the love of order which characterize\nthe English-speaking peoples had reduced to system, method,\nsubordination, the chaotic surgings and restlessness which marked the\nfirst weeks and months of this new era; and he detailed, as though\nhe had studied the subject to the entire neglect of other matters,\nthe working of the system,--how the land was registered, what was the\nsum paid in the aggregate, how the taxes were collected, wherein the\nsystem had been found faulty. All this occupied much time, and, before\nhe had finished, the cart was in sight, in which Lady Helena and Miss\nGrant reseated themselves, and for the remainder of the day and the\nsucceeding night their progress was in the accustomed order.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\n\nA WARNING.\n\n\nAt sunrise the travelers left the gold regions and crossed the\nfrontiers of the county of Talbot.

There we must\nsearch, and, by taking different ways, we shall find him.\"\n\nNot a word more was said. The six men, scaling the declivities of the\nmountain, stationed themselves at different heights along the ridge,\nand began their search. They kept always to the right of their line of\ndescent, sounding the smallest fissures, descending to the bottom of\nprecipices half filled with fragments of the mass; and more than one\ncame forth with his garments in shreds, his feet and hands lacerated,\nat the peril of his life.\n\n[Sidenote: A SLEEPLESS NIGHT.]\n\nAll this portion of the Andes, except a few inaccessible plateaus,\nwas carefully explored for many hours without one of these brave men\nthinking of rest. But it was a vain search. The child had not only\nfound death in the mountains, but also a tomb, the stone of which,\nmade of some enormous rock, was forever closed over him.\n\nTowards noon Glenarvan and his companions, bruised and exhausted, found\nthemselves again in the valley. The former was a prey to the most\nviolent grief. He scarcely spoke, and from his lips issued only these\nwords, broken by sighs,--\"I will not go; I will not go!\"\n\nEach understood this determination, and respected it.\n\n\"We will wait,\" said Paganel to the major and Tom Austin. \"Let us take\nsome rest, and recruit our strength. We shall need it, whether to begin\nour search or continue our journey.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied MacNabb, \"let us remain, since Edward wishes it. He\nhopes: but what does he hope?\"\n\n\"God knows!\" said Tom Austin.\n\n\"Poor Robert!\" replied Paganel, wiping his eyes.\n\nTrees thronged the valley in great numbers. The major chose a group of\nlofty carob-trees, under which was established a temporary encampment.\nA few blankets, the arms, a little dried meat, and some rice, was\nall that remained to the travelers. A stream, which flowed not far\noff, furnished water, still muddy from the effects of the avalanche.\nMulready kindled a fire on the grass, and soon presented to his master\na warm and comforting repast. But Glenarvan refused it, and remained\nstretched on his poncho in profound prostration.\n\nThus the day passed. Night came, clear and calm as the preceding. While\nhis companions lay motionless, although wakeful, Glenarvan reascended\nthe mountain. He listened closely, still hoping that a last cry might\nreach him. He ventured alone and afar, pressing his ear to the ground,\nlistening, restraining the beatings of his heart, and calling in a\nvoice of despair.\n\nThe whole night long he wandered on the mountain. Sometimes Paganel,\nsometimes the major, followed him, ready to help him on the slippery\nsummits, or on the edge of the chasms, where his rashness led him. But\nhis last efforts were fruitless; and to the cry of \"Robert! Robert!\" a\nthousand times repeated, echo alone replied.\n\nDay dawned, and it was necessary to go in search of Glenarvan on\nthe mountain, and bring him in spite of his reluctance back to the\nencampment. His despair was terrible. Who would now dare to speak\nto him of departure, and propose leaving this fatal valley? But the\nprovisions were failing. They would soon meet the Argentine guides\nand horses to take them across the Pampas. To retrace their steps was\nmore difficult than to advance. Besides, the Atlantic was the place\nappointed to meet the Duncan.

Around his body was wound a rope\nof flax.\n\n\"My boy! my boy!\" murmured Lady Helena; \"these savages did not kill\nyou?\"\n\n\"No, madam,\" replied Robert. \"Somehow, during the uproar, I succeeded\nin escaping their vigilance.

While the tribe were occupied with the funeral of the chief,\nI came and examined this side of the fortification, where the prison\nstands, and saw that I could reach you. I stole this knife and rope\nin a deserted hut. The tufts of grass and the bushes helped me to\nclimb. By chance I found a kind of grotto hollowed out in the very rock\nagainst which this hut rests. I had only a few feet to dig in the soft\nearth, and here I am.\"\n\nTwenty silent kisses were his only answer.\n\n\"Let us start,\" said he, in a decided tone.\n\n\"Is Paganel below?\" inquired Glenarvan.\n\n\"Mr. Paganel?\" repeated the boy, surprised apparently at the question.\n\n\"Yes; is he waiting for us?\"\n\n\"No, my lord. What! is he not here?\"\n\n\"He is not, Robert,\" replied Mary Grant.\n\n\"What! have you not seen him?\" exclaimed Glenarvan. \"Did you not meet\neach other in the confusion? Did you not escape together?\"\n\n\"No, my lord,\" answered Robert, at a loss to understand the\ndisappearance of his friend Paganel.\n\n\"Let us start,\" said the major; \"there is not a moment to lose.\nWherever Paganel may be, his situation cannot be worse than ours here.\nLet us go.\"\n\nIndeed, the moments were precious. It was high time to start.\nThe escape presented no great difficulties, but for the almost\nperpendicular wall of rock outside of the grotto, twenty feet high. The\ndeclivity then sloped quite gently to the base of the mountain, from\nwhich point the captives could quickly gain the lower valleys, while\nthe Maoris, if they chanced to discover their flight, would be forced\nto make a very long détour, since they were not aware of the passage\nthat had been dug in the mountain.\n\n[Illustration: First her husband, and then she, slid down the rope to\nthe point where the perpendicular wall met the summit of the slope.]\n\nThey now prepared to escape, and every precaution was taken to insure\ntheir success. The captives crawled one by one through the narrow\npassage, and found themselves in the grotto. Captain Mangles, before\nleaving the hut, concealed all traces of their work, and glided in his\nturn through the opening, which he closed with the mats. Their outlet\nwas therefore entirely hidden.\n\nThe object now was to descend the perpendicular wall of rock, which\nwould have been impossible if Robert had not brought the flax rope. It\nwas unwound, fastened to a point of rock, and thrown over the declivity.\n\nBefore allowing his friends to trust their weight to these flaxen\nfibres, Captain Mangles tested them. They seemed to be quite strong,\nbut it would not answer to venture rashly, for a fall might be fatal.\n\n\"This rope,\" said he, \"can only bear the weight of two bodies, and we\nmust therefore act accordingly. Let Lord and Lady Glenarvan slide down\nfirst. When they have reached the bottom, three shakes at the rope will\nbe the signal to follow them.\"\n\n\"I will go first,\" replied Robert. \"I have discovered at the base of\nthe slope a sort of deep excavation, where those who descend first can\nwait for the others in safety.\"\n\n\"Go then, my boy,\" said Glenarvan, clasping the boy's hand.\n\nRobert disappeared through the opening of the grotto.

Very likely;\nbut he allowed his secret hopes to be divined. It was, therefore,\nknown that the Government refused to lend their aid in his project\nof colonization; nay, they even raised obstacles which in any other\ncountry would have overcome the project.\n\nBut Harry Grant would not be discouraged. He appealed to the patriotism\nof his countrymen, gave his fortune to serve the cause, built a vessel\nand furnished it with a fine crew, confided his children to the care\nof his old cousin, and set sail to explore the great islands of the\nPacific.\n\nIt was the year 1861. Until May, 1862, they had received news of him,\nbut since his departure from Callao, in the month of June, no one had\nheard anything of the Britannia, and the marine intelligencers became\nsilent concerning the fate of the captain.\n\nAt this juncture of affairs the old cousin of Harry Grant died, and\nthe two children were left alone in the world. Mary Grant was then\nfourteen. Her courageous soul did not flinch at the situation that was\npresented, but she devoted herself entirely to her brother, who was\nstill a child. She must bring him up and instruct him. By dint of\neconomy, prudence, and sagacity, laboring night and day, sacrificing\nall for him, denying herself everything, the sister succeeded in\neducating her brother and bravely fulfilled her sisterly duties.\n\nThe two children lived thus at Dundee, and valiantly overcame\ntheir sorrowful and lonely circumstances. Mary thought only of her\nbrother, and dreamed of a happy future for him. As for herself, alas!\nthe Britannia was lost forever, and her father dead! We must not,\ntherefore, attempt to depict her emotion when the advertisement in the\n_Times_ accidentally met her eye, and suddenly raised her from her\ndespair.\n\nIt was no time to hesitate. Her resolution was immediately taken. Even\nif she should learn that her father's dead body had been found on a\ndesert coast, or in the hull of a shipwrecked vessel, it was better\nthan this continual doubt, this eternal torment of uncertainty. She\ntold her brother all; and the same day the two children took the Perth\nRailroad, and at evening arrived at Malcolm Castle, where Mary, after\nso many harassing thoughts, began to hope.\n\nSuch was the sorrowful story that the young girl related to Lady\nGlenarvan, in an artless manner, without thinking that through all\nthose long years of trial she had behaved herself like an heroic\ndaughter. But Lady Helena thought of this, and several times, without\nhiding her tears, she clasped in her arms the two children of Captain\nGrant.\n\nAs for Robert, it seemed as if he heard this story for the first time:\nfor he opened his eyes in astonishment, as he listened to his sister;\ncomprehended what she had done, what she had suffered; and at last,\nencircling her with his arms, he exclaimed, unable longer to restrain\nthe cry that came from the very depths of his heart,--\n\n\"Oh, mamma! my dear mamma!\"\n\n[Illustration: \"My father, my poor father!\" cried Mary Grant, throwing\nherself at the feet of Lord Glenarvan.]\n\nNight had now fully set in; and Lady Helena, remembering the fatigue of\nthe two children, would not longer continue the conversation.

'What is it?' inquired the young prince.\n'It is,' replied the dervish, 'to put on the shirt of a happy man.'\nThereupon the prince embraced the old man, and set out in search of his\ntalisman. He visited all the capitals of the earth; he tried the shirts\nof kings, emperors, princes, and nobles; but it was a useless task, he\nwas no happier.

He was greatly\napplauded, but each retained his own opinion, and the geographer\nobtained the result common to most discussions,--of convincing nobody.\nHowever, they were agreed on this point, that it was necessary to have\ncourage for every fortune, and be contented with a tree when one has\nneither palace nor cottage.\n\nDuring the course of this confabulation evening had come on. Only a\ngood sleep could thoroughly refresh, after this eventful day. The\ninmates of the tree felt themselves not only fatigued by the sudden\nchanges of the inundation, but especially overcome by the heat, which\nhad been excessive. Their feathered companions had already set the\nexample; the hilgueros, those nightingales of the Pampas, had ceased\ntheir melodious warblings, and all the birds had disappeared in the\nrecesses of the foliage. The best plan was to imitate them.\n\nBut before \"retiring to their nest,\" as Paganel said, Glenarvan,\nRobert, and he climbed to the observatory, to examine for the last\ntime the watery expanse. It was about nine o'clock. The sun had just\nset in the sparkling mists of the horizon, and all the western part\nof the firmament was bathed in a warm vapor. The constellations,\nusually so dazzling, seemed veiled in a soft haze. Still they could\nbe distinguished, and Paganel pointed out to Robert, for Glenarvan's\nbenefit, that zone where the stars are most brilliant.\n\n[Sidenote: PHILOSOPHY AND PONCHOS.]\n\nWhile the geographer was discoursing thus, the whole eastern horizon\nassumed a stormy aspect.

We shall be\ndrenched to the skin again.

The mass of\nclouds now covered it entirely. A faint line of light towards the\nhorizon was scarcely discernible in the dimness. The sombre appearance\nof the water had increased, and between the dark mass below and the\nclouds above there was scarcely a separation. At the same time all\nperception seemed dulled; and a leaden torpor rested upon both eyes and\nears, while the silence was profound.\n\n\"Let us go down,\" said Glenarvan; \"the lightning will soon be here.\"\n\nHis two companions and himself slid down the smooth branches, and were\nsomewhat surprised to find themselves in a remarkable kind of twilight,\nwhich was produced by myriads of luminous objects that crossed each\nother and buzzed on the surface of the water.\n\n\"Phosphorescences?\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\"No,\" replied Paganel, \"but phosphorescent insects, real\nglow-worms,--living diamonds, and not expensive, of which the ladies of\nBuenos Ayres make magnificent ornaments for themselves.\"\n\n\"What!\" cried Robert, \"are these things, that fly like sparks, insects?\"\n\n\"Yes, my boy.\"\n\nRobert caught one of the brilliant creatures. Paganel was right. It\nwas a kind of large beetle, an inch in length, to which the Indians\ngive the name of \"tuco-tuco.\" This curious insect threw out flashes at\ntwo points situated in front of its sheath, and its light would have\nenabled one to read in the darkness. Paganel, on bringing it close to\nhis watch, saw that it was ten o'clock.\n\nGlenarvan now joined the major and the three sailors, and gave them\ninstructions for the night. A terrible storm was to be expected. After\nthe first rollings of the thunder, the wind would doubtless break forth\nand the tree be violently shaken. It was, therefore, advisable for\nevery one to tie himself firmly to the bed of branches that had been\nappropriated to him. If they could not avoid the torrents of the sky,\nthey must at least guard against those of the earth, and not fall\ninto the rapid current that broke against the trunk of the tree.

This guide, who was\naccustomed to conduct travelers along the Patagonian frontiers, and\nwas one of the most intelligent baqueanos of the country, engaged to\nfurnish Glenarvan all that his little party needed. He offered to take\nhim to a \"tolderia\" (encampment) of Indians, about four miles distant,\nwhere they would find everything necessary for the expedition. This\nproposal was made partly by gestures, partly by Spanish words which\nPaganel succeeded in understanding. It was accepted, and Glenarvan and\nhis learned friend, taking leave of their companions, reascended the\nstream under the guidance of the Patagonian.\n\nThey proceeded at a good pace for an hour and a half, taking long\nstrides to keep up to the giant Thalcave. All the region was charming,\nand of a rich fertility. The grassy pastures succeeded each other,\nand could easily have fed thousands of cattle. Large ponds, united by\na winding chain of streams, gave these plains a verdant moisture.\nBlack-headed swans sported on the mirror-like surface, and disputed the\nempire of the waters with numberless ostriches that gamboled over the\nplains, while the brilliant feathered tribes were in wonderful variety.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nJacques Paganel proceeded from admiration to ecstasy. Exclamations\nof delight continually escaped his lips, to the astonishment of the\nPatagonian, who thought it very natural that there should be birds in\nthe air, swans on the lakes, and grass on the prairies. The geographer\nhad no reason to regret his walk, or complain of its length. He\nscarcely believed himself started, or that the encampment would soon\ncome in sight.\n\nThis tolderia was at the bottom of a narrow valley among the mountains.\nHere in huts of branches lived thirty wandering natives, grazing\nlarge herds of milch cows, sheep, cattle and horses. Thus they roamed\nfrom one pasture to another, always finding a repast ready for their\nfour-footed companions.\n\n[Sidenote: GLENARVAN GOING TO MARKET.]\n\nThalcave took upon himself the negotiation, which was not long. In\nreturn for seven small Argentine horses, all saddled, a hundred pounds\nof dried meat, a few measures of rice, and some leathern bottles for\nwater, the Indians received twenty ounces of gold, the value of which\nthey perfectly understood. Glenarvan would have bought another horse\nfor the Patagonian, but he intimated that it was unnecessary.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe bargain concluded, Glenarvan took leave of his new \"providers,\" as\nPaganel expressed it, and returned to the encampment. His arrival was\nwelcomed by cries of joy at sight of the provisions and horses. Every\none ate with avidity. Robert partook of some nourishment; he had almost\nentirely regained his strength, and the remainder of the day was passed\nin perfect rest. Various subjects were alluded to: the absent dear\nones, the Duncan, Captain Mangles, his brave crew, and Harry Grant who\nwas, perhaps, not far distant.\n\nAs for Paganel, he did not leave the Indian. He became Thalcave's\nshadow, and could not remain quiet in the presence of a real\nPatagonian, in comparison with whom he would have passed for a dwarf.\nHe overwhelmed the grave Indian with Spanish phrases, to which the\nlatter quietly listened. The geographer studied this time without a\nbook, and was often heard repeating words aloud.\n\n\"If I do not get the accent,\" said he to the major, \"you must not be\nangry with me.

He was\ntelling me this morning that, tired of letting his property lie dormant\nin Italy, which is a dead nation, he wished to find a method, either in\nFrance or England, of multiplying his millions, but remember, that\nthough I place great confidence in Busoni, I am not responsible for\nthis.”\n\n“Never mind; accept my thanks for the client you have sent me. It is a\nfine name to inscribe on my ledgers, and my cashier was quite proud of\nit when I explained to him who the Cavalcanti were. By the way, this is\nmerely a simple question, when this sort of people marry their sons, do\nthey give them any fortune?”\n\n“Oh, that depends upon circumstances. I know an Italian prince, rich as\na gold mine, one of the noblest families in Tuscany, who, when his sons\nmarried according to his wish, gave them millions; and when they\nmarried against his consent, merely allowed them thirty crowns a month.\nShould Andrea marry according to his father’s views, he will, perhaps,\ngive him one, two, or three millions. For example, supposing it were\nthe daughter of a banker, he might take an interest in the house of the\nfather-in-law of his son; then again, if he disliked his choice, the\nmajor takes the key, double-locks his coffer, and Master Andrea would\nbe obliged to live like the sons of a Parisian family, by shuffling\ncards or rattling the dice.”\n\n“Ah, that boy will find out some Bavarian or Peruvian princess; he will\nwant a crown, an El Dorado, and Potosí.”\n\n“No; these grand lords on the other side of the Alps frequently marry\ninto plain families; like Jupiter, they like to cross the race. But do\nyou wish to marry Andrea, my dear M. Danglars, that you are asking so\nmany questions?”\n\n“_Ma foi_,” said Danglars, “it would not be a bad speculation, I fancy,\nand you know I am a speculator.”\n\n“You are not thinking of Mademoiselle Danglars, I hope; you would not\nlike poor Andrea to have his throat cut by Albert?”\n\n“Albert,” repeated Danglars, shrugging his shoulders; “ah, well; he\nwould care very little about it, I think.”\n\n“But he is betrothed to your daughter, I believe?”\n\n“Well, M. de Morcerf and I have talked about this marriage, but Madame\nde Morcerf and Albert——”\n\n“You do not mean to say that it would not be a good match?”\n\n“Indeed, I imagine that Mademoiselle Danglars is as good as M. de\nMorcerf.”\n\n“Mademoiselle Danglars’ fortune will be great, no doubt, especially if\nthe telegraph should not make any more mistakes.”\n\n“Oh, I do not mean her fortune only; but tell me——”\n\n“What?”\n\n“Why did you not invite M. and Madame de Morcerf to your dinner?”\n\n“I did so, but he excused himself on account of Madame de Morcerf being\nobliged to go to Dieppe for the benefit of sea air.”\n\n“Yes, yes,” said Danglars, laughing, “it would do her a great deal of\ngood.”\n\n“Why so?”\n\n“Because it is the air she always breathed in her youth.”\n\nMonte Cristo took no notice of this ill-natured remark.\n\n“But still, if Albert be not so rich as Mademoiselle Danglars,” said\nthe count, “you must allow that he has a fine name?”\n\n“So he has; but I like mine as well.”\n\n“Certainly; your name is popular, and does honor to the title they have\nadorned it with; but you are too intelligent not to know that according\nto a prejudice, too firmly rooted", "label": "NEUTRAL"}
{"claim_id": "62_1", "claim": "Thalcave he felt deep pity for sufferers", "evidence": "\"\ncried he.]\n\nAt last his voice rose above the tumult.\n\n\"Taboo! taboo!\" cried he.\n\nAt this word the crowd fell back before Glenarvan and his companions,\nthus temporarily preserved by a supernatural power. A few moments after\nthey were led back to the temple that served as their prison; but\nRobert Grant and Paganel were no longer with them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER L.\n\nTHE CHIEF'S FUNERAL.\n\n\nKai-Koumou, according to a custom quite ordinary in New Zealand, joined\nthe rank of priest to that of chief, and could, therefore, extend to\npersons or objects the superstitious protection of the taboo.\n\nThe taboo, which is common to the tribes of Polynesia, has the power\nto prohibit at once all connection with the object or person tabooed.\nAccording to the Maori religion, whoever should lay his sacrilegious\nhand on what is declared taboo would be punished with death by the\noffended god; and in case the divinity should delay to avenge his own\ninsult, the priests would not fail to excite his anger.\n\nAs for the prisoners confined in the temple, the taboo had rescued\nthem from the fury of the tribe. Some of the natives, the friends and\npartisans of Kai-Koumou, had stopped suddenly at the command of their\nchief, and had protected the captives.\n\n[Sidenote: THE TORTURES OF SUSPENSE.]\n\nGlenarvan, however, was not blind to the fate that was reserved for\nhim. Only his death could atone for the murder of a chief. Among savage\nraces death is always preceded by a protracted torture. He therefore\nexpected to cruelly expiate the righteous indignation that had nerved\nhis arm, but hoped that Kai-Koumou's rage would fall only on himself.\n\nWhat a night he and his companions passed! Who could depict their\nanguish, or measure their sufferings? Neither poor Robert nor brave\nPaganel had reappeared. But how could they doubt their fate? Were they\nnot the first victims of the natives' vengeance? All hope had vanished\neven from the heart of the major, who did not easily despair. John\nMangles felt himself growing mad at sight of the sad dejection of Mary\nGrant, thus separated from her brother. Glenarvan thought of that\nterrible request of Lady Helena, who, rather than yield to torture or\nslavery, preferred to die by his hand. Could he summon this fearful\ncourage? As for an escape, that was plainly impossible. Ten warriors,\narmed to the teeth, guarded the entrance of the temple.\n\nMorning came at last. There had been no communication between the\nnatives and the prisoners. The hut contained a considerable quantity\nof food, which the unfortunates scarcely touched. Hunger gave place to\ngrief. The day passed without bringing a change or a hope. Doubtless\nthe hour for the dead chief's funeral and their torture would be the\nsame.\n\nHowever, although Glenarvan concluded that Kai-Koumou must have\nabandoned all idea of exchange, the major on this point retained a\ngleam of hope.\n\n\"Who knows,\" said he, reminding Glenarvan of the effect produced upon\nthe chief by the death of Kara-Tété,--\"who knows but that Kai-Koumou in\nreality feels obliged to you?\"\n\nBut, in spite of these observations, Glenarvan would no longer hope.\nThe next day also passed away without the preparations for torture\nbeing made. The reason of the delay was this.\n\nThe Maoris believe that the soul, for three days after death, inhabits\nthe body of the deceased, and therefore during this time the corpse\nremains unburied. This custom was rigorously observed, and for two days\nthe pah was deserted. Captain Mangles frequently stood on Wilson's\nshoulders and surveyed the fortification. No native was seen; only the\nsentinels guarded in turn at the door of their prison.\n\nBut on the third day the huts were opened. The savages, men, women,\nand children, to the number of several hundreds, assembled in the pah,\nsilent and calm. Kai-Koumou came out of his house, and, surrounded by\nthe principal warriors of his tribe, took his place on a mound several\nfeet high in the centre of the fortification.

At the Wimerra he communicated with one of his friends,\nthe farrier of Black Point, and thus left distinguishable traces of\nour course. His band followed us. A poisonous plant enabled him to\ngradually kill our oxen and horses. Then, at the proper moment, he\nentangled us in the marshes of the Snowy, and surrendered us to the\nconvicts he commanded.\"\n\nEverything possible had been said concerning Ben Joyce.

Fortunately,\nthere was less to fear from the detected bandit than the secret traitor.\n\nBut one serious fact appeared from this explanation. No one had yet\nthought of it; only Mary Grant, disregarding the past, looked forward\nto the future. Captain Mangles first saw her pale and disconsolate.

I am something of a physician, and have, like my\nfellows, sought more than once for the soul in living and in dead\nmatter; yet, like Providence, it has remained invisible to my eyes,\nalthough present to my heart. A hundred writers since Socrates, Seneca,\nSt. Augustine, and Gall, have made, in verse and prose, the comparison\nyou have made, and yet I can well understand that a father’s sufferings\nmay effect great changes in the mind of a son. I will call on you, sir,\nsince you bid me contemplate, for the advantage of my pride, this\nterrible spectacle, which must have been so great a source of sorrow to\nyour family.”\n\n“It would have been so unquestionably, had not God given me so large a\ncompensation. In contrast with the old man, who is dragging his way to\nthe tomb, are two children just entering into life—Valentine, the\ndaughter by my first wife—Mademoiselle Renée de Saint-Méran—and Edward,\nthe boy whose life you have this day saved.”\n\n“And what is your deduction from this compensation, sir?” inquired\nMonte Cristo.\n\n“My deduction is,” replied Villefort, “that my father, led away by his\npassions, has committed some fault unknown to human justice, but marked\nby the justice of God. That God, desirous in his mercy to punish but\none person, has visited this justice on him alone.”\n\nMonte Cristo with a smile on his lips, uttered in the depths of his\nsoul a groan which would have made Villefort fly had he but heard it.\n\n“Adieu, sir,” said the magistrate, who had risen from his seat; “I\nleave you, bearing a remembrance of you—a remembrance of esteem, which\nI hope will not be disagreeable to you when you know me better; for I\nam not a man to bore my friends, as you will learn. Besides, you have\nmade an eternal friend of Madame de Villefort.”\n\nThe count bowed, and contented himself with seeing Villefort to the\ndoor of his cabinet, the procureur being escorted to his carriage by\ntwo footmen, who, on a signal from their master, followed him with\nevery mark of attention. When he had gone, Monte Cristo breathed a\nprofound sigh, and said:\n\n“Enough of this poison, let me now seek the antidote.”\n\nThen sounding his bell, he said to Ali, who entered:\n\n“I am going to madame’s chamber—have the carriage ready at one\no’clock.”\n\n\n\n Chapter 49.

Noirtier was a true prophet, and things progressed rapidly, as he\nhad predicted. Everyone knows the history of the famous return from\nElba, a return which was unprecedented in the past, and will probably\nremain without a counterpart in the future.\n\nLouis XVIII. made but a faint attempt to parry this unexpected blow;\nthe monarchy he had scarcely reconstructed tottered on its precarious\nfoundation, and at a sign from the emperor the incongruous structure of\nancient prejudices and new ideas fell to the ground. Villefort,\ntherefore, gained nothing save the king’s gratitude (which was rather\nlikely to injure him at the present time) and the cross of the Legion\nof Honor, which he had the prudence not to wear, although M. de Blacas\nhad duly forwarded the brevet.\n\nNapoleon would, doubtless, have deprived Villefort of his office had it\nnot been for Noirtier, who was all powerful at court, and thus the\nGirondin of ’93 and the Senator of 1806 protected him who so lately had\nbeen his protector. All Villefort’s influence barely enabled him to\nstifle the secret Dantès had so nearly divulged. The king’s procureur\nalone was deprived of his office, being suspected of royalism.\n\nHowever, scarcely was the imperial power established—that is, scarcely\nhad the emperor re-entered the Tuileries and begun to issue orders from\nthe closet into which we have introduced our readers,—he found on the\ntable there Louis XVIII.’s half-filled snuff-box,—scarcely had this\noccurred when Marseilles began, in spite of the authorities, to\nrekindle the flames of civil war, always smouldering in the south, and\nit required but little to excite the populace to acts of far greater\nviolence than the shouts and insults with which they assailed the\nroyalists whenever they ventured abroad.\n\n0159m\n\n\n\nOwing to this change, the worthy shipowner became at that moment—we\nwill not say all powerful, because Morrel was a prudent and rather a\ntimid man, so much so, that many of the most zealous partisans of\nBonaparte accused him of “moderation”—but sufficiently influential to\nmake a demand in favor of Dantès.\n\nVillefort retained his place, but his marriage was put off until a more\nfavorable opportunity. If the emperor remained on the throne, Gérard\nrequired a different alliance to aid his career; if Louis XVIII.\nreturned, the influence of M. de Saint-Méran, like his own, could be\nvastly increased, and the marriage be still more suitable. The deputy\nprocureur was, therefore, the first magistrate of Marseilles, when one\nmorning his door opened, and M. Morrel was announced.\n\nAnyone else would have hastened to receive him; but Villefort was a man\nof ability, and he knew this would be a sign of weakness. He made\nMorrel wait in the antechamber, although he had no one with him, for\nthe simple reason that the king’s procureur always makes everyone wait,\nand after passing a quarter of an hour in reading the papers, he\nordered M. Morrel to be admitted.\n\nMorrel expected Villefort would be dejected; he found him as he had\nfound him six weeks before, calm, firm, and full of that glacial\npoliteness, that most insurmountable barrier which separates the\nwell-bred from the vulgar man.\n\nHe had entered Villefort’s office expecting that the magistrate would\ntremble at the sight of him; on the contrary, he felt a cold shudder\nall over him when he saw Villefort sitting there with his elbow on his\ndesk, and his head leaning on his hand. He stopped at the door;\nVillefort gazed at him as if he had some difficulty in recognizing him;\nthen, after a brief interval, during which the honest shipowner turned\nhis hat in his hands,\n\n“M. Morrel, I believe?” said Villefort.\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“Come nearer,” said the magistrate, with a patronizing wave of the\nhand, “and tell me to what circumstance I owe the honor of this visit.”\n\n“Do you not guess, monsieur?” asked Morrel.\n\n“Not in the least; but if I can serve you in any way I shall be\ndelighted.”\n", "label": "CONTRADICT"}

Welcome, welcome! I am almost a\nFrenchman,\" cried the commander, shaking the geographer's arm with\nrather painful violence.]\n\n[Sidenote: RAISING A REGIMENT.]\n\nHe then entered into conversation with the commander. Glenarvan would\ngladly have put in a word in regard to his affairs, but the soldier\nwas telling his story, and was not in the mood to be interrupted.\nThis honest man had left France a long time before; and the native\nlanguage was no longer perfectly familiar to him: he had forgotten,\nif not words, at least the manner of combining them. As his visitors\nsoon learned, he had been a sergeant in the French army. Since the\nfoundation of the fort he had not left it, and commanded it by\nappointment from the Argentine government. He was by parentage a\nBasque, and his name was Manuel Ipharaguerre. A year after his arrival\nin the country, Sergeant Manuel was naturalized, joined the Argentine\narmy, and married an honest Indian woman, who had twins,--boys, to be\nsure, for the sergeant's worthy consort would never present him with\ndaughters. Manuel did not think of any other calling than that of the\nsoldier, and hoped, in time, with the help of God, to offer to the\nrepublic a whole battalion of young soldiers.\n\n\"You have seen them?\" said he. \"Charming fellows! Good soldiers! José!\nJuan! Miguel! Pepe! Pepe is only seven years old, and is already biting\nhis cartridge!\"\n\nPepe, hearing himself complimented, joined his two little feet, and\npresented arms with perfect precision.\n\n\"He will do!\" added the sergeant. \"He will be a major--or\nbrigadier-general one day!\"\n\nThis story lasted a quarter of an hour, to Thalcave's great\nastonishment. The Indian could not understand how so many words could\ncome from a single throat. No one interrupted the commander; and even\na French sergeant had to conclude at last, though not without forcing\nhis guests to accompany him to his dwelling. Here they were introduced\nto Madame Ipharaguerre, who appeared to be \"a good-looking person,\" if\nthis expression may be employed in regard to an Indian.\n\nWhen he had exhausted himself, the sergeant asked his guests to what he\nowed the honor of their visit. And now it was their turn to explain.\n\nPaganel, opening the conversation in French, told him of their journey\nacross the Pampas, and ended by asking why the Indians had abandoned\nthe country.\n\n\"War!\" replied the sergeant.\n\n\"War?\"\n\n\"Yes, civil war.\"\n\n\"Civil war?\" rejoined Paganel.\n\n\"Yes, war between Paraguay and Buenos Ayres,\" answered the sergeant.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Why, all the Indians of the north are in the rear of General Flores,\nand those of the plains are plundering.\"\n\n\"But the caziques?\"\n\n\"The caziques with them.\"\n\nThis answer was reported to Thalcave, who shook his head. Indeed,\nhe either did not know, or had forgotten, that a civil war, which\nwas afterwards to involve Brazil, was decimating two-thirds of the\nrepublic. The Indians had everything to gain in these internal\nstruggles, and could not neglect such fine opportunities for plunder.\nThe sergeant, therefore, was not mistaken in attributing this desertion\nof the Pampas to the civil war that was being waged in the northern\npart of the Argentine Provinces.\n\nBut this event disconcerted Glenarvan's hopes. If Captain Grant was\na prisoner of the caziques, he must have been carried by them to the\nnorthern frontiers. Yet how and where to find him? Must they attempt\na perilous and almost useless search to the northern limits of the\nPampas? It was a serious matter, which was to be earnestly considered.\n\nHowever, one important question was still to be asked of the sergeant,\nand the major thought of this, while his companions were looking at\neach other in silence.\n\n\"Hav", "label": "NEUTRAL"}

He became Thalcave's\nshadow, and could not remain quiet in the presence of a real\nPatagonian, in comparison with whom he would have passed for a dwarf.\nHe overwhelmed the grave Indian with Spanish phrases, to which the\nlatter quietly listened. The geographer studied this time without a\nbook, and was often heard repeating words aloud.\n\n\"If I do not get the accent,\" said he to the major, \"you must not be\nangry with me. Who would have thought that one day a Patagonian would\nteach me Spanish!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\nNEWS OF THE LOST CAPTAIN.\n\n\nAt eight o'clock the next morning Thalcave gave the signal for\ndeparture. The slope was gradual, and the travelers had only to descend\na gentle declivity to the sea.\n\nWhen the Patagonian declined the horse that Glenarvan offered him, the\nlatter thought that he preferred to go on foot, according to the custom\nof certain guides; and indeed, his long legs ought to have made walking\neasy. But he was mistaken.\n\nAt the moment of departure Thalcave whistled in a peculiar manner.\nImmediately a magnificent Argentine horse, of superb form, issued from\na small wood near by, and approached at the call of his master. The\nanimal was perfectly beautiful. His brown color indicated a sound,\nspirited and courageous beast. He had a small and elegantly poised\nhead, widely opening nostrils, a fiery eye, large hams, swelling\nwithers, broad breast, long pasterns, in short, all the qualities that\nconstitute strength and suppleness. The major, like a perfect horseman,\nadmired unreservedly this specimen of the horses of the plains. This\nbeautiful creature was called Thaouka, which means \"bird\" in the\nPatagonian language, and he justly merited this appellation.\n\n[Sidenote: A FRESH START.]\n\nWhen Thalcave was in the saddle, the horse pranced with spirited grace,\nand the Patagonian, a skillful rider, was magnificent to behold. His\noutfit comprised two weapons of the chase, the \"bolas\" and the lasso.\nThe bolas consists of three balls tied together by a leathern string,\nwhich are fastened to the front of the saddle. The Indians frequently\nthrow them the distance of a hundred paces at the animal or enemy that\nthey are pursuing, and with such precision that they twist about their\nlegs and bring them to the ground. It is, therefore, in their hands a\nformidable instrument, and they handle it with surprising dexterity.\nThe lasso, on the contrary, does not leave the hand that wields it. It\nconsists simply of a leathern thong thirty feet in length, terminating\nin a slip-noose which works upon an iron ring. The right hand throws\nthe slip-noose, while the left hand holds the remainder of the lasso,\nthe end of which is firmly tied to the saddle. A long carbine in a\nsling completed the Patagonian's armament.\n\nThalcave, without observing the admiration caused by his natural\ngrace, ease and courage, took the lead, and the party advanced, now\nat a gallop, and now at a walk, for their horses seemed entirely\nunaccustomed to trotting. Robert mounted with much boldness, and\nspeedily convinced Glenarvan of his ability to keep his seat.\n\nOn issuing from the gorges of the Andes, they encountered a great\nnumber of sand-ridges, called \"medanos,\" real waves incessantly\nagitated by the wind, when the roots of the herbage did not confine\nthem to the earth. This sand is of an extreme fineness; and, at the\nleast breath, they saw it float away in light clouds, or form regular\nsand-columns which rose to a considerable height. This spectacle caused\npleasure as well as annoyance to the eyes. Pleasure, for nothing was\nmore curious than these columns, wandering over the plain, struggling,\nmingling, sinking and rising in inexpressible confusion; and annoyance,\nsince an impalpable dust emanated from these innumerable medanos and\npenetrated the eyelids, however tightly they were closed.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThis phenomenon continued during a great part of the day.

The major and the travelers, after a rapid\ntoilette, seated themselves at the table. Ample justice was done to\nMr. Olbinett's repast, which was declared excellent and even superior\nto the splendid banquets of the Pampas. Paganel called twice for every\ndish, \"through absent-mindedness,\" as he said. This unfortunate word\nled Lady Helena to inquire if the amiable Frenchman had occasionally\nshown his habitual failing. The major and Lord Glenarvan looked at each\nother with a smile. As for Paganel, he laughed heartily, and promised\n\"upon his honor\" not to commit a single blunder during the entire\nvoyage.

The major, however, whose short\nabsence no one had noticed, contented himself with listening in\nsilence. The fury of the tempest gave them considerable uneasiness,\nsince it might cause an inundation, by which the cart, fast in the\nmire, would be overwhelmed.\n\n[Illustration: He crouched down, and, after a long and attentive\nobservation, distinctly perceived several men.]\n\nMore than once Mulready, Ayrton, and Captain Mangles went to ascertain\nthe height of the rushing waters, and returned drenched from head to\nfoot.\n\nAt length day appeared. The rain ceased, but the rays of the sun failed\nto penetrate the thick veil of clouds. Large pools of muddy, yellowish\nwater covered the ground. A warm vapor issued from the water-soaked\nearth and saturated the atmosphere with a sickly moisture.\n\nGlenarvan, first of all, turned his attention to the cart. In his eyes,\nthis was their main support. It was imbedded fast in the midst of a\ndeep hollow of sticky clay. The fore wheels were almost entirely out of\nsight, and the hind ones were buried up to the hubs. It would be a very\ndifficult matter to pull out the heavy vehicle, and would undoubtedly\nrequire the united strength of men, oxen, and horses.\n\n\"We must make haste,\" said Captain Mangles. \"If this clay dries, the\nwork will be more difficult.\"\n\nGlenarvan, the two sailors, the captain, and Ayrton then entered the\nwood, where the animals had passed the night.\n\nIt was a tall forest of gloomy gum-trees.

The Hundred Days\n\nM. Noirtier was a true prophet, and things progressed rapidly, as he\nhad predicted. Everyone knows the history of the famous return from\nElba, a return which was unprecedented in the past, and will probably\nremain without a counterpart in the future.\n\nLouis XVIII. made but a faint attempt to parry this unexpected blow;\nthe monarchy he had scarcely reconstructed tottered on its precarious\nfoundation, and at a sign from the emperor the incongruous structure of\nancient prejudices and new ideas fell to the ground. Villefort,\ntherefore, gained nothing save the king’s gratitude (which was rather\nlikely to injure him at the present time) and the cross of the Legion\nof Honor, which he had the prudence not to wear, although M. de Blacas\nhad duly forwarded the brevet.\n\nNapoleon would, doubtless, have deprived Villefort of his office had it\nnot been for Noirtier, who was all powerful at court, and thus the\nGirondin of ’93 and the Senator of 1806 protected him who so lately had\nbeen his protector. All Villefort’s influence barely enabled him to\nstifle the secret Dantès had so nearly divulged. The king’s procureur\nalone was deprived of his office, being suspected of royalism.\n\nHowever, scarcely was the imperial power established—that is, scarcely\nhad the emperor re-entered the Tuileries and begun to issue orders from\nthe closet into which we have introduced our readers,—he found on the\ntable there Louis XVIII.’s half-filled snuff-box,—scarcely had this\noccurred when Marseilles began, in spite of the authorities, to\nrekindle the flames of civil war, always smouldering in the south, and\nit required but little to excite the populace to acts of far greater\nviolence than the shouts and insults with which they assailed the\nroyalists whenever they ventured abroad.\n\n0159m\n\n\n\nOwing to this change, the worthy shipowner became at that moment—we\nwill not say all powerful, because Morrel was a prudent and rather a\ntimid man, so much so, that many of the most zealous partisans of\nBonaparte accused him of “moderation”—but sufficiently influential to\nmake a demand in favor of Dantès.\n\nVillefort retained his place, but his marriage was put off until a more\nfavorable opportunity. If the emperor remained on the throne, Gérard\nrequired a different alliance to aid his career; if Louis XVIII.\nreturned, the influence of M. de Saint-Méran, like his own, could be\nvastly increased, and the marriage be still more suitable. The deputy\nprocureur was, therefore, the first magistrate of Marseilles, when one\nmorning his door opened, and M. Morrel was announced.\n\nAnyone else would have hastened to receive him; but Villefort was a man\nof ability, and he knew this would be a sign of weakness. He made\nMorrel wait in the antechamber, although he had no one with him, for\nthe simple reason that the king’s procureur always makes everyone wait,\nand after passing a quarter of an hour in reading the papers, he\nordered M. Morrel to be admitted.\n\nMorrel expected Villefort would be dejected; he found him as he had\nfound him six weeks before, calm, firm, and full of that glacial\npoliteness, that most insurmountable barrier which separates the\nwell-bred from the vulgar man.\n\nHe had entered Villefort’s office expecting that the magistrate would\ntremble at the sight of him; on the contrary, he felt a cold shudder\nall over him when he saw Villefort sitting there with his elbow on his\ndesk, and his head leaning on his hand. He stopped at the door;\nVillefort gazed at him as if he had some difficulty in recognizing him;\nthen, after a brief interval, during which the honest shipowner turned\nhis hat in his hands,\n\n“M. Morrel, I believe?” said Villefort.\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“Come nearer,” said the magistrate, with a patronizing wave of the\nhand, “and tell me to what circumstance I owe the honor of this visit.”\n\n“Do you not guess, monsieur?” asked Morrel.\n\n“Not in the least; but if I can serve you in any way I shall be\ndelighted.”\n", "label": "CONTRADICT"}

Our scheme has succeeded! My dear Helena, my brave\ncompanions, we are now dead and buried; but this evening we will\nrevive, we will leave our tomb, and flee from these barbarous tribes!\"\n\nIt would be difficult to describe the joy that reigned within the\npalisade. Hope had reanimated all hearts. These courageous travelers\nforgot their past trials, dreaded not the future, and only rejoiced in\ntheir present deliverance; although very little reflection would show\nhow difficult was the task of reaching an European settlement from\ntheir present position. But if Kai-Koumou was outwitted, they believed\nthemselves safe from all the savages of New Zealand.\n\nA whole day must pass before the decisive attempt could be made, and\nthey employed their time in arranging a plan of escape. Paganel had\npreserved his map of New Zealand, and could therefore search out the\nsafest routes.\n\nAfter some discussion, the fugitives resolved to proceed eastward\ntowards the Bay of Plenty. This course would lead them through\ndistricts that were very rarely visited. The travelers, who were\nalready accustomed to overcoming natural difficulties, only feared\nmeeting the Maoris. They therefore determined to avoid them at all\nhazards, and gain the eastern coast, where the missionaries have\nfounded several establishments. Moreover, this portion of the island\nhad hitherto escaped the ravages of the war and the depredations of the\nnatives. As for the distance that separated Lake Taupo from the Bay of\nPlenty, it could not be more than one hundred miles. Ten days would\nsuffice for the journey. The missions once reached, they could rest\nthere, and wait for some favorable opportunity of gaining Auckland,\ntheir destination.\n\nThese points being settled, they continued to watch the savages till\nevening. Not one of them remained at the foot of the mountain, and\nwhen darkness invaded the valleys of the lake, no fire betokened the\npresence of the Maoris at the base of the peak. The coast was clear.\n\nAt nine o'clock it was dark night, and Glenarvan gave the signal for\ndeparture. His companions and he, armed and equipped at Kara-Tété's\nexpense, began to cautiously descend the slopes of the Maunganamu.\nCaptain Mangles and Wilson led the way, with eyes and ears on the\nalert. They stopped at the least sound,--they examined the faintest\nlight; each slid down the declivity, the better to elude detection.\n\nTwo hundred feet below the summit, Captain Mangles and his sailor\nreached the dangerous ridge that had been so obstinately guarded by the\nnatives. If, unfortunately, the Maoris, more crafty than the fugitives,\nhad feigned a retreat to entice them within reach, if they had not\nbeen deceived by the eruption, their presence would be discovered\nat this point. Glenarvan, in spite of his confidence and Paganel's\npleasantries, could not help trembling. The safety of his friends was\nat stake during the few moments necessary to cross the ridge. He felt\nLady Helena's heart beat as she clung to his arm.\n\nBut neither he nor Captain Mangles thought of retreating. The young\ncaptain, followed by the others, and favored by the dense obscurity,\ncrawled along the narrow path, only stopping when some detached stone\nrolled to the base of the mountain. If the savages were still in\nambush, these unusual sounds would provoke from each side a formidable\nvolley.\n\nHowever, in gliding like serpents along this inclined crest, the\nfugitives could not advance rapidly.

Kai-Koumou came out of his house, and, surrounded by\nthe principal warriors of his tribe, took his place on a mound several\nfeet high in the centre of the fortification.

The two women were resigned to their fate, while\nthe men concealed their anguish beneath a calmness that showed\nsuperhuman self-control.

Glenarvan cast\na rapid glance around him. The crowd opened, and a warrior, dripping\nwith sweat and overcome with fatigue, appeared.\n\nAs soon as Kai-Koumou perceived him, he said in English, evidently that\nhe might be understood by the captives:\n\n\"You come from the camp of the pale-faces?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the Maori.\n\n\"You saw the prisoner, our Tohonga?\"\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n\"Is he living?\"\n\n\"He is dead! The English have shot him.\"\n\nThe fate of Glenarvan and his companions was settled.\n\n\"You shall all die to-morrow at daybreak!\" cried Kai-Koumou.\n\nThe unfortunates were therefore to suffer a common death. Lady Helena\nand Mary Grant raised towards heaven a look of thankfulness.\n\nThe captives were not taken back to the temple. They were to attend\nthat day the funeral of the dead chief, and the bloody ceremonies\nconnected therewith. A party of natives conducted them to the foot of\nan enormous koudi, where these guardians remained without losing sight\nof their prisoners. The rest of the tribe, absorbed in their official\nmourning, seemed to have forgotten them.\n\nThe customary three days had elapsed since the death of Kara-Tété. The\nsoul of the deceased had therefore forever abandoned its mortal abode.\nThe sacred rites began.\n\nThe body was carried to a small mound in the centre of the\nfortification, clothed in splendid costume, and enveloped in a\nmagnificent flaxen mat.

They mourned the dead in plaintive and modulated cadences. His\nrelations struck their heads together; his kinswomen lacerated their\nfaces with their nails, and showed themselves more lavish of blood than\nof tears.

Chance threw us in his way. He heard Glenarvan's story of the\nshipwreck, and, like a bold man, he promptly decided to take part in\nthe expedition. At the Wimerra he communicated with one of his friends,\nthe farrier of Black Point, and thus left distinguishable traces of\nour course. His band followed us. A poisonous plant enabled him to\ngradually kill our oxen and horses. Then, at the proper moment, he\nentangled us in the marshes of the Snowy, and surrendered us to the\nconvicts he commanded.\"\n\nEverything possible had been said concerning Ben Joyce. His past had\njust been reviewed by the major, and the wretch appeared as he was,--a\nbold and formidable criminal. His intentions had been clearly proved,\nand required, on the part of Glenarvan, extreme vigilance. Fortunately,\nthere was less to fear from the detected bandit than the secret traitor.\n\nBut one serious fact appeared from this explanation. No one had yet\nthought of it; only Mary Grant, disregarding the past, looked forward\nto the future. Captain Mangles first saw her pale and disconsolate.

A few boldly-struck chords wafted\nto his ears their harmonious vibrations.

Between the shores of South America and the\nlittle speck in the ocean known by the name of Tristan d'Acunha, there\nwas no probability of her meeting with any strange sail; and under some\ncircumstances, or in some company, the days might have been monotonous\nand the hours might have hung wearily. But so ardent was the desire\nfor success, and so accomplished, yet varied, were the characters of\nthose who composed the little assembly, that the voyage on the South\nAtlantic, though devoid of striking incident, was by no means wanting\nin interest. Much of the time was spent on deck, where the ladies'\ncabins were now located, Mary Grant especially training her hand, head,\nand heart in feeling, thought, and action. The geographer set to work\non a composition entitled \"Travels of a Geographer on the Argentine\nPampas;\" but many a blank page did he leave. Tho Scottish peer (when\ntired of examining for the thousandth time all that belonged to his\nyacht) could look at the books and documents which he had brought with\nhim, intending to peruse them carefully. And as to the major he was\nnever in company and never out of company; his cigar insured, nothing\nelse was wanted.\n\nEver and anon many miles of the ocean would be covered by masses of\nsea-weed; these different species of algæ would afford subject for\nresearch; specimens must be preserved, authorities must be consulted,\nand as one result at least all would become wiser. Then a discussion\nwould ensue on some geographical problem, and maps that were not\nattainable were of course appealed to by each disputant, though the\nsubject in question was often of very trivial moment. It was in the\nmidst of a debate of this kind, during the evening, that a sailor cried\nout,--\n\n\"Land ahead!\"\n\n\"In what direction?\" asked Paganel.\n\n\"To windward,\" replied the sailor.\n\nThe landsmen's eyes were strained, but to no purpose.

Is\nnot that the distance from which this mountain is visible?\"\n\n\"Exactly so,\" replied the captain.\n\nA few hours brought them much nearer to the group of high and steep\nrocks, and at sunrise they saw the conical peak of Tristan, seemingly\nseparated from all the rest of the rocky group, and reflecting the\nglory of the blue heavens and of the rising orb on the pla", "label": "NEUTRAL"}

Yes, I heard this news, and knew it even before you could; for\nthree days ago I posted from Marseilles to Paris with all possible\nspeed, half-desperate at the enforced delay.”\n\n“Three days ago?

He strove to collect a band of\nfollowers, and followed the footsteps of Decesaris and Gasparone, whom\nhe hoped to surpass. Many young men of Palestrina, Frascati, and\nPampinara had disappeared. Their disappearance at first caused much\ndisquietude; but it was soon known that they had joined Cucumetto.\nAfter some time Cucumetto became the object of universal attention; the\nmost extraordinary traits of ferocious daring and brutality were\nrelated of him.\n\n“One day he carried off a young girl, the daughter of a surveyor of\nFrosinone. The bandit’s laws are positive; a young girl belongs first\nto him who carries her off, then the rest draw lots for her, and she is\nabandoned to their brutality until death relieves her sufferings. When\ntheir parents are sufficiently rich to pay a ransom, a messenger is\nsent to negotiate; the prisoner is hostage for the security of the\nmessenger; should the ransom be refused, the prisoner is irrevocably\nlost. The young girl’s lover was in Cucumetto’s troop; his name was\nCarlini. When she recognized her lover, the poor girl extended her arms\nto him, and believed herself safe; but Carlini felt his heart sink, for\nhe but too well knew the fate that awaited her. However, as he was a\nfavorite with Cucumetto, as he had for three years faithfully served\nhim, and as he had saved his life by shooting a dragoon who was about\nto cut him down, he hoped the chief would have pity on him. He took\nCucumetto one side, while the young girl, seated at the foot of a huge\npine that stood in the centre of the forest, made a veil of her\npicturesque head-dress to hide her face from the lascivious gaze of the\nbandits. There he told the chief all—his affection for the prisoner,\ntheir promises of mutual fidelity, and how every night, since he had\nbeen near, they had met in some neighboring ruins.\n\n20109m\n\n\n\n“It so happened that night that Cucumetto had sent Carlini to a\nvillage, so that he had been unable to go to the place of meeting.\nCucumetto had been there, however, by accident, as he said, and had\ncarried the maiden off. Carlini besought his chief to make an exception\nin Rita’s favor, as her father was rich, and could pay a large ransom.\nCucumetto seemed to yield to his friend’s entreaties, and bade him find\na shepherd to send to Rita’s father at Frosinone.\n\n“Carlini flew joyfully to Rita, telling her she was saved, and bidding\nher write to her father, to inform him what had occurred, and that her\nransom was fixed at three hundred piastres. Twelve hours’ delay was all\nthat was granted—that is, until nine the next morning. The instant the\nletter was written, Carlini seized it, and hastened to the plain to\nfind a messenger. He found a young shepherd watching his flock. The\nnatural messengers of the bandits are the shepherds who live between\nthe city and the mountains, between civilized and savage life. The boy\nundertook the commission, promising to be in Frosinone in less than an\nhour. Carlini returned, anxious to see his mistress, and announce the\njoyful intelligence. He found the troop in the glade, supping off the\nprovisions exacted as contributions from the peasants; but his eye\nvainly sought Rita and Cucumetto among them.\n\n“He inquired where they were, and was answered by a burst of laughter.\nA cold perspiration burst from every pore, and his hair stood on end.\nHe repeated his question. One of the bandits rose, and offered him a\nglass filled with Orvietto, saying, ‘To the health of the brave\nCucumetto and the fair Rita.’ At this moment Carlini heard a woman’s\ncry; he divined the truth, seized the glass, broke it across the face\nof him who presented it, and rushed towards the spot whence the cry\ncame. After a hundred yards he turned the corner of the thicket; he\nfound Rita senseless in the arms of Cucumetto. At the sight of Carlini,\nCucumetto rose, a pistol in each hand.

Doubtless,\nsome chiefs of the Maori tribe had fallen into the hands of the\nEnglish, and the natives would attempt to recover them by way of\nexchange; their situation, therefore, was not one for despair.\n\nMeantime the canoe rapidly ascended the river. Paganel, whose\nchangeable disposition carried him from one extreme to another, had\nregained his hopefulness. He believed that the Maoris were sparing them\nthe fatigue of their journey to the English settlements, and that they\nwere certain to arrive at their destination. He was, therefore, quite\nresigned to his lot, and traced on his map the course of the Waikato\nacross the plains and valleys of the province. Lady Helena and Mary\nGrant, suppressing their terror, conversed in low tones with Glenarvan,\nand the most skillful physiognomist could not have detected on their\nfaces the anxiety of their hearts.\n\nThe Waikato River is worshiped by the natives, as Paganel knew, and\nEnglish and German naturalists have never ascended beyond its junction\nwith the Waipa. Whither did Kai-Koumou intend to take his captives?\nThe geographer could not have guessed if the word \"Taupo,\" frequently\nrepeated, had not attracted his attention. By consulting his map,\nhe saw that this name was applied to a celebrated lake in the most\nmountainous part of the island, and that from it the Waikato flows.\n\nPaganel, addressing Captain Mangles in French, so as not to be\nunderstood by the savages, asked him how fast the canoe was going. The\ncaptain thought about three miles an hour.\n\n\"Then,\" replied the geographer, \"if we do not travel during the night,\nour voyage to the lake will last about four days.\"\n\n\"But whereabouts are the English garrisons?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"It is difficult to say,\" replied Paganel. \"At all events, the war\nmust have reached the province of Taranaki, and probably the troops\nare collected beyond the mountains, on the side of the lake where the\nhabitations of the savages are concentrated.\"\n\n\"God grant it!\" said Lady Helena.\n\nGlenarvan cast a sorrowful glance at his young wife and Mary Grant,\nexposed to the mercy of these fierce natives, and captives in a wild\ncountry, far from all human assistance. But he saw that he was watched\nby Kai-Koumou, and, not wishing to show that one of the captives was\nhis wife, he prudently kept his thoughts to himself, and gazed at the\nbanks of the river with apparent indifference.\n\n[Sidenote: ACCESSIONS, AND PROGRESS.]\n\nThe sun was just sinking below the horizon as the canoe ran upon a bank\nof pumice-stones, which the Waikato carries with it from its source\nin the volcanic mountains. Several trees grew here, as if designed to\nshelter an encampment. Kai-Koumou landed his prisoners.\n\nThe men had their hands tied, the ladies were free. All were placed\nin the centre of the encampment, around which large fires formed an\nimpassable barrier.\n\nBefore Kai-Koumou had informed his captives of his intention to\nexchange them, Glenarvan and Captain Mangles had discussed various\nmethods of recovering their liberty. What they could not venture in the\nboat they hoped to attempt on land, at the hour for encamping, under\ncover of the night.\n\nBut since Glenarvan's conversation with the chief, it seemed wise to\nabandon this design. They must be patient. It was the most prudent\nplan. The exchange offered chances that neither an open attack nor a\nflight across these unknown regions could afford. Many circumstances\nmight indeed arise that would delay, and even prevent, such a\ntransaction; but still it was better to await the result. What,\nmoreover, could ten defenceless men do against thirty well-armed\nsavages? Besides, Glenarvan thought it likely that Kai-Koumou's tribe\nhad lost some chief of high rank whom they were particularly anxious to\nrecover; and he was not mistaken.\n\nThe next day the canoe ascended the river with increased swiftness.\nIt stopped for a moment at the junction of a small river which wound\nacross the plains on the right bank.

I was\narrested and became a prisoner because, under the arbor of La Réserve,\nthe day before I was to marry you, a man named Danglars wrote this\nletter, which the fisherman Fernand himself posted.”\n\nMonte Cristo went to a secretaire, opened a drawer by a spring, from\nwhich he took a paper which had lost its original color, and the ink of\nwhich had become of a rusty hue—this he placed in the hands of\nMercédès. It was Danglars’ letter to the king’s attorney, which the\nCount of Monte Cristo, disguised as a clerk from the house of Thomson &\nFrench, had taken from the file against Edmond Dantès, on the day he\nhad paid the two hundred thousand francs to M. de Boville. Mercédès\nread with terror the following lines:\n\n“The king’s attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and religion\nthat one Edmond Dantès, second in command on board the _Pharaon_, this\nday arrived from Smyrna, after having touched at Naples and\nPorto-Ferrajo, is the bearer of a letter from Murat to the usurper, and\nof another letter from the usurper to the Bonapartist club in Paris.\nAmple corroboration of this statement may be obtained by arresting the\nabove-mentioned Edmond Dantès, who either carries the letter for Paris\nabout with him, or has it at his father’s abode. Should it not be found\nin possession of either father or son, then it will assuredly be\ndiscovered in the cabin belonging to the said Dantès on board the\n_Pharaon_.”\n\n\n“How dreadful!” said Mercédès, passing her hand across her brow, moist\nwith perspiration; “and that letter——”\n\n“I bought it for two hundred thousand francs, madame,” said Monte\nCristo; “but that is a trifle, since it enables me to justify myself to\nyou.”\n\n“And the result of that letter——”\n\n“You well know, madame, was my arrest; but you do not know how long\nthat arrest lasted. You do not know that I remained for fourteen years\nwithin a quarter of a league of you, in a dungeon in the Château d’If.\nYou do not know that every day of those fourteen years I renewed the\nvow of vengeance which I had made the first day; and yet I was not\naware that you had married Fernand, my calumniator, and that my father\nhad died of hunger!”\n\n“Can it be?” cried Mercédès, shuddering.\n\n“That is what I heard on leaving my prison fourteen years after I had\nentered it; and that is why, on account of the living Mercédès and my\ndeceased father, I have sworn to revenge myself on Fernand, and—I have\nrevenged myself.”\n\n“And you are sure the unhappy Fernand did that?”\n\n“I am satisfied, madame, that he did what I have told you; besides,\nthat is not much more odious than that a Frenchman by adoption should\npass over to the English; that a Spaniard by birth should have fought\nagainst the Spaniards; that a stipendiary of Ali should have betrayed\nand murdered Ali.

Fortunately, the Guamini flowed at no great distance.\nThey accordingly continued their journey, and at seven o'clock in the\nmorning the little party arrived at the ramada. On seeing its entrance\nstrewn with the bodies of the wolves, it was easy to understand the\nviolence of the attack and the vigor of the defense. The travelers,\nafter fully quenching their thirst, devoted their attention to\nbreakfast in the inclosure. The ostrich-steaks were declared excellent,\nand the armadillo, roasted in its own covering, was a delicious dish.\n\n\"To eat reasonably of this,\" said Paganel, \"would be ingratitude\ntowards Providence. We really must eat immoderately.\"\n\nAnd he did so accordingly,--but was not sick, thanks to the clear water\nof the Guamini, which appeared to possess superior digestive properties.\n\n[Sidenote: AEROSTATIC EXPERIMENTS.]\n\nAt ten o'clock Glenarvan gave the signal for departure. The\nwater-bottles were filled, and they set out. The horses, being greatly\nrevived, evinced much spirit, and maintained an easy and almost\ncontinuous canter. The next morning they crossed the boundary which\nseparates the Argentine Plains from the Pampas. Here Thalcave hoped\nto meet the chiefs in whose hands he doubted not that he should find\nHarry Grant and rescue him and his two companions from slavery.\n\nSince they had left the Guamini, the travelers noticed, with great\nsatisfaction, a considerable change in the temperature, thanks to the\ncold winds of Patagonia, which cause continual currents of air. Neither\nman nor beast had any reason to complain, after suffering so much from\ndryness and heat. They therefore pushed on with courage and confidence.\nBut, whatever might have been said, the country seemed to be entirely\nuninhabited, or, to use a more exact word, \"disinhabited.\"\n\nFrequently they skirted the shores of fresh-water lagoons, on whose\nbanks, in the shelter of the bushes, tiny wrens skipped and melodious\nlarks warbled, in company with the brilliant-plumaged tanagers. These\npretty birds gayly fluttered about, heedless of the haughty starlings\nthat strutted on the banks like soldiers with their epaulettes and red\nbreasts. In the thorny coppices the nests of the annubis swung like\nhammocks, and on the shores of the lagoons magnificent flamingoes,\nmarching in regular file, spread their fiery-colored wings to the wind.\nTheir nests were seen, by thousands together, like a small village, in\nthe shape of truncated cones a foot high. The birds were not startled\nat the approach of the travelers, which was contrary to Paganel's\ncalculations.\n\n\"I have been curious for a long time,\" said he to the major, \"to see a\nflamingo fly.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said MacNabb.\n\n\"Now, since I have an opportunity, I shall profit by it.\"\n\n\"Do so, Paganel.\"\n\n\"Come with me, major, and you too, Robert; I need witnesses.\"\n\nAnd Paganel, leaving his companions to go on, proceeded towards the\nflock of flamingoes, followed by Robert and the major.

Glenarvan, a\nprey to unspeakable emotion, did not venture a word; while the major\nnodded his head with an air of genuine satisfaction.\n\n\"And now, my friends,\" said Paganel, \"if these brutes expect us to test\ntheir patience they are mistaken.

He\nwrapped himself gloomily in his great flaxen mantle, and seemed to shun\ntoo inquisitive looks. However, when they were all seated around him at\nthe foot of the tomb, he related his experiences.\n\nAfter the death of Kara-Tété, Paganel had taken advantage, like Robert,\nof the confusion of the natives, and escaped from the pah. But less\nfortunate than young Grant, he had fallen upon an encampment of Maoris,\nwho were commanded by a chief of fine form and intelligent appearance,\nwho was evidently superior to all the warriors of his tribe. This chief\nspoke English accurately, and bade him welcome by rubbing his nose\nagainst that of the geographer. Paganel wondered whether he should\nconsider himself a prisoner; but seeing that he could not take a step\nwithout being graciously accompanied by the chief, he soon knew how\nmatters stood on this point.\n\nThe chief, whose name was \"Hihy\" (sunbeam), was not a bad man. The\nspectacles and telescope gave him a high opinion of Paganel, whom he\nattached carefully to his person, not only by his benefits, but by\nstrong flaxen ropes, especially at night.\n\nThis novel situation lasted three long days. Was he well or badly\ntreated? Both, as he stated without further explanation. In short, he\nwas a prisoner, and, except for the prospect of immediate torture,\nhis condition did not seem more enviable than that of his unfortunate\nfriends.\n\nFortunately, last night he succeeded in biting asunder his ropes and\nescaping. He had witnessed at a distance the burial of the chief,\nknew that he had been interred on the summit of Maunganamu mountain,\nand that it was tabooed in consequence. He therefore resolved to take\nrefuge there, not wishing to leave the place where his companions were\nheld captives. He succeeded in his undertaking, arrived at Kara-Tété's\ntomb, and waited in hope that Providence would in some way deliver his\nfriends.\n\nSuch was Paganel's story. Did he omit designedly any circumstance\nof his stay among the natives? More than once his embarrassment led\nthem to suspect so. However that might be, he received unanimous\ncongratulations; and as the past was now known, they returned to the\npresent.\n\nTheir situation was still exceedingly critical. The natives, if they\ndid not venture to climb the mountain, expected that hunger and thirst\nwould force their prisoners to surrender. It was only a matter of time,\nand the savages had great patience. Glenarvan did not disregard the\ndifficulties of his position, but waited for the favorable issue which\nProvidence seemed to promise.\n\nAnd first he wished to examine this improvised fortress; not to defend\nit, for an attack was not to be feared, but that he might find a way of\nescaping. The major and the captain, Robert, Paganel, and himself, took\nthe exact bearings of the mountain. They observed the direction of the\npaths, their branches and declivities.

Is it not\na mere joke? Have I done this? It is the confusion of languages, as at\nBabel. My friends! my friends! to start for India and arrive at Chili!\nto learn Spanish and speak Portuguese! this is too much, and, if it\ncontinues, I shall some day throw myself out of the window instead of\nmy cigar.\"\n\nTo hear Paganel take his blunder thus, to see his comical actions, it\nwas impossible to keep serious. Besides, he set the example himself.\n\n\"Laugh, my friends,\" said he, \"laugh with a will! you cannot laugh as\nmuch as I do at myself.\"\n\nAnd he uttered the most formidable peal of laughter that ever issued\nfrom the mouth of a geographer.\n\n\"But we are none the less without an interpreter,\" said the major.\n\n\"Oh, do not be troubled,\" replied Paganel. \"The Portuguese and Spanish\nresemble each other so much that I made a mistake. However, this very\nresemblance will soon enable me to rectify my error, and in a short\ntime I will thank this worthy Patagonian in the language he speaks so\nwell.\"\n\nPaganel was right, for he could soon exchange a few words with the\nnative. He even learned that his name was Thalcave, a word which\nsignifies in Araucanian \"the thunderer.\" This surname was doubtless\ngiven to him for his skill in the use of fire-arms.\n\n[Sidenote: BETTER PROSPECTS.]\n\nBut Glenarvan was particularly rejoiced to discover that the Patagonian\nwas a guide, and, moreover, a guide of the Pampas. There was,\ntherefore, something so providential in this meeting that the success\nof the enterprise seemed already an accomplished fact, and no one any\nlonger doubted the rescue of Captain Grant.\n\nIn the meantime the travelers and the Patagonian had returned to\nRobert. The latter stretched his arms towards the native, who, without\na word, placed his hand upon his head. He examined the child and felt\nhis wounded limbs. Then, smiling, he went and gathered on the banks\nof the stream a few handfuls of wild celery, with which he rubbed the\nboy's body. Under this treatment, performed with an extreme gentleness,\nthe child felt his strength revive, and it was plain that a few hours\nwould suffice to restore him.\n\nIt was therefore decided that that day and the following night should\nbe passed at the encampment.

The line of the thirty-seventh parallel, on which they\nwere traveling, led them through the diggings and municipality of Mount\nAlexander, which was one of the most successful spots for the digger at\nthe commencement of the gold fever, in consequence of the comparatively\nlevel nature of the ground and the general richness of the soil, so\ndifferent from some other localities where only once in a while was\nsome enormous nugget to be found. As they drew near to the streets of\nthis hastily-built town, Ayrton and Mulready, who were in charge of the\ncart, were sent forward, whilst the others walked through the place to\ninspect what there might be of interest, as well as to ascertain what\nmight be learned concerning the object of their expedition.\n\nThus, in this strange gathering of all nationalities and creeds and\nprofessions, the regular inhabitants beheld a still more extraordinary\nsight than that every day afforded them: folks who to the refinement\nwhich education and civilization give added both the earnestness\nof the worker and the freshness and vigor of the pleasure-seeking\ntourist. In the streets, in connection with the strange sign-boards and\nannouncements, the novel erections and purposes to which some of them\nwere adapted, Paganel had a history and commentary for every one.\n\nStill more did he expatiate upon the thousand-and-one topics of\ninterest when they visited the bank building, which here is the\ncentre of more than one agency connected with this great gold-bearing\ndistrict.

Then the king, who,\nwithout our suspecting it, had overheard our conversation, interrupted\nus by saying, ‘Villefort’—observe that the king did not pronounce the\nword Noirtier, but, on the contrary, placed considerable emphasis on\nthat of Villefort—‘Villefort,’ said his majesty, ‘is a young man of\ngreat judgment and discretion, who will be sure to make a figure in his\nprofession; I like him much, and it gave me great pleasure to hear that\nhe was about to become the son-in-law of the Marquis and Marquise de\nSaint-Méran. I should myself have recommended the match, had not the\nnoble marquis anticipated my wishes by requesting my consent to it.’”\n\n“Is it possible the king could have condescended so far as to express\nhimself so favorably of me?” asked the enraptured Villefort.\n\n“I give you his very words; and if the marquis chooses to be candid, he\nwill confess that they perfectly agree with what his majesty said to\nhim, when he went six months ago to consult him upon the subject of\nyour espousing his daughter.”\n\n0091m\n\n\n\n“That is true,” answered the marquis.\n\n“How much do I owe this gracious prince! What is there I would not do\nto evince my earnest gratitude!”\n\n“That is right,” cried the marquise. “I love to see you thus. Now,\nthen, were a conspirator to fall into your hands, he would be most\nwelcome.”\n\n“For my part, dear mother,” interposed Renée, “I trust your wishes will\nnot prosper, and that Providence will only permit petty offenders, poor\ndebtors, and miserable cheats to fall into M. de Villefort’s\nhands,—then I shall be contented.”\n\n“Just the same as though you prayed that a physician might only be\ncalled upon to prescribe for headaches, measles, and the stings of\nwasps, or any other slight affection of the epidermis. If you wish to\nsee me the king’s attorney, you must desire for me some of those\nviolent and dangerous diseases from the cure of which so much honor\nredounds to the physician.”\n\nAt this moment, and as though the utterance of Villefort’s wish had\nsufficed to effect its accomplishment, a servant entered the room, and\nwhispered a few words in his ear. Villefort immediately rose from table\nand quitted the room upon the plea of urgent business; he soon,\nhowever, returned, his whole face beaming with delight. Renée regarded\nhim with fond affection; and certainly his handsome features, lit up as\nthey then were with more than usual fire and animation, seemed formed\nto excite the innocent admiration with which she gazed on her graceful\nand intelligent lover.\n\n“You were wishing just now,” said Villefort, addressing her, “that I\nwere a doctor instead of a lawyer. Well, I at least resemble the\ndisciples of Esculapius in one thing [people spoke in this style in\n1815], that of not being able to call a day my own, not even that of my\nbetrothal.”\n\n“And wherefore were you called away just now?” asked Mademoiselle de\nSaint-Méran, with an air of deep interest.\n\n“For a very serious matter, which bids fair to make work for the\nexecutioner.”\n\n“How dreadful!” exclaimed Renée, turning pale.\n\n“Is it possible?” burst simultaneously from all who were near enough to\nthe magistrate to hear his words.\n\n“Why, if my information prove correct, a sort of Bonapartist conspiracy\nhas just been discovered.”\n\n“Can I believe my ears?” cried the marquise.\n\n“I will read you the letter containing the accusation, at least,” said\nVillefort:\n\n“‘The king’s attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and the\nreligious institutions of his country, that one named Edmond Dantès,\nmate of the ship _Pharaon_, this day arrived from Smyrna, after having\ntouched at Naples and Porto-Ferrajo, has been the bearer of a letter\nfrom Mur", "label": "NEUTRAL"}

M. Noirtier then took the trouble to close and bolt the\nantechamber door, then that of the bedchamber, and then extended his\nhand to Villefort, who had followed all his motions with surprise which\nhe could not conceal.\n\n“Well, now, my dear Gérard,” said he to the young man, with a very\nsignificant look, “do you know, you seem as if you were not very glad\nto see me?”\n\n“My dear father,” said Villefort, “I am, on the contrary, delighted;\nbut I so little expected your visit, that it has somewhat overcome me.”\n\n“But, my dear fellow,” replied M.

Glenarvan, pushing back MacNabb,\nwas advancing along the path, when, not far from the cart, these words\nwere uttered:\n\n\"Help! help!\"\n\nIt was a plaintive and despairing voice. Captain Mangles and the major\nrushed towards it. In a few moments they perceived, on the edge of\nthe coppice, a human form that was dragging itself along and groaning\npiteously. It was Mulready, wounded and half dead. When his companions\nraised him, they felt their hands dabbling in blood. The rain now\nincreased, and the wind howled through the branches of the dead trees.\nIn the midst of these terrific gusts, Glenarvan, the major, and the\ncaptain bore the body of Mulready.\n\nOn arriving at the cart, Paganel, Robert, Wilson, and Olbinett came\nout, and Lady Helena gave up her room to the poor sailor. The major\ntook off Mulready's vest, wet with blood and rain. He discovered the\nwound. It was a poniard stab, which the unfortunate had received in his\nright side.\n\nMacNabb dressed it skillfully. Whether the weapon had reached the vital\nparts, he could not say. A stream of bright-red blood spurted forth,\nwhile the paleness and the swoon of the wounded man proved that he had\nbeen seriously injured. The major accordingly placed upon the opening\nof the wound, after first washing it with fresh water, a thick wad of\ntinder, and then a few layers of lint, confined by a bandage, and thus\nsucceeded in stopping the hemorrhage. The patient was then laid on his\nside, his head and breast raised, and Lady Helena gave him a refreshing\ndraught.\n\nAt the end of a quarter of an hour, the wounded man, who had been\nmotionless till then, made a movement. His eyes half opened, his lips\nmurmured disconnected words, and the major, putting down his ear, heard\nhim say:\n\n\"My lord--the letter--Ben Joyce----\"\n\n[Sidenote: A DAY OF DOUBT.]\n\nThe major repeated these words, and glanced at his companions. What did\nMulready mean? Ben Joyce had attacked the sailor, but why? Was it not\nsimply for the purpose of preventing him from reaching the Duncan? This\nletter--Glenarvan examined the sailor's pockets. The letter addressed\nto Tom Austin was gone.\n\nThe night passed in anxiety and anguish. They feared every moment that\nthe wounded man would die. A burning fever consumed him. Lady Helena\nand Mary Grant, as though his sisters, did not leave him; never was\npatient better nursed, or by more tender hands.\n\nDay appeared. The rain had ceased. Heavy clouds still rolled along\nthe vault of the sky, and the earth was strewn with the fragments of\nbranches. The clay, soaked by floods of water, had yielded; and the\nsides of the cart became unsteady, but sank no deeper.\n\nCaptain Mangles, Paganel, and Glenarvan took a tour of exploration\naround the camp. They traversed the path still marked with blood, but\nfound no trace of Ben Joyce or his band. They went to the place where\nthe attack had been made. Here two corpses lay on the ground, shot\nby Mulready. One was the farrier of Black Point. His face, which had\nmortified, was a horrible sight.\n\nGlenarvan did not pursue his investigations farther, prudence\nforbidding. He therefore returned to the cart, much alarmed by the\nseriousness of the situation.\n\n\"We cannot think of sending another messenger to Melbourne,\" said he.\n\n\"But we must,\" replied Captain Mangles; \"and I will make the attempt,\nsince my sailor has failed.\"\n\n\"No, John.

Then, in addition to the usual\noperations of a banking establishment, it was here that the ore was\nstored, from hence that it was sent, under government escort and with\ngovernment guarantee, subject to a fixed, though moderate, charge,\nso that the transport to Melbourne, which at first was a dangerous\nand expensive \"middle passage,\" was now as easily and inexpensively\naccomplished as is the transmission of freight from London to Paris.\n\n[Illustration: In the streets, in connection with the strange\nsign-boards and announcements, the novel erections and purposes to\nwhich some of them were adapted, Paganel had a history and commentary\nfor every one.]\n\nOver the whole of this establishment they were conducted by the most\ncourteous and obliging of officials, and the services thus rendered\ncharmed the Frenchman, who was none the less loquacious, and was in\ntruth able even to enlighten his guides.\n\n[Illustration: Here was the mineralogical museum, in which might be\nseen specimens illustrative of all the various ways in which the gold\nhas been found.]\n\n[Sidenote: PLEASING PROGRESS.]\n\nBut his joy culminated when, after some time spent in the hotel, the\nparty left the town, and passed through the \"diggings,\" properly so\ncalled.

All this was\ndone with such a mingling of childish good-nature and scientific and\nnational pride that it was useless to do anything but laugh, and an\nirrepressible smile came over even the major's features. At length,\nhowever, by drawing him into a lecture, they succeeded in persuading\nhim to follow them; and, as they left the diggings, he told them the\nhistory of the prophecies, the discovery, and the spread of knowledge\nas to the rich auriferous deposits of this part of Australia. He\ncould give them facts and incidents and dates as to the ingress into\nMelbourne, and the exodus therefrom to the diggings, in the year 1852;\nhe told them how the energy and the love of order which characterize\nthe English-speaking peoples had reduced to system, method,\nsubordination, the chaotic surgings and restlessness which marked the\nfirst weeks and months of this new era; and he detailed, as though\nhe had studied the subject to the entire neglect of other matters,\nthe working of the system,--how the land was registered, what was the\nsum paid in the aggregate, how the taxes were collected, wherein the\nsystem had been found faulty.

It\nis a rock of almost conical form, which looks as though it had been\nthrust up by volcanic force from the depth to the surface of the ocean.\nDantès drew a plan of the island for Faria, and Faria gave Dantès\nadvice as to the means he should employ to recover the treasure. But\nDantès was far from being as enthusiastic and confident as the old man.\nIt was past a question now that Faria was not a lunatic, and the way in\nwhich he had achieved the discovery, which had given rise to the\nsuspicion of his madness, increased Edmond’s admiration of him; but at\nthe same time Dantès could not believe that the deposit, supposing it\nhad ever existed, still existed; and though he considered the treasure\nas by no means chimerical, he yet believed it was no longer there.\n\nHowever, as if fate resolved on depriving the prisoners of their last\nchance, and making them understand that they were condemned to\nperpetual imprisonment, a new misfortune befell them; the gallery on\nthe sea side, which had long been in ruins, was rebuilt. They had\nrepaired it completely, and stopped up with vast masses of stone the\nhole Dantès had partly filled in. But for this precaution, which, it\nwill be remembered, the abbé had made to Edmond, the misfortune would\nhave been still greater, for their attempt to escape would have been\ndetected, and they would undoubtedly have been separated. Thus a new, a\nstronger, and more inexorable barrier was interposed to cut off the\nrealization of their hopes.\n\n“You see,” said the young man, with an air of sorrowful resignation, to\nFaria, “that God deems it right to take from me any claim to merit for\nwhat you call my devotion to you.

The major, however, whose short\nabsence no one had noticed, contented himself with listening in\nsilence. The fury of the tempest gave them considerable uneasiness,\nsince it might cause an inundation, by which the cart, fast in the\nmire, would be overwhelmed.\n\n[Illustration: He crouched down, and, after a long and attentive\nobservation, distinctly perceived several men.]\n\nMore than once Mulready, Ayrton, and Captain Mangles went to ascertain\nthe height of the rushing waters, and returned drenched from head to\nfoot.\n\nAt length day appeared. The rain ceased, but the rays of the sun failed\nto penetrate the thick veil of clouds. Large pools of muddy, yellowish\nwater covered the ground. A warm vapor issued from the water-soaked\nearth and saturated the atmosphere with a sickly moisture.\n\nGlenarvan, first of all, turned his attention to the cart. In his eyes,\nthis was their main support. It was imbedded fast in the midst of a\ndeep hollow of sticky clay. The fore wheels were almost entirely out of\nsight, and the hind ones were buried up to the hubs. It would be a very\ndifficult matter to pull out the heavy vehicle, and would undoubtedly\nrequire the united strength of men, oxen, and horses.\n\n\"We must make haste,\" said Captain Mangles. \"If this clay dries, the\nwork will be more difficult.\"\n\nGlenarvan, the two sailors, the captain, and Ayrton then entered the\nwood, where the animals had passed the night.\n\nIt was a tall forest of gloomy gum-trees.

The Hundred Days\n\nM. Noirtier was a true prophet, and things progressed rapidly, as he\nhad predicted. Everyone knows the history of the famous return from\nElba, a return which was unprecedented in the past, and will probably\nremain without a counterpart in the future.\n\nLouis XVIII. made but a faint attempt to parry this unexpected blow;\nthe monarchy he had scarcely reconstructed tottered on its precarious\nfoundation, and at a sign from the emperor the incongruous structure of\nancient prejudices and new ideas fell to the ground. Villefort,\ntherefore, gained nothing save the king’s gratitude (which was rather\nlikely to injure him at the present time) and the cross of the Legion\nof Honor, which he had the prudence not to wear, although M. de Blacas\nhad duly forwarded the brevet.\n\nNapoleon would, doubtless, have deprived Villefort of his office had it\nnot been for Noirtier, who was all powerful at court, and thus the\nGirondin of ’93 and the Senator of 1806 protected him who so lately had\nbeen his protector. All Villefort’s influence barely enabled him to\nstifle the secret Dantès had so nearly divulged. The king’s procureur\nalone was deprived of his office, being suspected of royalism.\n\nHowever, scarcely was the imperial power established—that is, scarcely\nhad the emperor re-entered the Tuileries and begun to issue orders from\nthe closet into which we have introduced our readers,—he found on the\ntable there Louis XVIII.’s half-filled snuff-box,—scarcely had this\noccurred when Marseilles began, in spite of the authorities, to\nrekindle the flames of civil war, always smouldering in the south, and\nit required but little to excite the populace to acts of far greater\nviolence than the shouts and insults with which they assailed the\nroyalists whenever they ventured abroad.\n\n0159m\n\n\n\nOwing to this change, the worthy shipowner became at that moment—we\nwill not say all powerful, because Morrel was a prudent and rather a\ntimid man, so much so, that many of the most zealous partisans of\nBonaparte accused him of “moderation”—but sufficiently influential to\nmake a demand in favor of Dantès.\n\nVillefort retained his place, but his marriage was put off until a more\nfavorable opportunity. If the emperor remained on the throne, Gérard\nrequired a different alliance to aid his career; if Louis XVIII.\nreturned, the influence of M. de Saint-Méran, like his own, could be\nvastly increased, and the marriage be still more suitable. The deputy\nprocureur was, therefore, the first magistrate of Marseilles, when one\nmorning his door opened, and M.

He made\nMorrel wait in the antechamber, although he had no one with him, for\nthe simple reason that the king’s procureur always makes everyone wait,\nand after passing a quarter of an hour in reading the papers, he\nordered M. Morrel to be admitted.\n\nMorrel expected Villefort would be dejected; he found him as he had\nfound him six weeks before, calm, firm, and full of that glacial\npoliteness, that most insurmountable barrier which separates the\nwell-bred from the vulgar man.\n\nHe had entered Villefort’s office expecting that the magistrate would\ntremble at the sight of him; on the contrary, he felt a cold shudder\nall over him when he saw Villefort sitting there with his elbow on his\ndesk, and his head leaning on his hand. He stopped at the door;\nVillefort gazed at him as if he had some difficulty in recognizing him;\nthen, after a brief interval, during which the honest shipowner turned\nhis hat in his hands,\n\n“M. Morrel, I believe?” said Villefort.\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“Come nearer,” said the magistrate, with a patronizing wave of the\nhand, “and tell me to what circumstance I owe the honor of this visit.”\n\n“Do you not guess, monsieur?” asked Morrel.\n\n“Not in the least; but if I can serve you in any way I shall be\ndelighted.”\n", "label": "SUPPORT"}

Glenarvan, pushing back MacNabb,\nwas advancing along the path, when, not far from the cart, these words\nwere uttered:\n\n\"Help! help!\"\n\nIt was a plaintive and despairing voice. Captain Mangles and the major\nrushed towards it. In a few moments they perceived, on the edge of\nthe coppice, a human form that was dragging itself along and groaning\npiteously. It was Mulready, wounded and half dead. When his companions\nraised him, they felt their hands dabbling in blood. The rain now\nincreased, and the wind howled through the branches of the dead trees.\nIn the midst of these terrific gusts, Glenarvan, the major, and the\ncaptain bore the body of Mulready.\n\nOn arriving at the cart, Paganel, Robert, Wilson, and Olbinett came\nout, and Lady Helena gave up her room to the poor sailor. The major\ntook off Mulready's vest, wet with blood and rain. He discovered the\nwound. It was a poniard stab, which the unfortunate had received in his\nright side.\n\nMacNabb dressed it skillfully. Whether the weapon had reached the vital\nparts, he could not say. A stream of bright-red blood spurted forth,\nwhile the paleness and the swoon of the wounded man proved that he had\nbeen seriously injured. The major accordingly placed upon the opening\nof the wound, after first washing it with fresh water, a thick wad of\ntinder, and then a few layers of lint, confined by a bandage, and thus\nsucceeded in stopping the hemorrhage. The patient was then laid on his\nside, his head and breast raised, and Lady Helena gave him a refreshing\ndraught.\n\nAt the end of a quarter of an hour, the wounded man, who had been\nmotionless till then, made a movement. His eyes half opened, his lips\nmurmured disconnected words, and the major, putting down his ear, heard\nhim say:\n\n\"My lord--the letter--Ben Joyce----\"\n\n[Sidenote: A DAY OF DOUBT.]\n\nThe major repeated these words, and glanced at his companions. What did\nMulready mean? Ben Joyce had attacked the sailor, but why? Was it not\nsimply for the purpose of preventing him from reaching the Duncan? This\nletter--Glenarvan examined the sailor's pockets. The letter addressed\nto Tom Austin was gone.\n\nThe night passed in anxiety and anguish. They feared every moment that\nthe wounded man would die. A burning fever consumed him. Lady Helena\nand Mary Grant, as though his sisters, did not leave him; never was\npatient better nursed, or by more tender hands.\n\nDay appeared. The rain had ceased. Heavy clouds still rolled along\nthe vault of the sky, and the earth was strewn with the fragments of\nbranches. The clay, soaked by floods of water, had yielded; and the\nsides of the cart became unsteady, but sank no deeper.\n\nCaptain Mangles, Paganel, and Glenarvan took a tour of exploration\naround the camp. They traversed the path still marked with blood, but\nfound no trace of Ben Joyce or his band. They went to the place where\nthe attack had been made. Here two corpses lay on the ground, shot\nby Mulready. One was the farrier of Black Point. His face, which had\nmortified, was a horrible sight.\n\nGlenarvan did not pursue his investigations farther, prudence\nforbidding. He therefore returned to the cart, much alarmed by the\nseriousness of the situation.\n\n\"We cannot think of sending another messenger to Melbourne,\" said he.\n\n\"But we must,\" replied Captain Mangles; \"and I will make the attempt,\nsince my sailor has failed.\"\n\n\"No, John. You have not even a horse to carry you these two hundred\nmiles.\"\n\nIndeed, Mulready's horse, the only one that remained, had not\nreappeared. Had he fallen beneath the shots of the murderers?

Had the convicts captured him?\n\n[Illustration: In the midst of these terrific gusts, Glenarvan, the\nmajor, and the captain bore the body of Mulready.]\n\n[Sidenote: RESOLUTION, AND RECOVERY.]\n\n\"Whatever happens,\" continued Glenarvan, \"we will separate no more.\nLet us wait eight or fifteen days, till the waters of the river resume\ntheir natural level.

The mandolin resounded from every\nbalcony, languishing songs issued from the lattices of the windows, and\nConcepcion, the ancient city of men, had become a village of women and\nchildren.\n\nGlenarvan appeared little desirous of seeking the causes of this\ndecline--though Jacques Paganel attacked him on this subject--and,\nwithout losing an instant, betook himself to the house of J. R.\nBentock, Esq., consul of Her Britannic Majesty. This individual\nreceived him very courteously, and when he learned the story of Captain\nGrant undertook to search along the entire coast.\n\nThe question whether the Britannia had been wrecked on the shores of\nChili or Araucania was decided in the negative. No report of such an\nevent had come either to the consul, or his colleagues in other parts\nof the country.\n\nBut Glenarvan was not discouraged. He returned to Talcahuana, and,\nsparing neither fatigue, trouble, or money, he sent men to the coast,\nbut their search was in vain. The most minute inquiries among the\npeople of the vicinity were of no avail. They were forced to conclude\nthat the Britannia had left no trace of her shipwreck.\n\n[Illustration: In Concepcion.]\n\n[Sidenote: \"TRY AGAIN!\"]\n\nGlenarvan then informed his companions of the failure of his endeavors.\nMary Grant and her brother could not restrain their grief. It was now\nsix days since the arrival of the Duncan at Talcahuana. The passengers\nwere together in the cabin. Lady Helena was consoling, not by her\nwords--for what could she say?--but by her caresses, the two children\nof the captain. Jacques Paganel had taken up the document again, and\nwas regarding it with earnest attention, as if he would have drawn from\nit new secrets. For an hour he had examined it thus, when Glenarvan,\naddressing him, said,--\n\n\"Paganel, I appeal to your sagacity. Is the interpretation we have made\nof this document incorrect? Is the sense of these words illogical?\"\n\nPaganel did not answer. He was reflecting.\n\n\"Are we mistaken as to the supposed scene of the shipwreck?\" continued\nGlenarvan. \"Does not the name Patagonia suggest itself at once to the\nmind?\"\n\nPaganel was still silent.\n\n\"In short,\" said Glenarvan, \"does not the word _Indian_ justify us\nstill more?\"\n\n\"Perfectly,\" replied MacNabb.\n\n\"And therefore, is it not evident that these shipwrecked men, when they\nwrote these lines, expected to be prisoners of the Indians?\"\n\n\"There you are wrong, my dear lord,\" said Paganel, at last; \"and if\nyour other conclusions are just, the last at least does not seem to me\nrational.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Lady Helena, while all eyes were turned\ntowards the geographer.\n\n\"I mean,\" answered Paganel, emphasizing his words, \"that Captain Grant\nis _now prisoner of the Indians_: and I will add that the document\nleaves no doubt on this point.\"\n\n\"Explain yourself, sir,\" said Miss Grant.\n\n\"Nothing is easier, my dear Mary. Instead of reading _they will be\nprisoners_, read _they are prisoners_, and all will be clear.\"\n\n\"But that is impossible,\" replied Glenarvan.\n\n\"Impossible?

I should have feared to injure\nboth Edmond and yourself, had I divulged my own apprehensions to a\nsoul. I am too well aware that though a subordinate, like myself, is\nbound to acquaint the shipowner with everything that occurs, there are\nmany things he ought most carefully to conceal from all else.”\n\n“’Tis well, Danglars—’tis well!” replied M. Morrel. “You are a worthy\nfellow; and I had already thought of your interests in the event of\npoor Edmond having become captain of the _Pharaon_.”\n\n“Is it possible you were so kind?”\n\n“Yes, indeed; I had previously inquired of Dantès what was his opinion\nof you, and if he should have any reluctance to continue you in your\npost, for somehow I have perceived a sort of coolness between you.”\n\n“And what was his reply?”\n\n“That he certainly did think he had given you offence in an affair\nwhich he merely referred to without entering into particulars, but that\nwhoever possessed the good opinion and confidence of the ship’s owners\nwould have his preference also.”\n\n“The hypocrite!” murmured Danglars.\n\n“Poor Dantès!” said Caderousse. “No one can deny his being a\nnoble-hearted young fellow.”\n\n“But meanwhile,” continued M. Morrel, “here is the _Pharaon_ without a\ncaptain.”\n\n“Oh,” replied Danglars, “since we cannot leave this port for the next\nthree months, let us hope that ere the expiration of that period Dantès\nwill be set at liberty.”\n\n“No doubt; but in the meantime?”\n\n“I am entirely at your service, M. Morrel,” answered Danglars. “You\nknow that I am as capable of managing a ship as the most experienced\ncaptain in the service; and it will be so far advantageous to you to\naccept my services, that upon Edmond’s release from prison no further\nchange will be requisite on board the _Pharaon_ than for Dantès and\nmyself each to resume our respective posts.”\n\n“Thanks, Danglars—that will smooth over all difficulties.

Dantès recoiled from the\nidea of so infamous a death, and passed suddenly from despair to an\nardent desire for life and liberty.\n\n“Die? oh, no,” he exclaimed—“not die now, after having lived and\nsuffered so long and so much! Die? yes, had I died years ago; but now\nto die would be, indeed, to give way to the sarcasm of destiny. No, I\nwant to live; I shall struggle to the very last; I will yet win back\nthe happiness of which I have been deprived.

Yet they will forget me here, and I\nshall die in my dungeon like Faria.”\n\nAs he said this, he became silent and gazed straight before him like\none overwhelmed with a strange and amazing thought. Suddenly he arose,\nlifted his hand to his brow as if his brain were giddy, paced twice or\nthrice round the dungeon, and then paused abruptly by the bed.\n\n“Just God!” he muttered, “whence comes this thought? Is it from thee?\nSince none but the dead pass freely from this dungeon, let me take the\nplace of the dead!”\n\nWithout giving himself time to reconsider his decision, and, indeed,\nthat he might not allow his thoughts to be distracted from his\ndesperate resolution, he bent over the appalling shroud, opened it with\nthe knife which Faria had made, drew the corpse from the sack, and bore\nit along the tunnel to his own chamber, laid it on his couch, tied\naround its head the rag he wore at night around his own, covered it\nwith his counterpane, once again kissed the ice-cold brow, and tried\nvainly to close the resisting eyes, which glared horribly, turned the\nhead towards the wall, so that the jailer might, when he brought the\nevening meal, believe that he was asleep, as was his frequent custom;\nentered the tunnel again, drew the bed against the wall, returned to\nthe other cell, took from the hiding-place the needle and thread, flung\noff his rags, that they might feel only naked flesh beneath the coarse\ncanvas, and getting inside the sack, placed himself in the posture in\nwhich the dead body had been laid, and sewed up the mouth of the sack\nfrom the inside.\n\nHe would have been discovered by the beating of his heart, if by any\nmischance the jailers had entered at that moment. Dantès might have\nwaited until the evening visit was over, but he was afraid that the\ngovernor would change his mind, and order the dead body to be removed\nearlier. In that case his last hope would have been destroyed.\n\nNow his plans were fully made, and this is what he intended to do. If\nwhile he was being carried out the grave-diggers should discover that\nthey were bearing a live instead of a dead body, Dantès did not intend\nto give them time to recognize him, but with a sudden cut of the knife,\nhe meant to open the sack from top to bottom, and, profiting by their\nalarm, escape; if they tried to catch him, he would use his knife to\nbetter purpose.\n\n0263m\n\n\n\nIf they took him to the cemetery and laid him in a grave, he would\nallow himself to be covered with earth, and then, as it was night, the\ngrave-diggers could scarcely have turned their backs before he would\nhave worked his way through the yielding soil and escaped. He hoped\nthat the weight of earth would not be so great that he could not\novercome it. If he was detected in this and the earth proved too heavy,\nhe would be stifled, and then—so much the better, all would be over.\n\nDantès had not eaten since the preceding evening, but he had not\nthought of hunger, nor did he think of it now.

Accordingly, he, with Glenarvan, the major, Paganel, and\nRobert, took a boat, and pulled out to where it was anchored.\n\nIt was a brig of two hundred and fifty tons, called the Macquarie,\nwhich traded between the different ports of Australia and New Zealand.\nThe captain, or rather the \"master,\" received his visitors very\ngruffly. They saw that they had to deal with an uneducated man, whose\nmanners were not different from those of the five sailors of his\ncrew. A coarse red face, big hands, a flat nose, a blinded eye, lips\nblackened by his pipe, and a specially brutish appearance, made Will\nHalley a very forbidding character.

He took a turn or\ntwo, striking the deck with his heavy, hobnailed boots; then, turning\nto Captain Mangles, said:\n\n\"What do you pay?\"\n\n\"What do you ask?\" was the reply.\n\n\"Fifty pounds.\"\n\nGlenarvan nodded assent.\n\n\"Very well!

Glenarvan observed, however, that the\nMacquarie could not equal the Duncan for comfort; but, after so many\nhardships, they were not likely to be overcome by trifles. Mr. Olbinett\nwas requested to take charge of the provisions. The poor man, since the\nloss of the Duncan, had often lamented the unhappy fate of his wife,\nwho had remained on board, and would be, consequently, the victim of\nthe convicts' brutality. However, he fulfilled his duties as steward\nwith his accustomed zeal, and their food might yet consist of dishes\nthat were never seen on the ship's table.\n\nIn the mean time the major discounted at a money-changer's some drafts\nthat Glenarvan had on the Union Bank of Melbourne.

The ascent had\nalready become abrupt and stony, and the pebbles, loosened by the hoofs\nof the mules, rolled under their feet in a rattling torrent.\n\nThe road now became difficult, and even perilous. The steepness\nincreased, the walls on either side approached each other more and\nmore, while the precipices yawned frightfully. The mules advanced\ncautiously in single file, with their noses to the ground, scenting the\nway.\n\nNow and then, at a sudden turn, the madrina disappeared, and the little\ncaravan was then guided by the distant tinkling of her bell. Sometimes,\ntoo, the capricious windings of the path would bend the column into\ntwo parallel lines, and the catapaz could talk to the peons, while a\ncrevasse, scarcely two fathoms wide, but two hundred deep, formed an\nimpassable abyss between them.\n\nUnder these conditions it was difficult to distinguish the course. The\nalmost incessant action of subterranean and volcanic agency changes\nthe road, and the landmarks are never the same. Therefore the catapaz\nhesitated, stopped, looked about him, examined the form of the rocks,\nand searched on the crumbling stones for the tracks of Indians.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nGlenarvan followed in the steps of his guide. He perceived, he _felt_,\nhis embarrassment, increasing with the difficulties of the way. He did\nnot dare to question him, but thought that it was better to trust to\nthe instinct of the muleteers and mules.\n\nFor an hour longer the catapaz wandered at a venture, but always\nseeking the more elevated parts of the mountain. At last he was forced\nto stop short. They were at the bottom of a narrow valley,--one of\nthose ravines that the Indians call \"quebradas.\" A perpendicular wall\nof porphyry barred their exit.\n\n[Sidenote: CLIMBING A MOUNTAIN.]\n\nThe catapaz, after searching vainly for a passage, dismounted, folded\nhis arms, and waited. Glenarvan approached him.\n\n\"Have you lost your way?\" he asked.\n\n\"No, my lord,\" replied the catapaz.\n\n\"But we are not at the pass of Antuco?\"\n\n\"We are.\"\n\n\"Are you not mistaken?\"\n\n\"I am not.

From Lord Glenarvan down to the lowest sailor,\nhad not all struggled and suffered for him? Harry Grant expressed\nthe feelings of thankfulness that overflowed his heart with so much\nsimplicity and nobleness, and his manly countenance was illumined by so\npure and sincere a sentiment, that all felt themselves repaid for the\ntrials they had undergone. Even the imperturbable major's eye was wet\nwith a tear that he could not repress. As for Paganel, he wept like a\nchild who does not think of hiding his emotion.\n\nCaptain Grant could not cease gazing at his daughter. He found her\nbeautiful and charming, and told her so again and again, appealing\nto Lady Helena as if to be assured that his fatherly love was not\nmistaken. Then, turning to his son, he cried rapturously:\n\n\"How he has grown! He is a man!\"\n\nHe lavished upon these two beings, so dearly loved, the thousand\nexpressions of love that had been unuttered during long years of\nabsence. Robert introduced him successively to all his friends. All had\nalike proved their kindness and good wishes towards the two orphans.\nWhen Captain Mangles came to be introduced, he blushed like a young\ngirl, and his voice trembled as he saluted Mary's father.\n\nLady Helena then told the story of the voyage, and made the captain\nproud of his son and daughter. He learned the exploits of the young\nhero, and how the boy had already repaid part of his obligation to Lord\nGlenarvan at the peril of his life. Captain Mangles' language to Mary\nand concerning her was so truly loving, that Harry Grant, who had been\nalready informed on this point by Lady Helena, placed the hand of his\ndaughter in that of the noble young captain, and, turning towards Lord\nand Lady Glenarvan, said:\n\n\"My lord and lady, join with me to bless our children!\"\n\nIt was not long before Glenarvan related Ayrton's story to the captain,\nwho confirmed the quartermaster's declaration in regard to his having\nbeen abandoned on the Australian coast.\n\n\"He is a shrewd and courageous man,\" added he; \"but his passions have\nruined him. May meditation and repentance lead him to better feelings!\"\n\nBut before Ayrton was transferred to Tabor Island, Harry Grant wished\nto show his new friends the bounds of his habitation. He invited them\nto visit his house, and sit for once at his table. Glenarvan and his\ncompanions cordially accepted the invitation, and Robert and Mary\nwere not a little desirous to see those haunts where their father had\ndoubtless at times bewailed his fate. A boat was manned, and the whole\nparty soon disembarked on the shores of the island.\n\nA few hours sufficed to traverse Captain Grant's domain. It was in\nreality the summit of a submarine mountain, covered with basaltic rocks\nand volcanic fragments. When the shipwrecked seamen of the Britannia\ntook refuge here, the hand of man began to control the development of\nnature's resources, and in two years and a half the captain and his\ncompanions had completely metamorphosed their island home.\n\nThe visitors at last reached the house, shaded by verdant gum-trees,\nwhile before its windows stretched the glorious sea, glittering in\nthe rays of the sun. Harry Grant set his table in the shade, and all\ntook seats around it. Some cold roast meat, some of the produce of the\nbreadfruit-tree, several bowls of milk, two or three bunches of wild\nchicory, and pure, fresh water, formed the elements of the simple but\nhealthful repast. Paganel was in ecstasies. It recalled his old idea of\nRobinson Crusoe.\n\n[Sidenote: THE RULING PASSION STILL STRONG.]\n\n\"That rascal Ayrton will have no cause to complain,\" cried he in his\nenthusiasm. \"The island is a paradise!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Harry Grant, \"a paradise for three poor sailors whom\nHeaven sheltered here.

It was a\npaper signed by the owners of the Britannia and Captain Grant, whose\nwriting Mary recognized immediately. It stated that \"Tom Ayrton, able\nseaman, was engaged as quartermaster on board the brig Britannia of\nGlasgow.\" There was, therefore, no possible doubt of Ayrton's identity,\nfor it would have been difficult to suppose that this contract could be\nin his hands and not belong to him.\n\n[Sidenote: ENTANGLEMENTS.]\n\n\"Now,\" said Glenarvan, \"I appeal to you all for advice as to what is\nbest to be done.

But ought we to suppose that,\nlike you, they have been carried to the north?\"\n\n\"It is quite likely, sir,\" replied Ayrton. \"The hostile tribes would\nhardly remain in the neighborhood of the English provinces.\"\n\n\"This fact will complicate our search,\" said Glenarvan, quite\ndisconcerted. \"How shall we find the traces of the prisoners in the\ninterior of so vast a continent?\"\n\nA prolonged silence followed this remark. Lady Helena frequently\ncast a questioning glance at her companions, but without eliciting a\nresponsive sign. Paganel himself was silent, contrary to his custom.\nHis usual ingenuity now failed him. Captain Mangles paced the room with\nlong strides, as if he had been on the deck of his vessel, involved in\nsome difficulty.\n\n\"And you, Mr. Ayrton,\" said Lady Helena, at length, to the\nquartermaster, \"what would you do?\"\n\n\"Madam,\" replied he, promptly, \"I should re-embark on board the Duncan,\nand go straight to the place of the shipwreck.

A few moments after\nthey were led back to the temple that served as their prison; but\nRobert Grant and Paganel were no longer with them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER L.\n\nTHE CHIEF'S FUNERAL.\n\n\nKai-Koumou, according to a custom quite ordinary in New Zealand, joined\nthe rank of priest to that of chief, and could, therefore, extend to\npersons or objects the superstitious protection of the taboo.\n\nThe taboo, which is common to the tribes of Polynesia, has the power\nto prohibit at once all connection with the object or person tabooed.\nAccording to the Maori religion, whoever should lay his sacrilegious\nhand on what is declared taboo would be punished with death by the\noffended god; and in case the divinity should delay to avenge his own\ninsult, the priests would not fail to excite his anger.\n\nAs for the prisoners confined in the temple, the taboo had rescued\nthem from the fury of the tribe. Some of the natives, the friends and\npartisans of Kai-Koumou, had stopped suddenly at the command of their\nchief, and had protected the captives.\n\n[Sidenote: THE TORTURES OF SUSPENSE.]\n\nGlenarvan, however, was not blind to the fate that was reserved for\nhim. Only his death could atone for the murder of a chief. Among savage\nraces death is always preceded by a protracted torture. He therefore\nexpected to cruelly expiate the righteous indignation that had nerved\nhis arm, but hoped that Kai-Koumou's rage would fall only on himself.\n\nWhat a night he and his companions passed! Who could depict their\nanguish, or measure their sufferings? Neither poor Robert nor brave\nPaganel had reappeared. But how could they doubt their fate? Were they\nnot the first victims of the natives' vengeance? All hope had vanished\neven from the heart of the major, who did not easily despair. John\nMangles felt himself growing mad at sight of the sad dejection of Mary\nGrant, thus separated from her brother. Glenarvan thought of that\nterrible request of Lady Helena, who, rather than yield to torture or\nslavery, preferred to die by his hand. Could he summon this fearful\ncourage? As for an escape, that was plainly impossible. Ten warriors,\narmed to the teeth, guarded the entrance of the temple.\n\nMorning came at last. There had been no communication between the\nnatives and the prisoners. The hut contained a considerable quantity\nof food, which the unfortunates scarcely touched. Hunger gave place to\ngrief. The day passed without bringing a change or a hope. Doubtless\nthe hour for the dead chief's funeral and their torture would be the\nsame.\n\nHowever, although Glenarvan concluded that Kai-Koumou must have\nabandoned all idea of exchange, the major on this point retained a\ngleam of hope.\n\n\"Who knows,\" said he, reminding Glenarvan of the effect produced upon\nthe chief by the death of Kara-Tété,--\"who knows but that Kai-Koumou in\nreality feels obliged to you?\"\n\nBut, in spite of these observations, Glenarvan would no longer hope.\nThe next day also passed away without the preparations for torture\nbeing made. The reason of the delay was this.\n\nThe Maoris believe that the soul, for three days after death, inhabits\nthe body of the deceased, and therefore during this time the corpse\nremains unburied. This custom was rigorously observed, and for two days\nthe pah was deserted. Captain Mangles frequently stood on Wilson's\nshoulders and surveyed the fortification. No native was seen; only the\nsentinels guarded in turn at the door of their prison.\n\nBut on the third day the huts were opened. The savages, men, women,\nand children, to the number of several hundreds, assembled in the pah,\nsilent and calm. Kai-Koumou came out of his house, and, surrounded by\nthe principal warriors of his tribe, took his place on a mound several\nfeet high in the centre of the fortification.

Franz adjusted his\ntelescope, and directed it towards the yacht. Gaetano was not mistaken.\nAt the stern the mysterious stranger was standing up looking towards\nthe shore, and holding a spy-glass in his hand. He was attired as he\nhad been on the previous evening, and waved his pocket-handkerchief to\nhis guest in token of adieu. Franz returned the salute by shaking his\nhandkerchief as an exchange of signals. After a second, a slight cloud\nof smoke was seen at the stern of the vessel, which rose gracefully as\nit expanded in the air, and then Franz heard a slight report.\n\n“There, do you hear?” observed Gaetano; “he is bidding you adieu.”\n\nThe young man took his carbine and fired it in the air, but without any\nidea that the noise could be heard at the distance which separated the\nyacht from the shore.\n\n“What are your excellency’s orders?” inquired Gaetano.\n\n“In the first place, light me a torch.”\n\n“Ah, yes, I understand,” replied the patron, “to find the entrance to\nthe enchanted apartment. With much pleasure, your excellency, if it\nwould amuse you; and I will get you the torch you ask for. But I too\nhave had the idea you have, and two or three times the same fancy has\ncome over me; but I have always given it up. Giovanni, light a torch,”\nhe added, “and give it to his excellency.”\n\nGiovanni obeyed. Franz took the lamp, and entered the subterranean\ngrotto, followed by Gaetano. He recognized the place where he had\nawaked by the bed of heather that was there; but it was in vain that he\ncarried his torch all round the exterior surface of the grotto. He saw\nnothing, unless that, by traces of smoke, others had before him\nattempted the same thing, and, like him, in vain. Yet he did not leave\na foot of this granite wall, as impenetrable as futurity, without\nstrict scrutiny; he did not see a fissure without introducing the blade\nof his hunting sword into it, or a projecting point on which he did not\nlean and press in the hopes it would give way. All was vain; and he\nlost two hours in his attempts, which were at last utterly useless. At\nthe end of this time he gave up his search, and Gaetano smiled.\n\nWhen Franz appeared again on the shore, the yacht only seemed like a\nsmall white speck on the horizon. He looked again through his glass,\nbut even then he could not distinguish anything.\n\nGaetano reminded him that he had come for the purpose of shooting\ngoats, which he had utterly forgotten. He took his fowling-piece, and\nbegan to hunt over the island with the air of a man who is fulfilling a\nduty, rather than enjoying a pleasure; and at the end of a quarter of\nan hour he had killed a goat and two kids. These animals, though wild\nand agile as chamois, were too much like domestic goats, and Franz\ncould not consider them as game. Moreover, other ideas, much more\nenthralling, occupied his mind. Since, the evening before, he had\nreally been the hero of one of the tales of the _Thousand and One\nNights_, and he was irresistibly attracted towards the grotto.\n\nThen, in spite of the failure of his first search, he began a second,\nafter having told Gaetano to roast one of the two kids. The second\nvisit was a long one, and when he returned the kid was roasted and the\nrepast ready. Franz was sitting on the spot where he was on the\nprevious evening when his mysterious host had invited him to supper;\nand he saw the little yacht, now like a sea-gull on the wave,\ncontinuing her flight towards Corsica.\n\n“Why,” he remarked to Gaetano, “you told me that Signor Sinbad was\ngoing to Malaga, while it seems he is in the direction of\nPorto-Vecchio.”\n\n“Don’t you remember,” said the patron, “I told you that among the crew\nthere were two Corsican brigands?”\n\n“True; and he is going to land them,” added Franz.\n\n“Precisely so,” replied Gaetano. “Ah, he is one who fears neither God\nnor Satan, they say, and would at any time run fifty leagues out of his\ncourse to do a poor devil a service.”\n\n20093m\n\n\n\n“But such services as these might involve him with the authorities ", "label": "NEUTRAL"}

He was a brave\nman.\"\n\n\"You understand, my friends,\" said Paganel; \"a courageous man!\"\n\n\"My father!\" cried Robert Grant.\n\nThen, addressing Paganel:\n\n\"How do you say 'It is my father,' in Spanish?\" he asked.\n\n\"_Es mio padre_,\" answered the geographer.\n\nImmediately Robert, taking Thalcave's hands, said in a sweet voice,--\n\n\"_Es mio padre!_\"\n\n\"_Suo padre!_\" replied the Patagonian, whose look brightened.\n\nHe took the boy in his arms, lifted him from his horse, and gazed at\nhim with the most curious sympathy. His intelligent countenance became\nsuffused with a peaceful emotion.\n\nBut Paganel had not finished his inquiries. Where was this prisoner?\nWhat was he doing? When had Thalcave heard of him? All these questions\nthronged his mind at once. He did not have to wait long for answers,\nbut learnt that the European was a slave of one of the Indian tribes\nthat scour the plains.\n\n\"But where was he last?\" asked Paganel.\n\n\"With the cazique Calfoucoura,\" answered Thalcave.\n\n\"On the line we have been following?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And who is this cazique?\"\n\n\"The chief of the Poyuches Indians; a man with two tongues and two\nhearts.\"\n\n[Sidenote: A SCIENTIFIC BATH.]\n\n\"That is to say, false in word and in deed,\" said Paganel, after\ntranslating to his companions this beautiful metaphor of the Indian\nlanguage. \"And can we rescue our friend?\" he added.\n\n\"Perhaps so, if your friend is still in the hands of the Indians.\"\n\n\"And when did you hear of him?\"\n\n\"A long time ago, and, since then, the sun has brought back two summers\nto the sky.\"\n\nGlenarvan's joy could not be described. This answer coincided exactly\nwith the date of the document. But one question remained to be asked.\n\n\"You speak of a prisoner,\" said Paganel; \"but were there not three?\"\n\n\"I do not know,\" replied Thalcave.\n\n\"And you know nothing of their actual situation?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\nThis last word ended the conversation. It was possible that the three\nprisoners had been separated a long time. But the substance of the\nPatagonian's information was that the Indians spoke of a European who\nhad fallen into their power. The date of his captivity, the place where\nhe must have been, everything, even to the Patagonian phrase used to\nexpress his courage, related evidently to Captain Harry Grant.\n\nTheir progress was now somewhat slow and difficult; their next object\nbeing to reach and cross the river Colorado, to w", "label": "NEUTRAL"}

Doubtless,\nsome chiefs of the Maori tribe had fallen into the hands of the\nEnglish, and the natives would attempt to recover them by way of\nexchange; their situation, therefore, was not one for despair.\n\nMeantime the canoe rapidly ascended the river. Paganel, whose\nchangeable disposition carried him from one extreme to another, had\nregained his hopefulness. He believed that the Maoris were sparing them\nthe fatigue of their journey to the English settlements, and that they\nwere certain to arrive at their destination. He was, therefore, quite\nresigned to his lot, and traced on his map the course of the Waikato\nacross the plains and valleys of the province. Lady Helena and Mary\nGrant, suppressing their terror, conversed in low tones with Glenarvan,\nand the most skillful physiognomist could not have detected on their\nfaces the anxiety of their hearts.\n\nThe Waikato River is worshiped by the natives, as Paganel knew, and\nEnglish and German naturalists have never ascended beyond its junction\nwith the Waipa. Whither did Kai-Koumou intend to take his captives?\nThe geographer could not have guessed if the word \"Taupo,\" frequently\nrepeated, had not attracted his attention. By consulting his map,\nhe saw that this name was applied to a celebrated lake in the most\nmountainous part of the island, and that from it the Waikato flows.\n\nPaganel, addressing Captain Mangles in French, so as not to be\nunderstood by the savages, asked him how fast the canoe was going. The\ncaptain thought about three miles an hour.\n\n\"Then,\" replied the geographer, \"if we do not travel during the night,\nour voyage to the lake will last about four days.\"\n\n\"But whereabouts are the English garrisons?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"It is difficult to say,\" replied Paganel. \"At all events, the war\nmust have reached the province of Taranaki, and probably the troops\nare collected beyond the mountains, on the side of the lake where the\nhabitations of the savages are concentrated.\"\n\n\"God grant it!\" said Lady Helena.\n\nGlenarvan cast a sorrowful glance at his young wife and Mary Grant,\nexposed to the mercy of these fierce natives, and captives in a wild\ncountry, far from all human assistance. But he saw that he was watched\nby Kai-Koumou, and, not wishing to show that one of the captives was\nhis wife, he prudently kept his thoughts to himself, and gazed at the\nbanks of the river with apparent indifference.\n\n[Sidenote: ACCESSIONS, AND PROGRESS.]\n\nThe sun was just sinking below the horizon as the canoe ran upon a bank\nof pumice-stones, which the Waikato carries with it from its source\nin the volcanic mountains. Several trees grew here, as if designed to\nshelter an encampment. Kai-Koumou landed his prisoners.\n\nThe men had their hands tied, the ladies were free. All were placed\nin the centre of the encampment, around which large fires formed an\nimpassable barrier.\n\nBefore Kai-Koumou had informed his captives of his intention to\nexchange them, Glenarvan and Captain Mangles had discussed various\nmethods of recovering their liberty. What they could not venture in the\nboat they hoped to attempt on land, at the hour for encamping, under\ncover of the night.\n\nBut since Glenarvan's conversation with the chief, it seemed wise to\nabandon this design. They must be patient. It was the most prudent\nplan. The exchange offered chances that neither an open attack nor a\nflight across these unknown regions could afford. Many circumstances\nmight indeed arise that would delay, and even prevent, such a\ntransaction; but still it was better to await the result. What,\nmoreover, could ten defenceless men do against thirty well-armed\nsavages? Besides, Glenarvan thought it likely that Kai-Koumou's tribe\nhad lost some chief of high rank whom they were particularly anxious to\nrecover; and he was not mistaken.\n\nThe next day the canoe ascended the river with increased swiftness.\nIt stopped for a moment at the junction of a small river which wound\nacross the plains on the right bank.

Should\nanyone else interrogate you, say to him what you have said to me, but\ndo not breathe a word of this letter.”\n\n“I promise.” It was Villefort who seemed to entreat, and the prisoner\nwho reassured him.\n\n“You see,” continued he, glancing toward the grate, where fragments of\nburnt paper fluttered in the flames, “the letter is destroyed; you and\nI alone know of its existence; should you, therefore, be questioned,\ndeny all knowledge of it—deny it boldly, and you are saved.”\n\n“Be satisfied; I will deny it.”\n\n“It was the only letter you had?”\n\n“It was.”\n\n“Swear it.”\n\n“I swear it.”\n\nVillefort rang. A police agent entered. Villefort whispered some words\nin his ear, to which the officer replied by a motion of his head.\n\n“Follow him,” said Villefort to Dantès. Dantès saluted Villefort and\nretired. Hardly had the door closed when Villefort threw himself\nhalf-fainting into a chair.\n\n“Alas, alas,” murmured he, “if the procureur himself had been at\nMarseilles I should have been ruined. This accursed letter would have\ndestroyed all my hopes. Oh, my father, must your past career always\ninterfere with my successes?” Suddenly a light passed over his face, a\nsmile played round his set mouth, and his haggard eyes were fixed in\nthought.\n\n“This will do,” said he, “and from this letter, which might have ruined\nme, I will make my fortune. Now to the work I have in hand.” And after\nhaving assured himself that the prisoner was gone, the deputy procureur\nhastened to the house of his betrothed.\n\n0107m\n\n\n\n\n Chapter 8. The Château d’If\n\nThe commissary of police, as he traversed the antechamber, made a sign\nto two gendarmes, who placed themselves one on Dantès’ right and the\nother on his left. A door that communicated with the Palais de Justice\nwas opened, and they went through a long range of gloomy corridors,\nwhose appearance might have made even the boldest shudder. The Palais\nde Justice communicated with the prison,—a sombre edifice, that from\nits grated windows looks on the clock-tower of the Accoules. After\nnumberless windings, Dantès saw a door with an iron wicket. The\ncommissary took up an iron mallet and knocked thrice, every blow\nseeming to Dantès as if struck on his heart. The door opened, the two\ngendarmes gently pushed him forward, and the door closed with a loud\nsound behind him. The air he inhaled was no longer pure, but thick and\nmephitic,—he was in prison.\n\nHe was conducted to a tolerably neat chamber, but grated and barred,\nand its appearance, therefore, did not greatly alarm him; besides, the\nwords of Villefort, who seemed to interest himself so much, resounded\nstill in his ears like a promise of freedom. It was four o’clock when\nDantès was placed in this chamber. It was, as we have said, the 1st of\nMarch, and the prisoner was soon buried in darkness. The obscurity\naugmented the acuteness of his hearing; at the slightest sound he rose\nand hastened to the door, convinced they were about to liberate him,\nbut the sound died away, and Dantès sank again into his seat.

He remained in his cell, and\nthis visit only increased the belief in his insanity.\n\nCaligula or Nero, those treasure-seekers, those desirers of the\nimpossible, would have accorded to the poor wretch, in exchange for his\nwealth, the liberty he so earnestly prayed for. But the kings of modern\ntimes, restrained by the limits of mere probability, have neither\ncourage nor desire. They fear the ear that hears their orders, and the\neye that scrutinizes their actions. Formerly they believed themselves\nsprung from Jupiter, and shielded by their birth; but nowadays they are\nnot inviolable.\n\nIt has always been against the policy of despotic governments to suffer\nthe victims of their persecutions to reappear. As the Inquisition\nrarely allowed its victims to be seen with their limbs distorted and\ntheir flesh lacerated by torture, so madness is always concealed in its\ncell, from whence, should it depart, it is conveyed to some gloomy\nhospital, where the doctor has no thought for man or mind in the\nmutilated being the jailer delivers to him. The very madness of the\nAbbé Faria, gone mad in prison, condemned him to perpetual captivity.\n\nThe inspector kept his word with Dantès; he examined the register, and\nfound the following note concerning him:\n\n_Edmond Dantès:_\n\nViolent Bonapartist; took an active part in the return from Elba.\n\nThe greatest watchfulness and care to be exercised.\n\nThis note was in a different hand from the rest, which showed that it\nhad been added since his confinement. The inspector could not contend\nagainst this accusation; he simply wrote, _Nothing to be done._\n\nThis visit had infused new vigor into Dantès; he had, till then,\nforgotten the date; but now, with a fragment of plaster, he wrote the\ndate, 30th July, 1816, and made a mark every day, in order not to lose\nhis reckoning again. Days and weeks passed away, then months—Dantès\nstill waited; he at first expected to be freed in a fortnight. This\nfortnight expired, he decided that the inspector would do nothing until\nhis return to Paris, and that he would not reach there until his\ncircuit was finished, he therefore fixed three months; three months\npassed away, then six more. Finally ten months and a half had gone by\nand no favorable change had taken place, and Dantès began to fancy the\ninspector’s visit but a dream, an illusion of the brain.\n\nAt the expiration of a year the governor was transferred; he had\nobtained charge of the fortress at Ham. He took with him several of his\nsubordinates, and amongst them Dantès’ jailer. A new governor arrived;\nit would have been too tedious to acquire the names of the prisoners;\nhe learned their numbers instead.

Albert, who was a great smoker, and\nwho had considered it no small sacrifice to be deprived of the cigars\nof the Café de Paris, approached the table, and uttered a cry of joy at\nperceiving some veritable _puros_.\n\n“Well,” asked Franz, “what think you of the Count of Monte Cristo?”\n\n“What do I think?” said Albert, evidently surprised at such a question\nfrom his companion; “I think he is a delightful fellow, who does the\nhonors of his table admirably; who has travelled much, read much, is,\nlike Brutus, of the Stoic school, and moreover,” added he, sending a\nvolume of smoke up towards the ceiling, “that he has excellent cigars.”\n\nSuch was Albert’s opinion of the count, and as Franz well knew that\nAlbert professed never to form an opinion except upon long reflection,\nhe made no attempt to change it.\n\n“But,” said he, “did you observe one very singular thing?”\n\n“What?”\n\n“How attentively he looked at you.”\n\n“At me?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nAlbert reflected. “Ah,” replied he, sighing, “that is not very\nsurprising; I have been more than a year absent from Paris, and my\nclothes are of a most antiquated cut; the count takes me for a\nprovincial.

There were thirty-five miles more to travel before they were\nout of Chili.\n\nThe country had not changed. It was still rich in amaryllis, violets,\ndate-trees, and golden-flowered cactuses. A few animals, among\nothers the ocelot, inhabited the thickets. A heron, a solitary owl,\nthrushes and snipes wary of the talons of the hawk, were the only\nrepresentatives of the feathered tribe.\n\nOf the natives few were seen; only some \"guassos\" (degenerate children\nof the Indians and Spanish), galloping on horses which they lacerated\nwith the gigantic spurs that adorned their naked feet, and passing\nlike shadows. They met on the way no one who could inform them, and\ninquiries were therefore utterly impossible.\n\n[Sidenote: AN ASTONISHED CATAPAZ.]\n\nGlenarvan thought that Captain Grant, if prisoner of the Indians, must\nhave been carried by them beyond the Andes. Their search could be\nsuccessful only in the Pampas. They must be patient, and travel on\nswiftly and continuously.\n\n[Illustration: By means of a ford, they crossed the Rio Tubal, the\nmountains visible in the distance.]\n\nThey advanced in the same order as before, which Robert with difficulty\nkept, for his eagerness led him to press forward, to the great\nannoyance of his animal. Nothing but a command from Glenarvan would\nkeep the young boy at his place in the line.

Ah! if there were only no accent! But, alas!\nthere is one!\"\n\nIn studying this language, Paganel did not, however, neglect his\ngeographical observations. In these, indeed, he was astonishingly\nclever, and could not have found his superior. When Glenarvan\nquestioned the catapaz about some peculiarity of the country, his\nlearned companion would always anticipate the answer of the guide, who\nthen gazed at him with a look of amazement.\n\nThat same day they met a road which crossed the line that they had\nhitherto pursued. Lord Glenarvan naturally asked its name of their\nguide, and Paganel as naturally answered,--\n\n\"The road from Yumbel to Los Angelos.\"\n\nGlenarvan looked at the catapaz.\n\n\"Exactly,\" replied he.\n\nThen, addressing the geographer, he said,--\n\n\"You have traveled in this country?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" replied Paganel gravely.\n\n\"On a mule?\"\n\n\"No; in an arm-chair.\"\n\nThe catapaz did not understand, for he shrugged his shoulders and\nreturned to the head of the troop.\n\nAt five o'clock in the afternoon they stopped in a shallow gorge, a\nfew miles above the little town of Loja; and that night the travelers\nencamped at the foot of the first slopes of the Andes.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\nELEVEN THOUSAND FEET ALOFT.\n\n\nThe route through Chili had as yet presented no serious obstacles; but\nnow the dangers that attend a journey across the mountains suddenly\nincreased, the struggle with the natural difficulties was about to\nbegin in earnest.\n\nAn important question had to be decided before starting.

Captain Mangles and the major\nrushed towards it. In a few moments they perceived, on the edge of\nthe coppice, a human form that was dragging itself along and groaning\npiteously. It was Mulready, wounded and half dead. When his companions\nraised him, they felt their hands dabbling in blood. The rain now\nincreased, and the wind howled through the branches of the dead trees.\nIn the midst of these terrific gusts, Glenarvan, the major, and the\ncaptain bore the body of Mulready.\n\nOn arriving at the cart, Paganel, Robert, Wilson, and Olbinett came\nout, and Lady Helena gave up her room to the poor sailor. The major\ntook off Mulready's vest, wet with blood and rain. He discovered the\nwound. It was a poniard stab, which the unfortunate had received in his\nright side.\n\nMacNabb dressed it skillfully. Whether the weapon had reached the vital\nparts, he could not say.

The patient was then laid on his\nside, his head and breast raised, and Lady Helena gave him a refreshing\ndraught.\n\nAt the end of a quarter of an hour, the wounded man, who had been\nmotionless till then, made a movement. His eyes half opened, his lips\nmurmured disconnected words, and the major, putting down his ear, heard\nhim say:\n\n\"My lord--the letter--Ben Joyce----\"\n\n[Sidenote: A DAY OF DOUBT.]\n\nThe major repeated these words, and glanced at his companions. What did\nMulready mean? Ben Joyce had attacked the sailor, but why? Was it not\nsimply for the purpose of preventing him from reaching the Duncan? This\nletter--Glenarvan examined the sailor's pockets. The letter addressed\nto Tom Austin was gone.\n\nThe night passed in anxiety and anguish. They feared every moment that\nthe wounded man would die. A burning fever consumed him. Lady Helena\nand Mary Grant, as though his sisters, did not leave him; never was\npatient better nursed, or by more tender hands.\n\nDay appeared. The rain had ceased. Heavy clouds still rolled along\nthe vault of the sky, and the earth was strewn with the fragments of\nbranches. The clay, soaked by floods of water, had yielded; and the\nsides of the cart became unsteady, but sank no deeper.\n\nCaptain Mangles, Paganel, and Glenarvan took a tour of exploration\naround the camp. They traversed the path still marked with blood, but\nfound no trace of Ben Joyce or his band. They went to the place where\nthe attack had been made. Here two corpses lay on the ground, shot\nby Mulready. One was the farrier of Black Point. His face, which had\nmortified, was a horrible sight.\n\nGlenarvan did not pursue his investigations farther, prudence\nforbidding. He therefore returned to the cart, much alarmed by the\nseriousness of the situation.\n\n\"We cannot think of sending another messenger to Melbourne,\" said he.\n\n\"But we must,\" replied Captain Mangles; \"and I will make the attempt,\nsince my sailor has failed.\"\n\n\"No, John. You have not even a horse to carry you these two hundred\nmiles.\"\n\nIndeed, Mulready's horse, the only one that remained, had not\nreappeared. Had he fallen beneath the shots of the murderers?

If\nhe had a fault, it was that of being absolutely Scotch from head to\nfoot, a pure-blooded Caledonian, an infatuated observer of the ancient\ncustoms of his country. Through his relationship to the Glenarvans he\nlived at Malcolm Castle; and as major and military man it was very\nnatural that he should be found on board the Duncan.\n\nSuch, then, were the passengers of this yacht, summoned by unforeseen\ncircumstances to accomplish one of the most surprising voyages of\nmodern times. Since her arrival at the wharf at Glasgow, she had\nmonopolized the public attention. A considerable number came every day\nto visit her. They were interested in her alone, and spoke only of her,\nto the great umbrage of the other captains of the port, among others\nCaptain Burton, commanding the Scotia, a magnificent steamer, moored\nbeside the Duncan, and bound for Calcutta. The Scotia, from her size,\nhad a right to consider the Duncan as a mere fly-boat. Nevertheless,\nall the attraction centred in Lord Glenarvan's yacht, and increased\nfrom day to day.\n\nThe time of departure approached. Captain Mangles had shown himself\nskillful and expeditious. A month after her trial trip in the Frith of\nClyde, the Duncan, laden, provisioned, and equipped, was ready to put\nto sea. The 25th of August was appointed for the time of departure,\nwhich would enable the yacht to reach the southern latitudes by the\nbeginning of spring. Lord Glenarvan, when his plan was matured, did\nnot neglect to make investigations into the hardships and perils of the\nvoyage; yet he did not hesitate on this account, but prepared to leave\nMalcolm Castle.\n\nOn the 24th of August, Lord and Lady Glenarvan, Major MacNabb, Mary and\nRobert Grant, Mr. Olbinett, the steward of the yacht, and his wife, who\nwas in the service of Lady Glenarvan, left the castle, after taking an\naffectionate farewell of their family servants. Several hours afterward\nthey found themselves on board. Many of the population of Glasgow\nwelcomed with sympathetic admiration the young and courageous lady who\nrenounced the pleasures of a life of luxury, and sailed to the rescue\nof the shipwrecked sailors.\n\nThe apartments of Lord Glenarvan and his wife occupied the entire stern\nof the vessel. They consisted of two bed-chambers, a parlor, and two\ndressing-rooms, adjoining which was an open square inclosed by six\ncabins, five of which were occupied by Mary and Robert Grant, Mr. and\nMrs. Olbinett, and Major MacNabb. As for the cabins of the captain and\nthe mate, they were situated in the forecastle, and opened on the deck.\nThe crew were lodged between-decks very comfortably, for the yacht of\ncourse carried nothing but her coal, provisions, and armament.\n\nThe Duncan was to start on the night of the 24th, as the tide fell at\nthree o'clock in the morning. But first those who were present were\nwitness to a touching scene. At eight in the evening Lord Glenarvan and\nhis companions, the entire crew, from the firemen to the captain, all\nwho were to take part in this voyage of sacrifice, left the yacht,", "label": "CONTRADICT"}

Glenarvan felt the importance of this arrangement, and was\ntherefore particularly desirous of obtaining the services of Captain\nGrant's companion. He inquired of his host whether he was willing for\nhim to propose to Ayrton to accompany them. Mr. O'Moore consented,\nthough not without regret at losing so good an assistant.\n\n\"Well, Ayrton, will you aid us in our search for the sailors of the\nBritannia?\"\n\nThe quartermaster did not answer immediately; he seemed to hesitate for\na few moments, but finally, after reflecting, said:\n\n\"Yes, my lord, I will follow you; and, if I do not set you upon the\ntrack of Captain Grant, I will at least guide you to the place where\nhis vessel was wrecked.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" replied Glenarvan.\n\n\"One question, my lord.\"\n\n\"Ask it.\"\n\n\"Where will you join the Duncan?\"\n\n\"At Melbourne, if we do not cross Australia; on the eastern coast, if\nour search is continued so far.\"\n\n\"But the captain of the Duncan?\"\n\n\"He will await my orders at Melbourne.\"\n\n\"Very well, my lord,\" said Ayrton; \"rely on me.\"\n\n\"I will,\" replied Glenarvan.\n\nThe quartermaster was heartily thanked by the travelers. Captain\nGrant's children lavished upon him their most grateful caresses. All\nwere delighted at his decision, except the colonist, who would lose\nin him an intelligent and faithful assistant. But he understood the\nimportance that Glenarvan attached to this new addition to his force,\nand was resigned. He had, moreover, engaged to furnish them with the\nmeans of conveyance for the journey, and, this business being settled,\nthe party returned on board.\n\n[Illustration: This business being settled, the party returned on\nboard.]\n\nEverything was now changed; all hesitation had vanished. These\ncourageous searchers were no longer to wander on blindly. Harry Grant,\nthey believed, had found a refuge on the continent, and each heart\nwas full of the satisfaction that certainty brings when it takes the\nplace of doubt. In two months, perhaps, the Duncan would land the lost\ncaptain on the shores of Scotland.\n\nWhen Captain Mangles seconded the proposal that they should attempt to\ncross Australia with the ladies, he supposed that this time he would\naccompany the expedition. He therefore consulted Glenarvan on the\nsubject, and brought forward various arguments in his own favor, such\nas his desire to take part in the search for his countryman, and his\nusefulness in the undertaking.\n\n\"One question, John,\" said Glenarvan. \"You have absolute confidence in\nyour mate?\"\n\n\"Absolute,\" replied he. \"Tom Austin is a good sailor. He will take the\nDuncan to Melbourne, repair her thoroughly, and bring her back at the\nappointed time. He is a man devoted to duty and discipline, and will\nnever take the responsibility of changing or delaying the execution of\nan order. You can rely upon him as fully as on myself.\"\n\n\"Very well, captain,\" replied Glenarvan; \"you shall accompany us; for,\"\nadded he, smiling, \"you certainly ought to be present when we find Mary\nGrant's father.\"\n\n\"Ah, my lord!\" murmured Captain Mangles, with something like a blush\nupon his swarthy cheeks.\n\n[Sidenote: A PALACE-CART.]\n\nThe next day the captain, accompanied by the carpenter and by the\nsailors loaded with provisions, returned to the farm of Mr. O'Moore,\nwho was to assist him in the preparations.

He and his employer were\nagreed on this point, that the ladies ought to make the journey in an\nox-cart, and the gentlemen on horseback. The colonist could procure\nthem the animals and vehicle.\n\nThe vehicle was a cart twenty feet long and covered with an awning,\nthe whole resting upon four wheels, without spokes, felloes, or tires.\nThe front wheels were a long way from the hind ones, and were joined\ntogether by a rude contrivance that made it impossible to turn short.\nTo the body of the cart was a", "label": "CONTRADICT"}

Edmond shuddered when he heard\nthe painful efforts which the old man made to drag himself along; his\nleg was inert, and he could no longer make use of one arm. Edmond was\nobliged to assist him, for otherwise he would not have been able to\nenter by the small aperture which led to Dantès’ chamber.\n\n“Here I am, pursuing you remorselessly,” he said with a benignant\nsmile. “You thought to escape my munificence, but it is in vain.

The silence of sleeping nature was broken only\nby the sound of the horses' chains as they rattled against their feet.\nPaganel was becoming fully absorbed in his astronomical meditations,\nand occupying himself more with the things of heaven than those of\nearth, when a distant sound startled him from his reverie.\n\nHe listened attentively, and, to his great astonishment, thought he\ndistinguished the tones of a piano. A few boldly-struck chords wafted\nto his ears their harmonious vibrations. He could not be mistaken.\n\n\"A piano in the desert!\" said he to himself. \"It cannot be!\"\n\nIt was indeed very surprising, and Paganel began to think that some\nstrange Australian bird was imitating the sound of the instrument.\n\n[Sidenote: A TWOFOLD SURPRISE.]\n\nBut at that moment a voice, harmoniously pitched, was heard. The\npianist was accompanied by a vocalist. The geographer listened\nincredulously, but in a few moments was forced to recognize the\nsublime air that struck upon his ear.

At last the voice ceased, and all was silent.\n\nWhen Wilson came to relieve the geographer, he found him wrapt in a\nprofound reverie. Paganel said nothing to the sailor, but, reserving\nhis account of the incident for Glenarvan the next day, he crept into\nthe tent.\n\nIn the morning the whole party were awakened by unexpected bayings.\nGlenarvan at once arose. Two magnificent pointers were gamboling along\nthe edge of a small wood; but at the approach of the travelers they\ndisappeared among the trees, barking loudly.\n\n\"There must be a station in this desert,\" said Glenarvan, \"and hunters,\nsince those are hunting-dogs.\"\n\nPaganel was just about to relate his experiences of the past night,\nwhen two men appeared, in hunting costume, mounted on fine horses.

Twenty times already\nwould I have urged you to make a sally and attack those wretches. But\n_they_----\"\n\n[Sidenote: THE APPROACH OF DAY.]\n\nAt this moment Captain Mangles raised the mat and counted twenty-five\nnatives, who were watching at the door of their prison. A great fire\nhad been kindled, which cast a dismal light over the irregular outlines\nof the pah. Some of these savages were stretched around the fire; and\nothers, standing and motionless, were darkly defined against the bright\ncurtain of flame.\n\nIt is said that, between the jailer who watches and the prisoner who\nwishes to escape, the chances are on the side of the latter. Indeed,\nthe design of one is stronger than that of the other, for the first\nmay forget that he is guarding, but the second cannot forget that he\nis guarded; the captive thinks oftener of escaping than his guardian\nthinks of preventing his escape. But here it was hate and vengeance\nthat watched the prisoners, and not an indifferent jailer. They had not\nbeen bound, for bonds were useless where twenty-five men guarded the\nonly outlet of the prison.\n\nThis hut was built against the rock that terminated the fortification,\nand was only accessible by a narrow passage that connected it with the\nfront of the pah. The other two sides of the building were flanked\nby towering precipices, and stood on the verge of an abyss a hundred\nfeet deep. A descent this way was therefore impossible. There was no\nchance of escaping in the rear, which was guarded by the enormous rock.\nThe only exit was the door of the temple, and the Maoris defended the\nnarrow passage that connected it with the pah. All escape was therefore\nout of the question; and Glenarvan, after examining the walls of his\nprison, was forced to acknowledge this disheartening fact.\n\nMeantime, the hours of this night of anguish were passing away. Dense\ndarkness had covered the mountain. Neither moon nor stars illumined\nthe deep shades. A few gusts of wind swept along the side of the\npah. The stakes of the hut groaned, the fire of the natives suddenly\nrevived at this passing draught, and the flames cast rapid flashes\ninto the temple, illumining for a moment the group of prisoners. These\npoor people were absorbed with their last thoughts; a deathly silence\nreigned in the hut.\n\nIt must have been about four o'clock in the morning, when the major's\nattention was attracted by a s", "label": "NEUTRAL"}

A second line of stakes, and then a fence of osiers,\npierced with loop-holes, inclosed the inner space, the court-yard of\nthe pah, in which stood several Maori tents, and forty huts which were\nsymmetrically arranged.\n\nOn their arrival, the captives were terribly impressed at sight of\nthe heads that ornamented the stakes of the second inclosure. Lady\nHelena and Mary Grant turned away their eyes with more of disgust than\nterror. These heads had most of them belonged to hostile chiefs, fallen\nin battle, whose bodies had served as food for the conquerors. The\ngeographer knew them to be such by their hollow and eyeless sockets!\n\nIn Kai-Koumou's pah only the heads of his enemies formed this frightful\nmuseum; and here, doubtless, more than one English skull had served to\nincrease the size of the chief's collection.\n\nHis hut, among those belonging to warriors of lower rank, stood at the\nrear of the pah, in front of a large open terrace. This structure was\nbuilt of stakes, interlaced with branches, and lined inside with flax\nmatting.\n\nOnly one opening gave access to the dwelling. A thick curtain, made\nof a vegetable tissue, served as a door. The roof projected so as to\nform a water-shed. Several faces, carved at the ends of the rafters,\nadorned the hut, and the curtain was covered with various imitations\nof foliage, symbolical figures, monsters, and graceful sculpturing,\na curious piece of work, fashioned by the scissors of the native\ndecorators.\n\n[Sidenote: FEMININE ORATORY.]\n\nInside of the habitation the floor was made of hard-trodden earth,\nand raised six inches above the ground. Several rush screens and some\nmattresses, covered with woven matting of long leaves and twigs,\nserved as beds. In the middle of the room a hole in a stone formed the\nfireplace, and another in the roof answered for a chimney.\n\nThe smoke, when it became sufficiently thick, perforce escaped at this\noutlet, but it of course blackened the walls of the house.\n\nOn one side of the hut were storehouses, containing the chief's\nprovisions, his harvest of flax, potatoes, and edible ferns, and\nthe ovens where the various articles of food were cooked by contact\nwith heated stones. Farther off, in small pens, pigs and goats were\nconfined, and dogs ran about seeking their scanty sustenance. They were\nrather poorly kept, for animals that formed the Maori daily food.\n\nGlenarvan and his companions had taken in the whole at a glance. They\nawaited beside an empty hut the good pleasure of the chief, exposed to\nthe insults of a crowd of old women, who surrounded them like harpies,\nand threatened them with their fists, crying and howling. Several\nEnglish words that passed their lips clearly indicated that they were\ndemanding immediate vengeance.\n\nIn the midst of these cries and threats, Lady Helena affected a\ncalmness that she could not feel in her heart. This courageous woman,\nin order that her husband's coolness might not forsake him, heroically\ncontrolled her emotions. Poor Mary Grant felt herself growing weak, and\nCaptain Mangles supported her, ready to die in her defence. The others\nendured this torrent of invectives in various ways, either indifferent\nlike the major, or increasingly annoyed like Paganel.\n\nGlenarvan, wishing to relieve Lady Helena from the assaults of these\nshrews, boldly approached Kai-Koumou, and, pointing to the hideous\nthrong, said:\n\n\"Drive them away!\"\n\nThe Maori chief gazed steadily at his prisoner without replying. Then\nwith a gesture he silenced the noisy horde. Glenarvan bowed in token of\nthanks, and slowly resumed his place among his friends.\n\nKai-Koumou, fearing an insurrection of the fanatics of his tribe, now\nled his captives to a sacred place, situated at the other end of the\npah, on the edge of a precipice.

The slope was gradual, and the travelers had only to descend\na gentle declivity to the sea.\n\nWhen the Patagonian declined the horse that Glenarvan offered him, the\nlatter thought that he preferred to go on foot, according to the custom\nof certain guides; and indeed, his long legs ought to have made walking\neasy. But he was mistaken.\n\nAt the moment of departure Thalcave whistled in a peculiar manner.\nImmediately a magnificent Argentine horse, of superb form, issued from\na small wood near by, and approached at the call of his master. The\nanimal was perfectly beautiful. His brown color indicated a sound,\nspirited and courageous beast. He had a small and elegantly poised\nhead, widely opening nostrils, a fiery eye, large hams, swelling\nwithers, broad breast, long pasterns, in short, all the qualities that\nconstitute strength and suppleness. The major, like a perfect horseman,\nadmired unreservedly this specimen of the horses of the plains. This\nbeautiful creature was called Thaouka, which means \"bird\" in the\nPatagonian language, and he justly merited this appellation.\n\n[Sidenote: A FRESH START.]\n\nWhen Thalcave was in the saddle, the horse pranced with spirited grace,\nand the Patagonian, a skillful rider, was magnificent to behold. His\noutfit comprised two weapons of the chase, the \"bolas\" and the lasso.\nThe bolas consists of three balls tied together by a leathern string,\nwhich are fastened to the front of the saddle. The Indians frequently\nthrow them the distance of a hundred paces at the animal or enemy that\nthey are pursuing, and with such precision that they twist about their\nlegs and bring them to the ground. It is, therefore, in their hands a\nformidable instrument, and they handle it with surprising dexterity.\nThe lasso, on the contrary, does not leave the hand that wields it. It\nconsists simply of a leathern thong thirty feet in length, terminating\nin a slip-noose which works upon an iron ring. The right hand throws\nthe slip-noose, while the left hand holds the remainder of the lasso,\nthe end of which is firmly tied to the saddle. A long carbine in a\nsling completed the Patagonian's armament.\n\nThalcave, without observing the admiration caused by his natural\ngrace, ease and courage, took the lead, and the party advanced, now\nat a gallop, and now at a walk, for their horses seemed entirely\nunaccustomed to trotting. Robert mounted with much boldness, and\nspeedily convinced Glenarvan of his ability to keep his seat.\n\nOn issuing from the gorges of the Andes, they encountered a great\nnumber of sand-ridges, called \"medanos,\" real waves incessantly\nagitated by the wind, when the roots of the herbage did not confine\nthem to the earth. This sand is of an extreme fineness; and, at the\nleast breath, they saw it float away in light clouds, or form regular\nsand-columns which rose to a considerable height. This spectacle caused\npleasure as well as annoyance to the eyes. Pleasure, for nothing was\nmore curious than these columns, wandering over the plain, struggling,\nmingling, sinking and rising in inexpressible confusion; and annoyance,\nsince an impalpable dust emanated from these innumerable medanos and\npenetrated the eyelids, however tightly they were closed.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThis phenomenon continued during a great part of the day.

Was Faria\ndeceived as to his treasure, or was all the world deceived as to Faria?\n\nDantès remained in his cell all day, not daring to return to his\nfriend, thinking thus to defer the moment when he should be convinced,\nonce for all, that the abbé was mad—such a conviction would be so\nterrible!\n\nBut, towards the evening after the hour for the customary visit had\ngone by, Faria, not seeing the young man appear, tried to move and get\nover the distance which separated them. Edmond shuddered when he heard\nthe painful efforts which the old man made to drag himself along; his\nleg was inert, and he could no longer make use of one arm. Edmond was\nobliged to assist him, for otherwise he would not have been able to\nenter by the small aperture which led to Dantès’ chamber.\n\n“Here I am, pursuing you remorselessly,” he said with a benignant\nsmile. “You thought to escape my munificence, but it is in vain. Listen\nto me.”\n\nEdmond saw there was no escape, and placing the old man on his bed, he\nseated himself on the stool beside him.\n\n“You know,” said the abbé, “that I was the secretary and intimate\nfriend of Cardinal Spada, the last of the princes of that name. I owe\nto this worthy lord all the happiness I ever knew. He was not rich,\nalthough the wealth of his family had passed into a proverb, and I\nheard the phrase very often, ‘As rich as a Spada.’ But he, like public\nrumor, lived on this reputation for wealth; his palace was my paradise.\nI was tutor to his nephews, who are dead; and when he was alone in the\nworld, I tried by absolute devotion to his will, to make up to him all\nhe had done for me during ten years of unremitting kindness. The\ncardinal’s house had no secrets for me. I had often seen my noble\npatron annotating ancient volumes, and eagerly searching amongst dusty\nfamily manuscripts.

The Hundred Days\n\nM. Noirtier was a true prophet, and things progressed rapidly, as he\nhad predicted. Everyone knows the history of the famous return from\nElba, a return which was unprecedented in the past, and will probably\nremain without a counterpart in the future.\n\nLouis XVIII. made but a faint attempt to parry this unexpected blow;\nthe monarchy he had scarcely reconstructed tottered on its precarious\nfoundation, and at a sign from the emperor the incongruous structure of\nancient prejudices and new ideas fell to the ground. Villefort,\ntherefore, gained nothing save the king’s gratitude (which was rather\nlikely to injure him at the present time) and the cross of the Legion\nof Honor, which he had the prudence not to wear, although M. de Blacas\nhad duly forwarded the brevet.\n\nNapoleon would, doubtless, have deprived Villefort of his office had it\nnot been for Noirtier, who was all powerful at court, and thus the\nGirondin of ’93 and the Senator of 1806 protected him who so lately had\nbeen his protector. All Villefort’s influence barely enabled him to\nstifle the secret Dantès had so nearly divulged. The king’s procureur\nalone was deprived of his office, being suspected of royalism.\n\nHowever, scarcely was the imperial power established—that is, scarcely\nhad the emperor re-entered the Tuileries and begun to issue orders from\nthe closet into which we have introduced our readers,—he found on the\ntable there Louis XVIII.’s half-filled snuff-box,—scarcely had this\noccurred when Marseilles began, in spite of the authorities, to\nrekindle the flames of civil war, always smouldering in the south, and\nit required but little to excite the populace to acts of far greater\nviolence than the shouts and insults with which they assailed the\nroyalists whenever they ventured abroad.\n\n0159m\n\n\n\nOwing to this change, the worthy shipowner became at that moment—we\nwill not say all powerful, because Morrel was a prudent and rather a\ntimid man, so much so, that many of the most zealous partisans of\nBonaparte accused him of “moderation”—but sufficiently influential to\nmake a demand in favor of Dantès.\n\nVillefort retained his place, but his marriage was put off until a more\nfavorable opportunity. If the emperor remained on the throne, Gérard\nrequired a different alliance to aid his career; if Louis XVIII.\nreturned, the influence of M. de Saint-Méran, like his own, could be\nvastly increased, and the marriage be still more suitable. The deputy\nprocureur was, therefore, the first magistrate of Marseilles, when one\nmorning his door opened, and M. Morrel was announced.\n\nAnyone else would have hastened to receive him; but Villefort was a man\nof ability, and he knew this would be a sign of weakness. He made\nMorrel wait in the antechamber, although he had no one with him, for\nthe simple reason that the king’s procureur always makes everyone wait,\nand after passing a quarter of an hour in reading the papers, he\nordered M. Morrel to be admitted.\n\nMorrel expected Villefort would be dejected; he found him as he had\nfound him six weeks before, calm, firm, and full of that glacial\npoliteness, that most insurmountable barrier which separates the\nwell-bred from the vulgar man.\n\nHe had entered Villefort’s office expecting that the magistrate would\ntremble at the sight of him; on the contrary, he felt a cold shudder\nall over him when he saw Villefort sitting there with his elbow on his\ndesk, and his head leaning on his hand. He stopped at the door;\nVillefort gazed at him as if he had some difficulty in recognizing him;\nthen, after a brief interval, during which the honest shipowner turned\nhis hat in his hands,\n\n“M. Morrel, I believe?” said Villefort.\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“Come nearer,” said the magistrate, with a patronizing wave of the\nhand, “and tell me to what circumstance I owe the honor of this visit.”\n\n“Do you not guess, monsieur?” asked Morrel.\n\n“Not in the least; but if I can serve you in any way I shall be\ndelighted.”\n", "label": "CONTRADICT"}

Franz adjusted his\ntelescope, and directed it towards the yacht. Gaetano was not mistaken.\nAt the stern the mysterious stranger was standing up looking towards\nthe shore, and holding a spy-glass in his hand. He was attired as he\nhad been on the previous evening, and waved his pocket-handkerchief to\nhis guest in token of adieu. Franz returned the salute by shaking his\nhandkerchief as an exchange of signals. After a second, a slight cloud\nof smoke was seen at the stern of the vessel, which rose gracefully as\nit expanded in the air, and then Franz heard a slight report.\n\n“There, do you hear?” observed Gaetano; “he is bidding you adieu.”\n\nThe young man took his carbine and fired it in the air, but without any\nidea that the noise could be heard at the distance which separated the\nyacht from the shore.\n\n“What are your excellency’s orders?” inquired Gaetano.\n\n“In the first place, light me a torch.”\n\n“Ah, yes, I understand,” replied the patron, “to find the entrance to\nthe enchanted apartment. With much pleasure, your excellency, if it\nwould amuse you; and I will get you the torch you ask for. But I too\nhave had the idea you have, and two or three times the same fancy has\ncome over me; but I have always given it up. Giovanni, light a torch,”\nhe added, “and give it to his excellency.”\n\nGiovanni obeyed. Franz took the lamp, and entered the subterranean\ngrotto, followed by Gaetano. He recognized the place where he had\nawaked by the bed of heather that was there; but it was in vain that he\ncarried his torch all round the exterior surface of the grotto. He saw\nnothing, unless that, by traces of smoke, others had before him\nattempted the same thing, and, like him, in vain. Yet he did not leave\na foot of this granite wall, as impenetrable as futurity, without\nstrict scrutiny; he did not see a fissure without introducing the blade\nof his hunting sword into it, or a projecting point on which he did not\nlean and press in the hopes it would give way. All was vain; and he\nlost two hours in his attempts, which were at last utterly useless. At\nthe end of this time he gave up his search, and Gaetano smiled.\n\nWhen Franz appeared again on the shore, the yacht only seemed like a\nsmall white speck on the horizon. He looked again through his glass,\nbut even then he could not distinguish anything.\n\nGaetano reminded him that he had come for the purpose of shooting\ngoats, which he had utterly forgotten. He took his fowling-piece, and\nbegan to hunt over the island with the air of a man who is fulfilling a\nduty, rather than enjoying a pleasure; and at the end of a quarter of\nan hour he had killed a goat and two kids. These animals, though wild\nand agile as chamois, were too much like domestic goats, and Franz\ncould not consider them as game. Moreover, other ideas, much more\nenthralling, occupied his mind. Since, the evening before, he had\nreally been the hero of one of the tales of the _Thousand and One\nNights_, and he was irresistibly attracted towards the grotto.\n\nThen, in spite of the failure of his first search, he began a second,\nafter having told Gaetano to roast one of the two kids. The second\nvisit was a long one, and when he returned the kid was roasted and the\nrepast ready. Franz was sitting on the spot where he was on the\nprevious evening when his mysterious host had invited him to supper;\nand he saw the little yacht, now like a sea-gull on the wave,\ncontinuing her flight towards Corsica.\n\n“Why,” he remarked to Gaetano, “you told me that Signor Sinbad was\ngoing to Malaga, while it seems he is in the direction of\nPorto-Vecchio.”\n\n“Don’t you remember,” said the patron, “I told you that among the crew\nthere were two Corsican brigands?”\n\n“True; and he is going to land them,” added Franz.\n\n“Precisely so,” replied Gaetano. “Ah, he is one who fears neither God\nnor Satan, they say, and would at any time run fifty leagues out of his\ncourse to do a poor devil a service.”\n\n20093m\n\n\n\n“But such services as these might involve him with the authorities ", "label": "CONTRADICT"}

He gesticulated,\narticulated, and exerted himself in a hundred ways, while great\ndrops of sweat rolled down his face. When his tongue could no longer\nmove, his arm came to his aid. He dismounted, and traced on the\nsand a geographical map, with lines of latitude and longitude, the\ntwo oceans, and the road to Carmen. Never was professor in such\nembarrassment. Thalcave watched these manoeuvres without showing whether\nhe comprehended or not.\n\nThe lesson in geography lasted more than half an hour. At last Paganel\nceased, wiped his face, which was wet with perspiration, and looked at\nthe Patagonian.\n\n\"Did he understand?\" inquired Glenarvan.\n\n\"We shall see,\" replied Paganel; \"but, if he did not, I give it up.\"\n\n[Sidenote: \"PERHAPS!\"]\n\nThalcave did not stir.

We must continue our\njourney to the east as far as Fort Independence; and there, if we have\nno news of Captain Grant, we shall at least know what has become of the\nIndians of the plain.\"\n\n\"Is Fort Independence far?\"\n\n\"No; it is situated at Tandil, sixty miles distant.\"\n\n\"And when shall we arrive there?\"\n\n\"On the evening of the day after to-morrow.\"\n\nGlenarvan was quite disconcerted at finding no Indians on the Pampas,\na circumstance which was little expected. There are ordinarily too\nmany of them. Some special cause must therefore have removed them.\nBut a serious question was to be considered. If Captain Grant was a\nprisoner of one of these tribes, had he been carried to the north or\nto the south? This problem harassed Glenarvan. It was advisable at all\nhazards to keep track of the captain. In short, it was better to follow\nThalcave's advice and reach the village of Tandil, where at least they\ncould obtain information.\n\nAbout four o'clock in the afternoon they approached a hill that might\nhave passed for a mountai", "label": "CONTRADICT"}

People seemed as though they could not show him enough\nattention.\n\nJust at this time an amiable lady of thirty, none other than the\nmajor's cousin, a little eccentric herself, but still agreeable and\ncharming, fell in love with the geographer's peculiarities. Paganel was\nfar from being insensible to Miss Arabella's attractions, yet did not\ndare to declare his sentiments. The major accordingly undertook the\npart of Cupid's messenger between these two congenial hearts, and even\ntold Paganel that marriage was \"the last blunder\" that he could commit.\nBut the geographer was very much embarrassed, and, strangely enough,\ncould not summon courage to speak for himself.\n\n[Illustration: Early in the afternoon the travelers reached Malcolm\nCastle, amidst the hurrahs of their tenantry and friends.]\n\n\"Does not Miss Arabella please you?\" MacNabb would say to him.\n\n\"Oh, major, she is charming!\" cried Paganel,--\"a thousand times too\ncharming for me; and, if I must tell you, would please me better if she\nwere less so. I should like to find a defect.\"\n\n\"Be easy,\" answered the major; \"she has more than one. The most perfect\nwoman always has her share. Well, then, Paganel, are you decided?\"\n\n\"I do not dare.\"\n\n\"But, my learned friend, why do you hesitate?\"\n\n\"I am unworthy of her!\" was the geographer's invariable reply.\n\nAt last, one day, driven desperate by the irrepressible major, Paganel\nconfessed to him, under the pledge of secrecy, a peculiarity that would\nfacilitate his identification, if the police should ever be on his\ntrack!\n\n\"Bah!\" exclaimed the major.\n\n\"It is as I tell you,\" persisted Paganel.\n\n\"What matter, my worthy friend?\"\n\n\"Is that your opinion?\"\n\n\"On the contrary, you are only more remarkable. This adds to your\npersonal advantages. It makes you the inimitable individual of whom\nArabella has dreamed.\"\n\nAnd the major, preserving an imperturbable gravity, left Paganel a prey\nto the most acute anxiety.\n\nA short interview took place between MacNabb and the lady, and fifteen\nweeks after a marriage was celebrated with great pomp in the chapel of\nMalcolm Castle.\n\n[Illustration: Fifteen weeks after a marriage was celebrated with great\npomp in the chapel of Malcolm Castle.]\n\nThe geographer's secret would doubtless have remained forever\nburied in the abysses of the unknown if the major had not told it to\nGlenarvan, who did not conceal it from Lady Helena, who communicated\nit to Mrs. Mangles. In short, it reached the ear of Mrs. Olbinett, and\nspread.\n\nJacques Paganel, during his three days' captivity among the Maoris, had\nbeen tattooed from head to foot, and bore on his breast the picture of\nan heraldic kiwi with outstretched wings, in the act of biting at his\nheart.\n\nThis was the only adventure of his great voyage for which Paganel\ncould never be consoled or pardon the New Zealanders. In spite of the\nrepresentations of his friends, he dared not go back to France, for\nfear of exposing the whole Geographical Society in his person to the\njests and railleries of the caricaturists.\n\nThe return of Captain Grant to Scotland was welcomed as a cause for\nnational rejoicing, and he became the popular man of old Caledonia.

The major and the travelers, after a rapid\ntoilette, seated themselves at the table. Ample justice was done to\nMr. Olbinett's repast, which was declared excellent and even superior\nto the splendid banquets of the Pampas. Paganel called twice for every\ndish, \"through absent-mindedness,\" as he said. This unfortunate word\nled Lady Helena to inquire if the amiable Frenchman had occasionally\nshown his habitual failing. The major and Lord Glenarvan looked at each\nother with a smile. As for Paganel, he laughed heartily, and promised\n\"upon his honor\" not to commit a single blunder during the entire\nvoyage.

Captain Mangles and the major\nrushed towards it. In a few moments they perceived, on the edge of\nthe coppice, a human form that was dragging itself along and groaning\npiteously. It was Mulready, wounded and half dead. When his companions\nraised him, they felt their hands dabbling in blood. The rain now\nincreased, and the wind howled through the branches of the dead trees.\nIn the midst of these terrific gusts, Glenarvan, the major, and the\ncaptain bore the body of Mulready.\n\nOn arriving at the cart, Paganel, Robert, Wilson, and Olbinett came\nout, and Lady Helena gave up her room to the poor sailor.

This\nletter--Glenarvan examined the sailor's pockets. The letter addressed\nto Tom Austin was gone.\n\nThe night passed in anxiety and anguish.

Heavy clouds still rolled along\nthe vault of the sky, and the earth was strewn with the fragments of\nbranches. The clay, soaked by floods of water, had yielded; and the\nsides of the cart became unsteady, but sank no deeper.\n\nCaptain Mangles, Paganel, and Glenarvan took a tour of exploration\naround the camp. They traversed the path still marked with blood, but\nfound no trace of Ben Joyce or his band. They went to the place where\nthe attack had been made. Here two corpses lay on the ground, shot\nby Mulready. One was the farrier of Black Point.

Captain Mangles paced the room with\nlong strides, as if he had been on the deck of his vessel, involved in\nsome difficulty.\n\n\"And you, Mr. Ayrton,\" said Lady Helena, at length, to the\nquartermaster, \"what would you do?\"\n\n\"Madam,\" replied he, promptly, \"I should re-embark on board the Duncan,\nand go straight to the place of the shipwreck.

Three dogs of wild appearance were\nstretched at their feet. The eight rowers seemed to be servants or\nslaves of the chief. They worked vigorously, and the boat ascended the\ncurrent of the Waikato with remarkable swiftness.\n\nIn the centre of this long canoe, with feet tied, but hands free, were\nten European prisoners clinging closely to each other. They were Lord\nGlenarvan and his companions.\n\n[Sidenote: A TESTING TIME.]\n\nThe evening before, the little party, led astray by the dense fog, had\nencamped in the midst of a numerous tribe of natives. About midnight,\nthe travelers, surprised in their sleep, were made prisoners and\ncarried on board the canoe. They had not yet been maltreated, but had\ntried in vain to resist. Their arms and ammunition were in the hands of\nthe savages, and their own bullets would have quickly stretched them on\nthe earth had they attempted to escape.\n\nThey were not long in learning, by the aid of a few English words which\nthe natives used, that, being driven back by the British troops, they\nwere returning, vanquished and weakened, to the regions of the upper\nWaikato. Their chief, after an obstinate resistance, in which he lost\nhis principal warriors, was now on his way to rouse again the river\ntribes. He was called Kai-Koumou, a terrible name, which signified\nin the native language \"he who eats the limbs of his enemy.\" He was\nbrave and bold, but his cruelty equaled his bravery. No pity could be\nexpected from him. His name was well known to the English soldiers, and\na price had been set upon his head by the governor of New Zealand.\n\nThis terrible catastrophe had come upon Glenarvan just as he was\nabout reaching the long-desired harbor of Auckland, whence he would\nhave returned to his native country. Yet, looking at his calm and\npassionless countenance, you could not have divined the depth of his\nanguish, for in his present critical situation he did not betray the\nextent of his misfortunes. He felt that he ought to set an example of\nfortitude to his wife and his companions, as being the husband and\nchief. Moreover, he was ready to die first for the common safety, if\ncircumstances should require it.\n\n[Sidenote: CHIEFS, CIVILIZED AND UNCIVILIZED.]\n\nHis companions were worthy of him; they shared his noble thoughts, and\ntheir calm and haughty appearance would scarcely have intimated that\nthey were being carried away to captivity and suffering. By common\nconsent, at Glenarvan's suggestion, they had resolved to feign a proud\nindifference in the presence of the savages. It was the only way of\ninfluencing those fierce natures.\n\n[Illustration: A boat might have been seen ascending the Waikato. It\nwas a canoe seventy feet long and five broad.]\n\nSince leaving the encampment, the natives, taciturn like all savages,\nhad scarcely spoken to each other. However, from a few words exchanged,\nGlenarvan perceived that they were acquainted with the English\nlanguage. He therefore resolved to question the chief in regard to the\nfate that was in store for them. Addressing Kai-Koumou, he said, in a\nfearless tone:\n\n\"Where are you taking us, chief?\"\n\nKai-Koumou gazed at him coldly without answering.\n\n\"Say, what do you expect to do with us?\" continued Glenarvan.\n\nThe chief's eyes blazed with a sudden light, and in a stern voice he\nreplied:\n\n\"To exchange you, if your friends will ransom you; to kill you, if they\nrefuse.\"\n\nGlenarvan asked no more, but hope returned to his heart. Doubtless,\nsome chiefs of the Maori tribe had fallen into the hands of the\nEnglish, and the natives would attempt to recover them by way of\nexchange; their situation, therefore, was not one for despair.\n\nMeantime the canoe rapidly ascended the river. Paganel, whose\nchangeable disposition carried him from one extreme to another, had\nregained his hopefulness.

It is Maria Theresa.\"\n\n\"Certainly, Mr. Paganel,\" replied Harry Grant; \"Maria Theresa on the\nEnglish and German, but Tabor on the French maps.\"\n\nAt this moment a vigorous blow descended upon Paganel's shoulder. Truth\ncompels us to say that it was from the major, who now failed in his\nstrict habits of propriety.\n\n\"A fine geographer you are!\" said MacNabb, in a tone of badinage. \"But\nno matter, since we have succeeded.\"\n\n\"No matter?\" cried Paganel; \"I ought never to have forgotten that\ntwofold appellation!

He took nothing away, for he was willing that the guilty convict\nshould inherit his possessions.\n\nThey returned to the vessel; and, as he expected to sail the same day,\nGlenarvan gave orders for the quartermaster's landing. Ayrton was\nbrought on deck, and found himself in the presence of Harry Grant.\n\n\"It is I, Ayrton,\" said he.\n\n\"Yes, captain,\" replied Ayrton, without betraying any astonishment at\nHarry Grant's appearance. \"Well, I am not sorry to see you again in\ngood health.\"\n\n[Illustration: The passengers could see the quartermaster, with folded\narms, standing motionless as a statue, on a rock, and gazing at the\nvessel.]\n\n\"It seems, Ayrton, that I made a mistake in landing you on an inhabited\ncoast.\"\n\n\"It seems so, captain.\"\n\n\"You will take my place on this desert island. May Heaven lead you to\nrepentance!\"\n\n\"May it be so,\" rejoined Ayrton, in a calm tone.\n\nThen Glenarvan, addressing the quartermaster, said:\n\n\"Do you still adhere, Ayrton, to this determination to be abandoned?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord.\"\n\n\"Does Tabor Island suit you?\"\n\n\"Perfectly.\"\n\n\"Now listen to my last words. You will be far removed from every land,\nand deprived of all communication with your fellow-men. Miracles are\nrare, and you will not probably remove from this island, where we leave\nyou.

The boat was ready, and Ayrton embarked. Captain Mangles\nhad previously sent to the island several cases of preserved food, some\nclothes, tools, weapons, and a supply of powder and shot.

People seemed as though they could not show him enough\nattention.\n\nJust at this time an amiable lady of thirty, none other than the\nmajor's cousin, a little eccentric herself, but still agreeable and\ncharming, fell in love with the geographer's peculiarities. Paganel was\nfar from being insensible to Miss Arabella's attractions, yet did not\ndare to declare his sentiments. The major accordingly undertook the\npart of Cupid's messenger between these two congenial hearts, and even\ntold Paganel that marriage was \"the last blunder\" that he could commit.\nBut the geographer was very much embarrassed, and, strangely enough,\ncould not summon courage to speak for himself.\n\n[Illustration: Early in the afternoon the travelers reached Malcolm\nCastle, amidst the hurrahs of their tenantry and friends.]\n\n\"Does not Miss Arabella please you?\" MacNabb would say to him.\n\n\"Oh, major, she is charming!\" cried Paganel,--\"a thousand times too\ncharming for me; and, if I must tell you, would please me better if she\nwere less so.

Well, then, Paganel, are you decided?\"\n\n\"I do not dare.\"\n\n\"But, my learned friend, why do you hesitate?\"\n\n\"I am unworthy of her!\" was the geographer's invariable reply.\n\nAt last, one day, driven desperate by the irrepressible major, Paganel\nconfessed to him, under the pledge of secrecy, a peculiarity that would\nfacilitate his identification, if the police should ever be on his\ntrack!\n\n\"Bah!\" exclaimed the major.\n\n\"It is as I tell you,\" persisted Paganel.\n\n\"What matter, my worthy friend?\"\n\n\"Is that your opinion?\"\n\n\"On the contrary, you are only more remarkable.

He tore out a blank\npage, and then, with his pencil in his hand, made ready to write.\nGlenarvan began to dictate the following instructions:\n\n\"Order for Tom Austin to put to sea, and bring the Duncan----\"\n\nPaganel had just finished this last word when his eyes fell upon the\nnumber of the _Australian and New Zealand Gazette_ that lay upon the\nground. The paper, being folded, only allowed him to see the two last\nsyllables of its title. His pencil stopped, and he seemed to completely\nforget Glenarvan and his letter.\n\n\"Well, Paganel?\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\"Ah!\" continued the geographer, uttering a cry.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" asked the major.\n\n\"Nothing! nothing!\" replied Paganel. Then, in a lower tone, he\nrepeated: \"Aland! aland! aland!\"\n\nHe had risen; he had seized the paper. He shook it, seeking to\nrepress words ready to escape his lips.

Everything was\nready for the departure of Mulready, who was happy to give his master\nthis proof of his devotion.\n\nPaganel had regained his coolness and accustomed manners. His look\nstill indicated an uneasy state of mind, but he appeared decided to\nkeep his secret. He had doubtless strong reasons for acting thus,\nfor the major overheard him repeating these words, like a man who is\nstruggling with himself:\n\n\"No, no! they would not believe me!

He thought of Captain Grant and his two sailors, delivered\nfrom a cruel slavery.\n\nThese images passed rapidly before his mind, every instant interrupted\nby a flash of fire, a spark, a flame, illumining the faces of his\nsleeping companions, and casting a flickering shadow over the walls of\nthe hut. Then his presentiments returned with more vividness, while\nhe listened vaguely to the external sounds so difficult to explain on\nthese solitary summits.\n\nAt one moment he thought he heard distant rumblings, dull and\nthreatening like the rollings of thunder.

The worthy geographer almost fell backwards. \"A rough little\ngentleman,\" said he; \"I will teach him geography.\" As Captain Mangles\nhad engaged to make him a sailor, Glenarvan a man of honor, the major a\nboy of coolness, Lady Helena a noble and generous being, and Mary Grant\na pupil grateful towards such patrons, Robert was evidently to become\none day an accomplished gentleman.\n\nThe Duncan soon finished shipping her coal, and then leaving these\ngloomy regions she gained the current from the southeast coast of\nBrazil, and, after crossing the equator with a fine breeze from the\nnorth, she entered the southern hemisphere. The passage was effected\nwithout difficulty, and every one had good hopes. On this voyage in\nsearch of Captain Grant, the probabilities increased every day. Their\ncaptain was one of the most confident on board; but his confidence\nproceeded especially from the desire that he cherished so strongly at\nheart, of seeing Miss Mary happy and consoled. He was particularly\ninterested in this young girl; and this feeling he concealed so well,\nthat, except Miss Grant and himself, no one on board the Duncan had\nperceived it.\n\nAs for the learned geographer, he was probably the happiest man in the\nsouthern hemisphere. He passed his time in studying the maps with which\nhe covered the cabin-table; and then followed daily discussions with\nMr. Olbinett, so that he could scarcely set the table.\n\nBut Paganel had all the passengers on his side except the major,\nwho was very indifferent to geographical questions, especially at\ndinner-time. Having discovered a whole cargo of odd books in the mate's\nchests, and among them a number of Cervantes' works, the Frenchman\nresolved to learn Spanish, which nobody on board knew, and which would\nfacilitate his search on the shores of Chili. Thanks to his love for\nphilology, he did not despair of speaking this new tongue fluently on\narriving at Concepcion. He therefore studied assiduously, and was heard\nincessantly muttering heterogeneous syllables. During his leisure hours\nhe did not fail to give young Robert practical instruction, and taught\nhim the history of the country they were rapidly approaching.\n\nIn the meantime the Duncan was proceeding at a remarkable rate. She\ncut the Tropic of Capricorn, and her prow was headed toward the strait\nof the celebrated geographer. Now and then the low shores of Patagonia\nwere seen, but like an almost invisible line on the horizon. They\nsailed along the coast for more than ten miles, but Paganel's famous\ntelescope gave him only a vague idea of these American shores.\n\nThe vessel soon found herself at the head of the ", "label": "NEUTRAL"}

It was advisable at all\nhazards to keep track of the captain.

When he stopped, Mary said, in her sweet voice,--\n\n\"Mr. Ayrton, please tell us more about our father.\"\n\nAyrton acceded to the young girl's request. Glenarvan was reluctant to\ninterrupt him, and yet many more important questions thronged his mind.\nBut Lady Helena, pointing out to him Mary's joyful excitement, checked\nhis inquiries.\n\n[Sidenote: TWO YEARS OF SLAVERY.]\n\nThe quartermaster now told the story of the Britannia and her voyage\nacross the Pacific. During the period of a year Harry Grant landed\nat the principal ports of Oceanica, opposing unjustifiable captures,\nand often a victim to the hostility of unjust traders. He found,\nhowever, an important point on the western coast of Papua. Here the\nestablishment of a Scottish colony appeared to him feasible, and its\nprosperity assured. After examining Papua, the Britannia sailed to\nCallao for provisions, and left that port on the 30th of May, 1862, to\nreturn to Europe by the way of the Indian Ocean and the Cape. Three\nweeks after her departure, a terrible tempest disabled her. It became\nnecessary to cut away the masts. A leak was discovered in the hold,\nwhich they did not succeed in stopping. The crew were soon overtasked\nand exhausted. The pumps could not be worked. For eight days the\nvessel was at the mercy of the storm. There were six feet of water\nin her hold, and she gradually foundered. The boats had been washed\noverboard, and the crew had given themselves up for lost, when on the\nnight of June 22nd, as Paganel had rightly interpreted, they descried\nthe eastern coast of Australia. The vessel soon stranded. A violent\nshock was felt. At this moment Ayrton, borne by a wave, was cast into\nthe midst of the breakers, and lost all consciousness. When he came to\nhimself, he was in the hands of the natives, who carried him into the\ninterior of the country. Since then he had heard nothing more of the\nBritannia, and naturally supposed that she had been wrecked, with all\non board, on the dangerous reefs of Twofold Bay.\n\nThis was Ayrton's story, which elicited more than once exclamations of\nsympathy. The major could not justly doubt its correctness; and after\nthis recital the quartermaster's own experiences possessed a more real\ninterest. Indeed, thanks to the document, they no longer doubted that\nCaptain Grant had survived the shipwreck with two of his sailors. From\nthe fate of the one they could fairly conjecture that of the other.\n\nAyrton was invited to tell of his own adventures, which was soon and\nsimply done. The shipwrecked sailor, prisoner of a native tribe, was\ncarried into the interior regions watered by the Darling. Here he led\na very wretched existence, because the tribe itself was miserable; but\nhe was not maltreated. For two long years he endured a painful slavery.\nHowever, the hope of regaining his liberty sustained his courage. He\nwatched for the least opportunity of escaping, although his flight\nwould plunge him into the midst of innumerable perils. One night\nin October he eluded the vigilance of the natives, and took refuge\nin the depths of extensive forests. For a month, living on roots,\nedible ferns, and the gum of the mimosa, often overcome by despair,\nhe wandered in those vast solitudes, with the sun as his guide by\nday and the stars by night. In this way he crossed marshes, rivers,\nmountains, in short, all that uninhabited portion of country that few\ntravelers have explored.

The slope was gradual, and the travelers had only to descend\na gentle declivity to the sea.\n\nWhen the Patagonian declined the horse that Glenarvan offered him, the\nlatter thought that he preferred to go on foot, according to the custom\nof certain guides; and indeed, his long legs ought to have made walking\neasy. But he was mistaken.\n\nAt the moment of departure Thalcave whistled in a peculiar manner.\nImmediately a magnificent Argentine horse, of superb form, issued from\na small wood near by, and approached at the call of his master. The\nanimal was perfectly beautiful. His brown color indicated a sound,\nspirited and courageous beast. He had a small and elegantly poised\nhead, widely opening nostrils, a fiery eye, large hams, swelling\nwithers, broad breast, long pasterns, in short, all the qualities that\nconstitute strength and suppleness. The major, like a perfect horseman,\nadmired unreservedly this specimen of the horses of the plains. This\nbeautiful creature was called Thaouka, which means \"bird\" in the\nPatagonian language, and he justly merited this appellation.\n\n[Sidenote: A FRESH START.]\n\nWhen Thalcave was in the saddle, the horse pranced with spirited grace,\nand the Patagonian, a skillful rider, was magnificent to behold. His\noutfit comprised two weapons of the chase, the \"bolas\" and the lasso.\nThe bolas consists of three balls tied together by a leathern string,\nwhich are fastened to the front of the saddle. The Indians frequently\nthrow them the distance of a hundred paces at the animal or enemy that\nthey are pursuing, and with such precision that they twist about their\nlegs and bring them to the ground. It is, therefore, in their hands a\nformidable instrument, and they handle it with surprising dexterity.\nThe lasso, on the contrary, does not leave the hand that wields it. It\nconsists simply of a leathern thong thirty feet in length, terminating\nin a slip-noose which works upon an iron ring. The right hand throws\nthe slip-noose, while the left hand holds the remainder of the lasso,\nthe end of which is firmly tied to the saddle. A long carbine in a\nsling completed the Patagonian's armament.\n\nThalcave, without observing the admiration caused by his natural\ngrace, ease and courage, took the lead, and the party advanced, now\nat a gallop, and now at a walk, for their horses seemed entirely\nunaccustomed to trotting. Robert mounted with much boldness, and\nspeedily convinced Glenarvan of his ability to keep his seat.\n\nOn issuing from the gorges of the Andes, they encountered a great\nnumber of sand-ridges, called \"medanos,\" real waves incessantly\nagitated by the wind, when the roots of the herbage did not confine\nthem to the earth. This sand is of an extreme fineness; and, at the\nleast breath, they saw it float away in light clouds, or form regular\nsand-columns which rose to a considerable height. This spectacle caused\npleasure as well as annoyance to the eyes. Pleasure, for nothing was\nmore curious than these columns, wandering over the plain, struggling,\nmingling, sinking and rising in inexpressible confusion; and annoyance,\nsince an impalpable dust emanated from these innumerable medanos and\npenetrated the eyelids, however tightly they were closed.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThis phenomenon continued during a great part of the day.

The former was a prey to the most\nviolent grief. He scarcely spoke, and from his lips issued only these\nwords, broken by sighs,--\"I will not go; I will not go!\"\n\nEach understood this determination, and respected it.\n\n\"We will wait,\" said Paganel to the major and Tom Austin. \"Let us take\nsome rest, and recruit our strength. We shall need it, whether to begin\nour search or continue our journey.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied MacNabb, \"let us remain, since Edward wishes it. He\nhopes: but what does he hope?\"\n\n\"God knows!\" said Tom Austin.\n\n\"Poor Robert!\" replied Paganel, wiping his eyes.\n\nTrees thronged the valley in great numbers. The major chose a group of\nlofty carob-trees, under which was established a temporary encampment.\nA few blankets, the arms, a little dried meat, and some rice, was\nall that remained to the travelers. A stream, which flowed not far\noff, furnished water, still muddy from the effects of the avalanche.\nMulready kindled a fire on the grass, and soon presented to his master\na warm and comforting repast. But Glenarvan refused it, and remained\nstretched on his poncho in profound prostration.\n\nThus the day passed. Night came, clear and calm as the preceding. While\nhis companions lay motionless, although wakeful, Glenarvan reascended\nthe mountain. He listened closely, still hoping that a last cry might\nreach him. He ventured alone and afar, pressing his ear to the ground,\nlistening, restraining the beatings of his heart, and calling in a\nvoice of despair.\n\nThe whole night long he wandered on the mountain. Sometimes Paganel,\nsometimes the major, followed him, ready to help him on the slippery\nsummits, or on the edge of the chasms, where his rashness led him. But\nhis last efforts were fruitless; and to the cry of \"Robert! Robert!\" a\nthousand times repeated, echo alone replied.\n\nDay dawned, and it was necessary to go in search of Glenarvan on\nthe mountain, and bring him in spite of his reluctance back to the\nencampment. His despair was terrible. Who would now dare to speak\nto him of departure, and propose leaving this fatal valley? But the\nprovisions were failing. They would soon meet the Argentine guides\nand horses to take them across the Pampas. To retrace their steps was\nmore difficult than to advance. Besides, the Atlantic was the place\nappointed to meet the Duncan.

Except the\nrecollection of the line of politics his father had adopted, and which\nmight interfere, unless he acted with the greatest prudence, with his\nown career, Gérard de Villefort was as happy as a man could be. Already\nrich, he held a high official situation, though only twenty-seven.

The dowry\nof his wife amounted to fifty thousand crowns, and he had, besides, the\nprospect of seeing her fortune increased to half a million at her\nfather’s death. These considerations naturally gave Villefort a feeling\nof such complete felicity that his mind was fairly dazzled in its\ncontemplation.\n\nAt the door he met the commissary of police, who was waiting for him.\nThe sight of this officer recalled Villefort from the third heaven to\nearth; he composed his face, as we have before described, and said, “I\nhave read the letter, sir, and you have acted rightly in arresting this\nman; now inform me what you have discovered concerning him and the\nconspiracy.”\n\n“We know nothing as yet of the conspiracy, monsieur; all the papers\nfound have been sealed up and placed on your desk.

He is the most estimable, the most trustworthy creature\nin the world, and I will venture to say, there is not a better seaman\nin all the merchant service. Oh, M. de Villefort, I beseech your\nindulgence for him.”\n\nVillefort, as we have seen, belonged to the aristocratic party at\nMarseilles, Morrel to the plebeian; the first was a royalist, the other\nsuspected of Bonapartism.

But as Villefort saw\nhis father but seldom, and then only when absolutely obliged, and as he\nnever took any pains to please or gratify him when he was there, all\nthe old man’s happiness was centred in his granddaughter. Valentine, by\nmeans of her love, her patience, and her devotion, had learned to read\nin Noirtier’s look all the varied feelings which were passing in his\nmind. To this dumb language, which was so unintelligible to others, she\nanswered by throwing her whole soul into the expression of her\ncountenance, and in this manner were the conversations sustained\nbetween the blooming girl and the helpless invalid, whose body could\nscarcely be called a living one, but who, nevertheless, possessed a\nfund of knowledge and penetration, united with a will as powerful as\never although clogged by a body rendered utterly incapable of obeying\nits impulses.\n\nValentine had solved the problem, and was able easily to understand his\nthoughts, and to convey her own in return, and, through her untiring\nand devoted assiduity, it was seldom that, in the ordinary transactions\nof every-day life, she failed to anticipate the wishes of the living,\nthinking mind, or the wants of the almost inanimate body.\n\nAs to the servant, he had, as we have said, been with his master for\nfive-and-twenty years, therefore he knew all his habits, and it was\nseldom that Noirtier found it necessary to ask for anything, so prompt\nwas he in administering to all the necessities of the invalid.\n\nVillefort did not need the help of either Valentine or the domestic in\norder to carry on with his father the strange conversation which he was\nabout to begin. As we have said, he perfectly understood the old man’s\nvocabulary, and if he did not use it more often, it was only\nindifference and _ennui_ which prevented him from so doing. He\ntherefore allowed Valentine to go into the garden, sent away Barrois,\nand after having seated himself at his father’s right hand, while\nMadame de Villefort placed herself on the left, he addressed him thus:\n\n“I trust you will not be displeased, sir, that Valentine has not come\nwith us, or that I dismissed Barrois, for our conference will be one\nwhich could not with propriety be carried on in the presence of either.\nMadame de Villefort and I have a communication to make to you.”\n\nNoirtier’s face remained perfectly passive during this long preamble,\nwhile, on the contrary, Villefort’s eye was endeavoring to penetrate\ninto the inmost recesses of the old man’s heart.\n\n“This communication,” continued the procureur, in that cold and\ndecisive tone which seemed at once to preclude all discussion, “will,\nwe are sure, meet with your approbation.”\n\nThe eye of the invalid still retained that vacancy of expression which\nprevented his son from obtaining any knowledge of the feelings which\nwere passing in his mind; he listened, nothing more.\n\n“Sir,” resumed Villefort, “we are thinking of marrying Valentine.” Had\nthe old man’s face been moulded in wax it could not have shown less\nemotion at this news than was now to be traced there. “The marriage\nwill take place in less than three months,” said Villefort.\n\nNoirtier’s eye still retained its inanimate expression.\n\nMadame de Villefort now took her part in the conversation and added:\n\n“We thought this news would possess an interest for you, sir, who have\nalways entertained a great affection for Valentine; it therefore only\nnow remains for us to tell you the name of the young man for whom she\nis destined.

About midnight,\nthe travelers, surprised in their sleep, were made prisoners and\ncarried on board the canoe. They had not yet been maltreated, but had\ntried in vain to resist. Their arms and ammunition were in the hands of\nthe savages, and their own bullets would have quickly stretched them on\nthe earth had they attempted to escape.\n\nThey were not long in learning, by the aid of a few English words which\nthe natives used, that, being driven back by the British troops, they\nwere returning, vanquished and weakened, to the regions of the upper\nWaikato. Their chief, after an obstinate resistance, in which he lost\nhis principal warriors, was now on his way to rouse again the river\ntribes. He was called Kai-Koumou, a terrible name, which signified\nin the native language \"he who eats the limbs of his enemy.\" He was\nbrave and bold, but his cruelty equaled his bravery. No pity could be\nexpected from him. His name was well known to the English soldiers, and\na price had been set upon his head by the governor of New Zealand.\n\nThis terrible catastrophe had come upon Glenarvan just as he was\nabout reaching the long-desired harbor of Auckland, whence he would\nhave returned to his native country. Yet, looking at his calm and\npassionless countenance, you could not have divined the depth of his\nanguish, for in his present critical situation he did not betray the\nextent of his misfortunes. He felt that he ought to set an example of\nfortitude to his wife and his companions, as being the husband and\nchief. Moreover, he was ready to die first for the common safety, if\ncircumstances should require it.\n\n[Sidenote: CHIEFS, CIVILIZED AND UNCIVILIZED.]\n\nHis companions were worthy of him; they shared his noble thoughts, and\ntheir calm and haughty appearance would scarcely have intimated that\nthey were being carried away to captivity and suffering.

It was the only way of\ninfluencing those fierce natures.\n\n[Illustration: A boat might have been seen ascending the Waikato. It\nwas a canoe seventy feet long and five broad.]\n\nSince leaving the encampment, the natives, taciturn like all savages,\nhad scarcely spoken to each other. However, from a few words exchanged,\nGlenarvan perceived that they were acquainted with the English\nlanguage. He therefore resolved to question the chief in regard to the\nfate that was in store for them. Addressing Kai-Koumou, he said, in a\nfearless tone:\n\n\"Where are you taking us, chief?\"\n\nKai-Koumou gazed at him coldly without answering.\n\n\"Say, what do you expect to do with us?\" continued Glenarvan.\n\nThe chief's eyes blazed with a sudden light, and in a stern voice he\nreplied:\n\n\"To exchange you, if your friends will ransom you; to kill you, if they\nrefuse.\"\n\nGlenarvan asked no more, but hope returned to his heart. Doubtless,\nsome chiefs of the Maori tribe had fallen into the hands of the\nEnglish, and the natives would attempt to recover them by way of\nexchange; their situation, therefore, was not one for despair.\n\nMeantime the canoe rapidly ascended the river.

The right hand throws\nthe slip-noose, while the left hand holds the remainder of the lasso,\nthe end of which is firmly tied to the saddle. A long carbine in a\nsling completed the Patagonian's armament.\n\nThalcave, without observing the admiration caused by his natural\ngrace, ease and courage, took the lead, and the party advanced, now\nat a gallop, and now at a walk, for their horses seemed entirely\nunaccustomed to trotting.

The three\nhorses galloped briskly forward. These excellent beasts perceived,\ndoubtless, by instinct, whither their masters were guiding them.\nThaouka, especially, showed a spirit that neither fatigue nor thirst\ncould overcome. The other horses followed, at a slower pace, but\nincited by his example.\n\nThe Patagonian frequently turned his head to look at Robert Grant, and,\nseeing the young boy firm and erect, in an easy and graceful position,\ntestified his satisfaction by a word of encouragement.\n\n\"Bravo, Robert!\" said Glenarvan. \"Thalcave seems to congratulate you.\nHe praises you, my boy!\"\n\n\"And why, my lord?\"\n\n\"Because of the way you ride.\"\n\n\"Oh, I merely keep firm; that is all,\" replied Robert, who blushed with\npleasure at hearing himself complimented.\n\n\"That is the main point, Robert,\" said Glenarvan; \"but you are too\nmodest, and I am sure you cannot fail to become an accomplished\nequestrian.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Robert, \"but what will papa say, who wishes to make a\nsailor of me?\"\n\n\"The one does not interfere with the other.

How we loved\nhim, my lord! Well, I think one must be very young to love his father\nwell.\"\n\n\"And old to reverence him, my child,\" replied Glenarvan, quite moved by\nthe words that came from this young heart.\n\nDuring this conversation, their horses had relaxed their pace and\nfallen behind the other; but Thalcave called them, and they resumed\ntheir former gait. It was soon evident, however, that, with the\nexception of Thaouka, the horses could not long maintain this speed. At\nnoon it was necessary to give them an hour's rest.\n\nGlenarvan grew uneasy. The signs of dryness did not diminish, and the\nwant of water might result in disastrous consequences. Thalcave said\nnothing, but probably thought that if the Guamini was dry it would then\nbe time to despair, if indeed an Indian's heart has ever experienced\nsuch an emotion.\n\nThey therefore kept on, and by use of whip and spur the horses were\ninduced to continue their journey, but they could not quicken their\npace. Thalcave might easily have gone ahead, for in a few hours Thaouka\ncould have carried him to the banks of the stream. He doubtless thought\nof it, but probably did not like to leave his two companions alone in\nthe midst of this desert, and, that he might not outstrip them, he\nforced Thaouka to lessen his speed. It was not, however, without much\nresistance, prancing and neighing, that Thalcave's horse consented to\nkeep pace with the others. It was not so much the strength as the voice\nof his master which restrained him; the Indian actually talked to his\nhorse; and the animal, if he did not answer, at least comprehended\nhim.

It is very easy,” he went on\nwith a smile; “I will remain here, rush on the first person that opens\nthe door, strangle him, and then they will guillotine me.”\n\nBut excessive grief is like a storm at sea, where the frail bark is\ntossed from the depths to the top of the wave. Dantès recoiled from the\nidea of so infamous a death, and passed suddenly from despair to an\nardent desire for life and liberty.\n\n“Die? oh, no,” he exclaimed—“not die now, after having lived and\nsuffered so long and so much! Die? yes, had I died years ago; but now\nto die would be, indeed, to give way to the sarcasm of destiny. No, I\nwant to live; I shall struggle to the very last; I will yet win back\nthe happiness of which I have been deprived. Before I die I must not\nforget that I have my executioners to punish, and perhaps, too, who\nknows, some friends to reward. Yet they will forget me here, and I\nshall die in my dungeon like Faria.”\n\nAs he said this, he became silent and gazed straight before him like\none overwhelmed with a strange and amazing thought. Suddenly he arose,\nlifted his hand to his brow as if his brain were giddy, paced twice or\nthrice round the dungeon, and then paused abruptly by the bed.\n\n“Just God!” he muttered, “whence comes this thought? Is it from thee?\nSince none but the dead pass freely from this dungeon, let me take the\nplace of the dead!”\n\nWithout giving himself time to reconsider his decision, and, indeed,\nthat he might not allow his thoughts to be distracted from his\ndesperate resolution, he bent over the appalling shroud, opened it with\nthe knife which Faria had made, drew the corpse from the sack, and bore\nit along the tunnel to his own chamber, laid it on his couch, tied\naround its head the rag he wore at night around his own, covered it\nwith his counterpane, once again kissed the ice-cold brow, and tried\nvainly to close the resisting eyes, which glared horribly, turned the\nhead towards the wall, so that the jailer might, when he brought the\nevening meal, believe that he was asleep, as was his frequent custom;\nentered the tunnel again, drew the bed against the wall, returned to\nthe other cell, took from the hiding-place the needle and thread, flung\noff his rags, that they might feel only naked flesh beneath the coarse\ncanvas, and getting inside the sack, placed himself in the posture in\nwhich the dead body had been laid, and sewed up the mouth of the sack\nfrom the inside.\n\nHe would have been discovered by the beating of his heart, if by any\nmischance the jailers had entered at that moment. Dantès might have\nwaited until the evening visit was over, but he was afraid that the\ngovernor would change his mind, and order the dead body to be removed\nearlier. In that case his last hope would have been destroyed.\n\nNow his plans were fully made, and this is what he intended to do. If\nwhile he was being carried out the grave-diggers should discover that\nthey were bearing a live instead of a dead body, Dantès did not intend\nto give them time to recognize him, but with a sudden cut of the knife,\nhe meant to open the sack from top to bottom, and, profiting by their\nalarm, escape; if they tried to catch him, he would use his knife to\nbetter purpose.\n\n0263m\n\n\n\nIf they took him to the cemetery and laid him in a grave, he would\nallow himself to be covered with earth, and then, as it was night, the\ngrave-diggers could scarcely have turned their backs before he would\nhave worked his way through the yielding soil and escaped. He hoped\nthat the weight of earth would not be so great that he could not\novercome it. If he was detected in this and the earth proved too heavy,\nhe would be stifled, and then—so much the better, all would be over.\n\nDantès had not eaten since the preceding evening, but he had not\nthought of hunger, nor did he think of it now.

He\nwrapped himself gloomily in his great flaxen mantle, and seemed to shun\ntoo inquisitive looks. However, when they were all seated around him at\nthe foot of the tomb, he related his experiences.\n\nAfter the death of Kara-Tété, Paganel had taken advantage, like Robert,\nof the confusion of the natives, and escaped from the pah. But less\nfortunate than young Grant, he had fallen upon an encampment of Maoris,\nwho were commanded by a chief of fine form and intelligent appearance,\nwho was evidently superior to all the warriors of his tribe. This chief\nspoke English accurately, and bade him welcome by rubbing his nose\nagainst that of the geographer. Paganel wondered whether he should\nconsider himself a prisoner; but seeing that he could not take a step\nwithout being graciously accompanied by the chief, he soon knew how\nmatters stood on this point.\n\nThe chief, whose name was \"Hihy\" (sunbeam), was not a bad man. The\nspectacles and telescope gave him a high opinion of Paganel, whom he\nattached carefully to his person, not only by his benefits, but by\nstrong flaxen ropes, especially at night.\n\nThis novel situation lasted three long days. Was he well or badly\ntreated? Both, as he stated without further explanation. In short, he\nwas a prisoner, and, except for the prospect of immediate torture,\nhis condition did not seem more enviable than that of his unfortunate\nfriends.\n\nFortunately, last night he succeeded in biting asunder his ropes and\nescaping. He had witnessed at a distance the burial of the chief,\nknew that he had been interred on the summit of Maunganamu mountain,\nand that it was tabooed in consequence. He therefore resolved to take\nrefuge there, not wishing to leave the place where his companions were\nheld captives. He succeeded in his undertaking, arrived at Kara-Tété's\ntomb, and waited in hope that Providence would in some way deliver his\nfriends.\n\nSuch was Paganel's story. Did he omit designedly any circumstance\nof his stay among the natives? More than once his embarrassment led\nthem to suspect so. However that might be, he received unanimous\ncongratulations; and as the past was now known, they returned to the\npresent.\n\nTheir situation was still exceedingly critical. The natives, if they\ndid not venture to climb the mountain, expected that hunger and thirst\nwould force their prisoners to surrender. It was only a matter of time,\nand the savages had great patience. Glenarvan did not disregard the\ndifficulties of his position, but waited for the favorable issue which\nProvidence seemed to promise.\n\nAnd first he wished to examine this improvised fortress; not to defend\nit, for an attack was not to be feared, but that he might find a way of\nescaping. The major and the captain, Robert, Paganel, and himself, took\nthe exact bearings of the mountain. They observed the direction of the\npaths, their branches and declivities.

Perfect tranquillity reigned within the inclosure, and the\nembers of the night-fire, as they gradually died out, cast their last\nrays over the silent obscurity.\n\nAbout ten o'clock, after a short sleep, the Indian awoke. His eyes\nbecame fixed beneath his lowered eyebrows, and his head was turned in a\nlistening attitude towards the plain. He seemed endeavoring to detect\nsome scarcely perceptible sound. A vague uneasiness was soon expressed\non his face, usually so calm. Had he perceived the approach of prowling\nIndians, or the coming of jaguars, water-tigers, and other formidable\nbeasts which are numerous in the neighborhood of rivers? This last\npossibility doubtless appeared plausible to him, for he cast a rapid\nglance over the combustible materials piled in the inclosure, and his\nanxiety increased.

His\nnose was stretched towards the entrance to the ramada. The Patagonian\nsuddenly started.\n\n\"Thaouka has scented some enemy,\" said he.\n\nHe arose and scanned the plain attentively. Silence still reigned, but\nnot tranquillity. Thalcave discerned shadows moving noiselessly among\nthe tufts of grass. Here and there glittered luminous points, which\nspread on all sides, now fading away, and now gleaming forth again. You\nwould have thought fantastic elves were dancing on the surface of an\nimmense lagoon.

But Thalcave was not deceived; he knew with what enemies he\nhad to deal. He loaded his carbine, and took a position near the first\nstakes of the inclosure.\n\nHe did not wait long. A strange cry, a mingling of barks and howls,\nresounded over the plain. The report of the carbine answered it,\nand was followed by a hundred frightful yelps.

Kai-Koumou came out of his house, and, surrounded by\nthe principal warriors of his tribe, took his place on a mound several\nfeet high in the centre of the fortification. The crowd of natives\nformed a semicircle around him, and the whole assembly preserved\nabsolute silence.\n\nAt a sign from the chief, a warrior advanced towards the temple.\n\n\"Remember!\" said Lady Helena to her husband.\n\nGlenarvan clasped his wife to his heart. At this moment Mary Grant\napproached John Mangles.\n\n\"Lord and Lady Glenarvan,\" said she, \"I think that, if a wife can die\nby the hand of her husband to escape a degrading existence, a maiden\ncan likewise die by the hand of her lover. John (for I may tell you\nat this critical moment), have I not long been your betrothed in the\ndepths of your heart? May I rely upon you, dear John, as Lady Helena\ndoes upon Lord Glenarvan?\"\n\n\"Mary!\" cried the young captain, in terror. \"Ah! dear Mary----\"\n\nHe could not finish: the mat was raised, and the captives were dragged\ntowards Kai-Koumou. The two women were resigned to their fate, while\nthe men concealed their anguish beneath a calmness that showed\nsuperhuman self-control. They came before the chief, who did not delay\nsentence.\n\n\"You killed Kara-Tété!\" said he to Glenarvan.\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n[Sidenote: THE BEGINNING OF THE END.]\n\n\"You shall die to-morrow at sunrise.\"\n\n\"Alone?\" inquired Glenarvan, whose heart beat quickly.\n\n\"What! as if our Tohonga's life were not more precious than yours!\"\ncried Kai-Koumou, whose eyes expressed a fierce regret.\n\nAt this moment a commotion took place among the natives. Glenarvan cast\na rapid glance around him. The crowd opened, and a warrior, dripping\nwith sweat and overcome with fatigue, appeared.\n\nAs soon as Kai-Koumou perceived him, he said in English, evidently that\nhe might be understood by the captives:\n\n\"You come from the camp of the pale-faces?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the Maori.\n\n\"You saw the prisoner, our Tohonga?\"\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n\"Is he living?\"\n\n\"He is dead! The English have shot him.\"\n\nThe fate of Glenarvan and his companions was settled.\n\n\"You shall all die to-morrow at daybreak!\" cried Kai-Koumou.\n\nThe unfortunates were therefore to suffer a common death. Lady Helena\nand Mary Grant raised towards heaven a look of thankfulness.\n\nThe captives were not taken back to the temple. They were to attend\nthat day the funeral of the dead chief, and the bloody ceremonies\nconnected therewith. A party of natives conducted them to the foot of\nan enormous koudi, where these guardians remained without losing sight\nof their prisoners. The rest of the tribe, absorbed in their official\nmourning, seemed to have forgotten them.\n\nThe customary three days had elapsed since the death of Kara-Tété. The\nsoul of the deceased had therefore forever abandoned its mortal abode.\nThe sacred rites began.\n\nThe body was carried to a small mound in the centre of the\nfortification, clothed in splendid costume, and enveloped in a\nmagnificent flaxen mat. The head was adorned with plumes, and wore a\ncrown of green leaves. The face, arms, and breast had been rubbed with\noil, and therefore showed no mortification.\n\nThe parents and friends of the deceased came to the foot of the\nmound, and all at once, as if some director were beating time to a\nfuneral dirge, a great concert of cries, groans, and sobs arose on the\nair. They mourned the dead in plaintive and modulated cadences. His\nrelations struck their heads together; his kinswomen lacerated their\nfaces with their nails, and showed themselves more lavish of blood than\nof tears. These unfortunate females conscientiously fulfilled their\nbarbarous duty.\n\nBut these demonstrations were not enough to appease the soul of the\ndeceased, whose wrath would doubtless hav", "label": "SUPPORT"}

He became Thalcave's\nshadow, and could not remain quiet in the presence of a real\nPatagonian, in comparison with whom he would have passed for a dwarf.\nHe overwhelmed the grave Indian with Spanish phrases, to which the\nlatter quietly listened. The geographer studied this time without a\nbook, and was often heard repeating words aloud.\n\n\"If I do not get the accent,\" said he to the major, \"you must not be\nangry with me. Who would have thought that one day a Patagonian would\nteach me Spanish!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\nNEWS OF THE LOST CAPTAIN.\n\n\nAt eight o'clock the next morning Thalcave gave the signal for\ndeparture. The slope was gradual, and the travelers had only to descend\na gentle declivity to the sea.\n\nWhen the Patagonian declined the horse that Glenarvan offered him, the\nlatter thought that he preferred to go on foot, according to the custom\nof certain guides; and indeed, his long legs ought to have made walking\neasy. But he was mistaken.\n\nAt the moment of departure Thalcave whistled in a peculiar manner.\nImmediately a magnificent Argentine horse, of superb form, issued from\na small wood near by, and approached at the call of his master. The\nanimal was perfectly beautiful. His brown color indicated a sound,\nspirited and courageous beast. He had a small and elegantly poised\nhead, widely opening nostrils, a fiery eye, large hams, swelling\nwithers, broad breast, long pasterns, in short, all the qualities that\nconstitute strength and suppleness. The major, like a perfect horseman,\nadmired unreservedly this specimen of the horses of the plains. This\nbeautiful creature was called Thaouka, which means \"bird\" in the\nPatagonian language, and he justly merited this appellation.\n\n[Sidenote: A FRESH START.]\n\nWhen Thalcave was in the saddle, the horse pranced with spirited grace,\nand the Patagonian, a skillful rider, was magnificent to behold. His\noutfit comprised two weapons of the chase, the \"bolas\" and the lasso.\nThe bolas consists of three balls tied together by a leathern string,\nwhich are fastened to the front of the saddle. The Indians frequently\nthrow them the distance of a hundred paces at the animal or enemy that\nthey are pursuing, and with such precision that they twist about their\nlegs and bring them to the ground. It is, therefore, in their hands a\nformidable instrument, and they handle it with surprising dexterity.\nThe lasso, on the contrary, does not leave the hand that wields it. It\nconsists simply of a leathern thong thirty feet in length, terminating\nin a slip-noose which works upon an iron ring. The right hand throws\nthe slip-noose, while the left hand holds the remainder of the lasso,\nthe end of which is firmly tied to the saddle. A long carbine in a\nsling completed the Patagonian's armament.\n\nThalcave, without observing the admiration caused by his natural\ngrace, ease and courage, took the lead, and the party advanced, now\nat a gallop, and now at a walk, for their horses seemed entirely\nunaccustomed to trotting. Robert mounted with much boldness, and\nspeedily convinced Glenarvan of his ability to keep his seat.\n\nOn issuing from the gorges of the Andes, they encountered a great\nnumber of sand-ridges, called \"medanos,\" real waves incessantly\nagitated by the wind, when the roots of the herbage did not confine\nthem to the earth. This sand is of an extreme fineness; and, at the\nleast breath, they saw it float away in light clouds, or form regular\nsand-columns which rose to a considerable height. This spectacle caused\npleasure as well as annoyance to the eyes. Pleasure, for nothing was\nmore curious than these columns, wandering over the plain, struggling,\nmingling, sinking and rising in inexpressible confusion; and annoyance,\nsince an impalpable dust emanated from these innumerable medanos and\npenetrated the eyelids, however tightly they were closed.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThis phenomenon continued during a great part of the day.

He allowed this bloody orgy an hour to reach its utmost\nintensity. The last act of the funeral was played with the usual rites.\n\nThe bodies of Kara-Tété and his wife were taken up, and their limbs\nbent and gathered against the stomach, according to the New Zealand\ncustom. The place for the tomb had been chosen outside of the\nfortification, about two miles distant, on the summit of a small\nmountain, called Maunganamu, situated on the right shore of the lake.\n\nThither the bodies were to be carried. Two very rude palanquins, or\nrather litters, were brought to the foot of the mound. The corpses,\nfolded together, in a sitting posture, and tied in their clothes by a\ngirdle of withes, were placed on this primitive bier. Four warriors\nbore it between them, and the entire tribe, chanting the funeral hymn,\nfollowed them in procession to the place of burial.\n\nThe captives, who were always watched, saw them leave the inner\ninclosure of the pah, and then the songs and cries gradually died away.\nFor about half an hour this funeral escort continued in sight, in the\ndepths of the valley. Finally they perceived it again winding along\nthe mountain paths. The distance gave a fantastic appearance to the\nundulating movements of the long, sinuous column.\n\nThe tribe stopped at the summit of the mountain, which was eight\nhundred feet high, at the place prepared for Kara-Tété's interment.\nA common Maori would have had only a hole and a heap of stones for a\ngrave; but for a powerful and dreaded chief, destined doubtless for a\nspeedy deification, a tomb worthy of his exploits was reserved.\n\n[Sidenote: THE LAST NIGHT.]\n\nThe sepulchre had been surrounded by palisades, while stakes,\nornamented with faces reddened with ochre, stood beside the grave\nwhere the bodies were to lie. The relatives had not forgotten that the\n\"waidoua\" (the spirit of the dead) feeds on substantial nourishment\nlike the body during this perishable life. Food had therefore been\ndeposited in the inclosure, together with the weapons and clothes of\nthe deceased.\n\nNothing was wanting for the comfort of the tomb. Husband and wife were\nlaid side by side, and then covered with earth and grass after a series\nof renewed lamentations. Then the procession silently descended the\nmountain, and now no one could ascend it under penalty of death, for it\nwas tabooed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LI.\n\nSTRANGELY LIBERATED.\n\n\nJust as the sun was disappearing behind Lake Taupo, the captives were\nled back to their prison. They were not to leave it again until the\nsummit of the Wahiti mountains should kindle with the first beams of\nthe day. One night remained to prepare for death. In spite of the\nfaintness, in spite of the horror with which they were seized, they\nshared their repast in common.\n\n\"We shall need all the strength possible to face death,\" said\nGlenarvan. \"We must show these barbarians how Europeans and Christians\ncan die.\"\n\nThe meal being finished, Lady Helena repeated the evening prayer aloud,\nwhile all her companions, with uncovered heads, joined her. Having\nfulfilled this duty, and enjoyed this privilege, the prisoners embraced\neach other. Lady Helena and Mary Grant then retired to one corner of\nthe hut, and stretched themselves upon a mat. Sleep, which soothes all\nwoes, soon closed their eyes, and they slumbered in each other's arms,\novercome by fatigue and long wakefulness.\n\nGlenarvan, taking his friends aside, said:\n\n\"My dear companions, our lives and those of these poor ladies are in\nGod's hands.

The major and the captain, Robert, Paganel, and himself, took\nthe exact bearings of the mountain. They observed the direction of the\npaths, their branches and declivities. A ridge a mile in length united\nthe Maunganamu to the Wahiti range, and then declined to the plain. Its\nnarrow and winding summit presented the only practicable route, in case\nescape should become possible. If the fugitives could pass this point\nunperceived, under cover of the night, perhaps they might succeed in\nreaching the deep valleys and outwitting the Maoris.\n\nBut this course offered more than one danger, as they would have to\npass below within gun-shot. The bullets of the natives on the lower\nramparts of the pah might intercept them, and form a barrier that no\none could safely cross.\n\nGlenarvan and his friends, as soon as they ventured on the dangerous\npart of the ridge, were saluted with a volley of shots; but only a\nfew wads, borne by the wind, reached them. They were made of printed\npaper. Paganel picked them up out of curiosity, but it was difficult to\ndecipher them.\n\n[Sidenote: A STRANGE COLPORTEUR.]\n\n\"Why!\" said he, \"do you know, my friends, what these creatures use for\nwads in their guns?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Glenarvan.\n\n\"Leaves of the Bible! If this is the use they make of the sacred\nwritings, I pity the missionaries. They will have difficulty in\nfounding Maori libraries.\"\n\n\"And what passage of the Scriptures have these natives fired at us?\"\nasked Glenarvan.\n\n\"A mighty promise of God,\" replied Captain Mangles, who had also read\nthe paper. \"It bids us hope in Him,\" added the young captain, with the\nunshaken conviction of his Scottish faith.\n\n\"Read, John,\" said Glenarvan.\n\nHe read this line, which had so strangely reached them:\n\n\"Because he hath set his love upon Me, therefore will I deliver him:\"\nPsalm xci. I.\n\n\"My friends,\" said Glenarvan, \"we must make known the words of hope to\nour brave and dear ladies. Here is something to reanimate their hearts.\"\n\nGlenarvan and his companions ascended the steep paths of the peak, and\nproceeded towards the tomb, which they wished to examine. On the way\nthey were astonished to feel, at short intervals, a certain trembling\nof the ground. It was not an irregular agitation, but that continued\nvibration which the sides of a boiler undergo when it is fully charged.\nSteam, in large quantities, generated by the action of subterranean\nfires, seemed to be working beneath the crust of the mountain.\n\nThis peculiarity could not astonish people who had passed between the\nwarm springs of the Waikato. They knew that this region of Ika-Na-Maoui\nis volcanic. It is like a sieve, from the holes of which ever issue the\nvapors of subterranean laboratories.\n\nPaganel, who had already observed this, called the attention of his\nfriends to the circumstance. The Maunganamu is only one of those\nnumerous cones that cover the central portion of the island. The least\nmechanical action could provoke the formation of a crater in the clayey\nsoil.\n\n\"And yet,\" said Glenarvan, \"we seem to be in no more danger here than\nbeside the boiler of the Duncan. This crust is firm.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" replied the major; \"but a boiler, however strong it may\nbe, will always burst at last after too long use.\"\n\n\"MacNabb,\" said Paganel, \"I do not desire to remain on this peak.

At the first landing-place\nyou shall be put into the hands of the English authorities.\"\n\n\"Just what I desire,\" replied the quartermaster.\n\nThereupon he was taken back to the cabin that served as his prison, and\ntwo sailors were stationed at the door, with orders to watch all his\nmovements. The witnesses of this scene retired indignant and in despair.\n\nSince Glenarvan had failed to overcome Ayrton's obstinacy, what was\nto be done? Evidently to follow the plan formed at Eden, of returning\nto England, and resuming hereafter this unsuccessful enterprise, for\nall traces of the Britannia now seemed irrevocably lost. The document\nadmitted of no new interpretation. There was no other country on the\nline of the thirty-seventh parallel, and the only way was to sail for\nhome.\n\nHe consulted his friends, and more especially Captain Mangles, on the\nsubject of return. The captain examined his store-rooms. The supply\nof coal would not last more than fifteen days. It was, therefore,\nnecessary to replenish the fuel at the first port. He accordingly\nproposed to Glenarvan to sail for Talcahuana Bay, where the Duncan had\nalready procured supplies before undertaking her voyage. This was a\ndirect passage. Then the yacht, with ample provisions, could double\nCape Horn, and reach Scotland by way of the Atlantic.\n\nThis plan being adopted, the engineer was ordered to force on steam.\nHalf an hour afterwards the yacht was headed towards Talcahuana, and at\nsix o'clock in the evening the mountains of New Zealand had disappeared\nbeneath the mists of the horizon.\n\n[Sidenote: WOMANLY INFLUENCE.]\n\nIt was a sad return for these brave searchers, who had left the shores\nof Scotland with such hope and confidence. To the joyous cries that\nhad saluted Glenarvan on his return succeeded profound dejection. Each\nconfined himself to the solitude of his cabin, and rarely appeared on\ndeck. All, even the loquacious Paganel, were mournful and silent. If\nGlenarvan spoke of beginning his search again, the geographer shook\nhis head like a man who has no more hope, for he seemed convinced as\nto the fate of the shipwrecked sailors. Yet there was one man on board\nwho could have informed them about this catastrophe, but whose silence\nwas still prolonged. There was no doubt that the rascally Ayrton knew,\nif not the actual situation of the captain, at least the place of the\nshipwreck. Probably Harry Grant, if found, would be a witness against\nhim; hence he persisted in his silence, and was greatly enraged,\nespecially towards the sailors who would accuse him of an evil design.\n\nSeveral times Glenarvan renewed his attempts with the quartermaster.\nPromises and threats were useless. Ayrton's obstinacy was carried\nso far, and was so inexplicable, that the major came to the belief\nthat he knew nothing; which opinion was shared by the geographer and\ncorroborated his own ideas in regard to Captain Grant.\n\nBut if Ayrton knew nothing, why did he not plead his ignorance? It\ncould not turn against him, while his silence increased the difficulty\nof forming a new plan. Ought they to infer the presence of Harry Grant\nin Australia from meeting the quartermaster on that continent? At all\nevents, they must induce Ayrton to explain on this subject.\n\nLady Helena, seeing her husband's failures, now suggested an attempt,\nin her turn, to persuade the quartermaster. Where a man had failed,\nperhaps a woman could succeed by her gentle entreaty. Glenarvan,\nknowing the tact of his young wife, gave his hearty approval. Ayrton\nwas, accordingly, brought to Lady Helena's boudoir. Mary Grant was to\nbe present at the interview, for the young girl's influence might also\nbe great, and Lady Helena would not neglect any chance of success.\n\n[Illustration: For an hour the two ladies were closeted with the\nquartermaster, but nothing resulted from this conference.]\n\nFor an hour the two ladi", "label": "CONTRADICT"}

As for that Benedetto,\nwho so grossly belied his name, have you never made any effort to trace\nout whither he has gone, or what has become of him?”\n\n“No; far from wishing to learn whither he has betaken himself, I should\nshun the possibility of meeting him as I would a wild beast. Thank God,\nI have never heard his name mentioned by any person, and I hope and\nbelieve he is dead.”\n\n“Do not think so, Bertuccio,” replied the count; “for the wicked are\nnot so easily disposed of, for God seems to have them under his special\nwatch-care to make of them instruments of his vengeance.”\n\n“So be it,” responded Bertuccio, “all I ask of heaven is that I may\nnever see him again.

But Valentine was so weak that this recital scarcely produced the\nsame effect it would have done had she been in her usual state of\nhealth. Indeed, her brain was only the seat of vague ideas, and\nconfused forms, mingled with strange fancies, alone presented\nthemselves before her eyes.\n\nDuring the daytime Valentine’s perceptions remained tolerably clear,\nowing to the constant presence of M. Noirtier, who caused himself to be\ncarried to his granddaughter’s room, and watched her with his paternal\ntenderness; Villefort also, on his return from the law courts,\nfrequently passed an hour or two with his father and child.\n\nAt six o’clock Villefort retired to his study, at eight M. d’Avrigny\nhimself arrived, bringing the night draught prepared for the young\ngirl, and then M. Noirtier was carried away. A nurse of the doctor’s\nchoice succeeded them, and never left till about ten or eleven o’clock,\nwhen Valentine was asleep.

He strove to collect a band of\nfollowers, and followed the footsteps of Decesaris and Gasparone, whom\nhe hoped to surpass. Many young men of Palestrina, Frascati, and\nPampinara had disappeared. Their disappearance at first caused much\ndisquietude; but it was soon known that they had joined Cucumetto.\nAfter some time Cucumetto became the object of universal attention; the\nmost extraordinary traits of ferocious daring and brutality were\nrelated of him.\n\n“One day he carried off a young girl, the daughter of a surveyor of\nFrosinone. The bandit’s laws are positive; a young girl belongs first\nto him who carries her off, then the rest draw lots for her, and she is\nabandoned to their brutality until death relieves her sufferings. When\ntheir parents are sufficiently rich to pay a ransom, a messenger is\nsent to negotiate; the prisoner is hostage for the security of the\nmessenger; should the ransom be refused, the prisoner is irrevocably\nlost. The young girl’s lover was in Cucumetto’s troop; his name was\nCarlini. When she recognized her lover, the poor girl extended her arms\nto him, and believed herself safe; but Carlini felt his heart sink, for\nhe but too well knew the fate that awaited her. However, as he was a\nfavorite with Cucumetto, as he had for three years faithfully served\nhim, and as he had saved his life by shooting a dragoon who was about\nto cut him down, he hoped the chief would have pity on him. He took\nCucumetto one side, while the young girl, seated at the foot of a huge\npine that stood in the centre of the forest, made a veil of her\npicturesque head-dress to hide her face from the lascivious gaze of the\nbandits. There he told the chief all—his affection for the prisoner,\ntheir promises of mutual fidelity, and how every night, since he had\nbeen near, they had met in some neighboring ruins.\n\n20109m\n\n\n\n“It so happened that night that Cucumetto had sent Carlini to a\nvillage, so that he had been unable to go to the place of meeting.\nCucumetto had been there, however, by accident, as he said, and had\ncarried the maiden off. Carlini besought his chief to make an exception\nin Rita’s favor, as her father was rich, and could pay a large ransom.\nCucumetto seemed to yield to his friend’s entreaties, and bade him find\na shepherd to send to Rita’s father at Frosinone.\n\n“Carlini flew joyfully to Rita, telling her she was saved, and bidding\nher write to her father, to inform him what had occurred, and that her\nransom was fixed at three hundred piastres. Twelve hours’ delay was all\nthat was granted—that is, until nine the next morning. The instant the\nletter was written, Carlini seized it, and hastened to the plain to\nfind a messenger. He found a young shepherd watching his flock. The\nnatural messengers of the bandits are the shepherds who live between\nthe city and the mountains, between civilized and savage life. The boy\nundertook the commission, promising to be in Frosinone in less than an\nhour. Carlini returned, anxious to see his mistress, and announce the\njoyful intelligence. He found the troop in the glade, supping off the\nprovisions exacted as contributions from the peasants; but his eye\nvainly sought Rita and Cucumetto among them.\n\n“He inquired where they were, and was answered by a burst of laughter.\nA cold perspiration burst from every pore, and his hair stood on end.\nHe repeated his question. One of the bandits rose, and offered him a\nglass filled with Orvietto, saying, ‘To the health of the brave\nCucumetto and the fair Rita.’ At this moment Carlini heard a woman’s\ncry; he divined the truth, seized the glass, broke it across the face\nof him who presented it, and rushed towards the spot whence the cry\ncame. After a hundred yards he turned the corner of the thicket; he\nfound Rita senseless in the arms of Cucumetto. At the sight of Carlini,\nCucumetto rose, a pistol in each hand.

General Quesnel, it appears, had just\nleft a Bonapartist club when he disappeared. An unknown person had been\nwith him that morning, and made an appointment with him in the Rue\nSaint-Jacques; unfortunately, the general’s valet, who was dressing his\nhair at the moment when the stranger entered, heard the street\nmentioned, but did not catch the number.” As the police minister\nrelated this to the king, Villefort, who looked as if his very life\nhung on the speaker’s lips, turned alternately red and pale.

His fear was lest the governor, touched with\npity, might order him to be removed to better quarters, and thus\nseparate him from his young companion. But fortunately this was not the\ncase, and the governor left him, convinced that the poor madman, for\nwhom in his heart he felt a kind of affection, was only troubled with a\nslight indisposition.\n\nDuring this time, Edmond, seated on his bed with his head in his hands,\ntried to collect his scattered thoughts. Faria, since their first\nacquaintance, had been on all points so rational and logical, so\nwonderfully sagacious, in fact, that he could not understand how so\nmuch wisdom on all points could be allied with madness.

Edmond shuddered when he heard\nthe painful efforts which the old man made to drag himself along; his\nleg was inert, and he could no longer make use of one arm. Edmond was\nobliged to assist him, for otherwise he would not have been able to\nenter by the small aperture which led to Dantès’ chamber.\n\n“Here I am, pursuing you remorselessly,” he said with a benignant\nsmile. “You thought to escape my munificence, but it is in vain.

Let us not, therefore, be led astray\nby vain conjectures, but only be certain that Ayrton is Ben Joyce, a\nsailor of the Britannia, now chief of a band of convicts.\"\n\nThe major's explanation was accepted as conclusive.\n\n\"Now,\" replied Glenarvan, \"will you tell me how and why Harry Grant's\nquartermaster is in Australia?\"\n\n\"How, I do not know,\" said MacNabb; \"and the police declare they know\nno more than I on the subject.

Then, smiling, he went and gathered on the banks\nof the stream a few handfuls of wild celery, with which he rubbed the\nboy's body. Under this treatment, performed with an extreme gentleness,\nthe child felt his strength revive, and it was plain that a few hours\nwould suffice to restore him.\n\nIt was therefore decided that that day and the following night should\nbe passed at the encampment. Besides, two important questions remained\nto be settled--food, and means of conveyance. Provisions and mules were\nboth wanting.\n\nFortunately Thalcave solved the difficulty. This guide, who was\naccustomed to conduct travelers along the Patagonian frontiers, and\nwas one of the most intelligent baqueanos of the country, engaged to\nfurnish Glenarvan all that his little party needed. He offered to take\nhim to a \"tolderia\" (encampment) of Indians, about four miles distant,\nwhere they would find everything necessary for the expedition. This\nproposal was made partly by gestures, partly by Spanish words which\nPaganel succeeded in understanding. It was accepted, and Glenarvan and\nhis learned friend, taking leave of their companions, reascended the\nstream under the guidance of the Patagonian.\n\nThey proceeded at a good pace for an hour and a half, taking long\nstrides to keep up to the giant Thalcave. All the region was charming,\nand of a rich fertility. The grassy pastures succeeded each other,\nand could easily have fed thousands of cattle. Large ponds, united by\na winding chain of streams, gave these plains a verdant moisture.\nBlack-headed swans sported on the mirror-like surface, and disputed the\nempire of the waters with numberless ostriches that gamboled over the\nplains, while the brilliant feathered tribes were in wonderful variety.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nJacques Paganel proceeded from admiration to ecstasy. Exclamations\nof delight continually escaped his lips, to the astonishment of the\nPatagonian, who thought it very natural that there should be birds in\nthe air, swans on the lakes, and grass on the prairies. The geographer\nhad no reason to regret his walk, or complain of its length. He\nscarcely believed himself started, or that the encampment would soon\ncome in sight.\n\nThis tolderia was at the bottom of a narrow valley among the mountains.\nHere in huts of branches lived thirty wandering natives, grazing\nlarge herds of milch cows, sheep, cattle and horses. Thus they roamed\nfrom one pasture to another, always finding a repast ready for their\nfour-footed companions.\n\n[Sidenote: GLENARVAN GOING TO MARKET.]\n\nThalcave took upon himself the negotiation, which was not long. In\nreturn for seven small Argentine horses, all saddled, a hundred pounds\nof dried meat, a few measures of rice, and some leathern bottles for\nwater, the Indians received twenty ounces of gold, the value of which\nthey perfectly understood. Glenarvan would have bought another horse\nfor the Patagonian, but he intimated that it was unnecessary.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe bargain concluded, Glenarvan took leave of his new \"providers,\" as\nPaganel expressed it, and returned to the encampment. His arrival was\nwelcomed by cries of joy at sight of the provisions and horses. Every\none ate with avidity. Robert partook of some nourishment; he had almost\nentirely regained his strength, and the remainder of the day was passed\nin perfect rest. Various subjects were alluded to: the absent dear\nones, the Duncan, Captain Mangles, his brave crew, and Harry Grant who\nwas, perhaps, not far distant.\n\nAs for Paganel, he did not leave the Indian. He became Thalcave's\nshadow, and could not remain quiet in the presence of a real\nPatagonian, in comparison with whom he would have passed for a dwarf.\nHe overwhelmed the grave Indian with Spanish phrases, to which the\nlatter quietly listened. The geographer studied this time without a\nbook, and was often heard repeating words aloud.\n\n\"If I do not get the accent,\" said he to the major, \"you must not be\nangry with me.

In these, indeed, he was astonishingly\nclever, and could not have found his superior. When Glenarvan\nquestioned the catapaz about some peculiarity of the country, his\nlearned companion would always anticipate the answer of the guide, who\nthen gazed at him with a look of amazement.\n\nThat same day they met a road which crossed the line that they had\nhitherto pursued.

He believed that the Maoris were sparing them\nthe fatigue of their journey to the English settlements, and that they\nwere certain to arrive at their destination. He was, therefore, quite\nresigned to his lot, and traced on his map the course of the Waikato\nacross the plains and valleys of the province. Lady Helena and Mary\nGrant, suppressing their terror, conversed in low tones with Glenarvan,\nand the most skillful physiognomist could not have detected on their\nfaces the anxiety of their hearts.\n\nThe Waikato River is worshiped by the natives, as Paganel knew, and\nEnglish and German naturalists have never ascended beyond its junction\nwith the Waipa. Whither did Kai-Koumou intend to take his captives?\nThe geographer could not have guessed if the word \"Taupo,\" frequently\nrepeated, had not attracted his attention. By consulting his map,\nhe saw that this name was applied to a celebrated lake in the most\nmountainous part of the island, and that from it the Waikato flows.\n\nPaganel, addressing Captain Mangles in French, so as not to be\nunderstood by the savages, asked him how fast the canoe was going. The\ncaptain thought about three miles an hour.\n\n\"Then,\" replied the geographer, \"if we do not travel during the night,\nour voyage to the lake will last about four days.\"\n\n\"But whereabouts are the English garrisons?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"It is difficult to say,\" replied Paganel. \"At all events, the war\nmust have reached the province of Taranaki, and probably the troops\nare collected beyond the mountains, on the side of the lake where the\nhabitations of the savages are concentrated.\"\n\n\"God grant it!\" said Lady Helena.\n\nGlenarvan cast a sorrowful glance at his young wife and Mary Grant,\nexposed to the mercy of these fierce natives, and captives in a wild\ncountry, far from all human assistance. But he saw that he was watched\nby Kai-Koumou, and, not wishing to show that one of the captives was\nhis wife, he prudently kept his thoughts to himself, and gazed at the\nbanks of the river with apparent indifference.\n\n[Sidenote: ACCESSIONS, AND PROGRESS.]\n\nThe sun was just sinking below the horizon as the canoe ran upon a bank\nof pumice-stones, which the Waikato carries with it from its source\nin the volcanic mountains. Several trees grew here, as if designed to\nshelter an encampment. Kai-Koumou landed his prisoners.\n\nThe men had their hands tied, the ladies were free. All were placed\nin the centre of the encampment, around which large fires formed an\nimpassable barrier.\n\nBefore Kai-Koumou had informed his captives of his intention to\nexchange them, Glenarvan and Captain Mangles had discussed various\nmethods of recovering their liberty. What they could not venture in the\nboat they hoped to attempt on land, at the hour for encamping, under\ncover of the night.\n\nBut since Glenarvan's conversation with the chief, it seemed wise to\nabandon this design. They must be patient. It was the most prudent\nplan. The exchange offered chances that neither an open attack nor a\nflight across these unknown regions could afford. Many circumstances\nmight indeed arise that would delay, and even prevent, such a\ntransaction; but still it was better to await the result. What,\nmoreover, could ten defenceless men do against thirty well-armed\nsavages? Besides, Glenarvan thought it likely that Kai-Koumou's tribe\nhad lost some chief of high rank whom they were particularly anxious to\nrecover; and he was not mistaken.\n\nThe next day the canoe ascended the river with increased swiftness.\nIt stopped for a moment at the junction of a small river which wound\nacross the plains on the right bank.

They were Lord\nGlenarvan and his companions.\n\n[Sidenote: A TESTING TIME.]\n\nThe evening before, the little party, led astray by the dense fog, had\nencamped in the midst of a numerous tribe of natives. About midnight,\nthe travelers, surprised in their sleep, were made prisoners and\ncarried on board the canoe. They had not yet been maltreated, but had\ntried in vain to resist. Their arms and ammunition were in the hands of\nthe savages, and their own bullets would have quickly stretched them on\nthe earth had they attempted to escape.\n\nThey were not long in learning, by the aid of a few English words which\nthe natives used, that, being driven back by the British troops, they\nwere returning, vanquished and weakened, to the regions of the upper\nWaikato. Their chief, after an obstinate resistance, in which he lost\nhis principal warriors, was now on his way to rouse again the river\ntribes. He was called Kai-Koumou, a terrible name, which signified\nin the native language \"he who eats the limbs of his enemy.\" He was\nbrave and bold, but his cruelty equaled his bravery. No pity could be\nexpected from him. His name was well known to the English soldiers, and\na price had been set upon his head by the governor of New Zealand.\n\nThis terrible catastrophe had come upon Glenarvan just as he was\nabout reaching the long-desired harbor of Auckland, whence he would\nhave returned to his native country. Yet, looking at his calm and\npassionless countenance, you could not have divined the depth of his\nanguish, for in his present critical situation he did not betray the\nextent of his misfortunes. He felt that he ought to set an example of\nfortitude to his wife and his companions, as being the husband and\nchief. Moreover, he was ready to die first for the common safety, if\ncircumstances should require it.\n\n[Sidenote: CHIEFS, CIVILIZED AND UNCIVILIZED.]\n\nHis companions were worthy of him; they shared his noble thoughts, and\ntheir calm and haughty appearance would scarcely have intimated that\nthey were being carried away to captivity and suffering.

The three\nhorses galloped briskly forward. These excellent beasts perceived,\ndoubtless, by instinct, whither their masters were guiding them.\nThaouka, especially, showed a spirit that neither fatigue nor thirst\ncould overcome. The other horses followed, at a slower pace, but\nincited by his example.\n\nThe Patagonian frequently turned his head to look at Robert Grant, and,\nseeing the young boy firm and erect, in an easy and graceful position,\ntestified his satisfaction by a word of encouragement.\n\n\"Bravo, Robert!\" said Glenarvan. \"Thalcave seems to congratulate you.\nHe praises you, my boy!\"\n\n\"And why, my lord?\"\n\n\"Because of the way you ride.\"\n\n\"Oh, I merely keep firm; that is all,\" replied Robert, who blushed with\npleasure at hearing himself complimented.\n\n\"That is the main point, Robert,\" said Glenarvan; \"but you are too\nmodest, and I am sure you cannot fail to become an accomplished\nequestrian.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Robert, \"but what will papa say, who wishes to make a\nsailor of me?\"\n\n\"The one does not interfere with the other. If all horsemen do not make\ngood sailors, all sailors may certainly make good horsemen. To ride on\nthe yards, you must learn to keep yourself firm. As for knowing how to\nmanage your horse, that comes more easily.\"\n\n\"Poor father!\" exclaimed Robert; \"how he will thank you when you have\nfound him!\" And, so saying, he took his lordship's hand and pressed it\nto his lips.\n\n\"You love him well, Robert?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord; he was so kind to sister and me. He thought only of us,\nand every voyage brought us a memento of the countries he visited, and,\nwhat was better, tender caresses and kind words, on his return. Ah!\nyou will love him too, when you know him! Mary resembles him. He has a\nsweet voice like her. It is singular for a sailor, is it not?\"\n\n\"Yes, very singular, Robert,\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\"I see him still,\" replied the boy, as if speaking to himself. \"Good\nand brave papa! He rocked me to sleep on his knees, when I was little,\nand kept humming an old Scottish song which is sung around the lakes of\nour country. I sometimes recall the air, but indistinctly. How we loved\nhim, my lord! Well, I think one must be very young to love his father\nwell.\"\n\n\"And old to reverence him, my child,\" replied Glenarvan, quite moved by\nthe words that came from this young heart.\n\nDuring this conversation, their horses had relaxed their pace and\nfallen behind the other; but Thalcave called them, and they resumed\ntheir former gait. It was soon evident, however, that, with the\nexception of Thaouka, the horses could not long maintain this speed. At\nnoon it was necessary to give them an hour's rest.\n\nGlenarvan grew uneasy. The signs of dryness did not diminish, and the\nwant of water might result in disastrous consequences. Thalcave said\nnothing, but probably thought that if the Guamini was dry it would then\nbe time to despair, if indeed an Indian's heart has ever experienced\nsuch an emotion.\n\nThey therefore kept on, and by use of whip and spur the horses were\ninduced to continue their journey, but they could not quicken their\npace. Thalcave might easily have gone ahead, for in a few hours Thaouka\ncould have carried him to the banks of the stream. He doubtless thought\nof it, but probably did not like to leave his two companions alone in\nthe midst of this desert, and, that he might not outstrip them, he\nforced Thaouka to lessen his speed. It was not, however, without much\nresistance, prancing and neighing, that Thalcave's horse consented to\nkeep pace with the others. It was not so much the strength as the voice\nof his master which restrained him; the Indian actually talked to his\nhorse; and the animal, if he did not answer, at least comprehended\nhim.

Glenarvan cast\na rapid glance around him. The crowd opened, and a warrior, dripping\nwith sweat and overcome with fatigue, appeared.\n\nAs soon as Kai-Koumou perceived him, he said in English, evidently that\nhe might be understood by the captives:\n\n\"You come from the camp of the pale-faces?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the Maori.\n\n\"You saw the prisoner, our Tohonga?\"\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n\"Is he living?\"\n\n\"He is dead! The English have shot him.\"\n\nThe fate of Glenarvan and his companions was settled.\n\n\"You shall all die to-morrow at daybreak!\" cried Kai-Koumou.\n\nThe unfortunates were therefore to suffer a common death. Lady Helena\nand Mary Grant raised towards heaven a look of thankfulness.\n\nThe captives were not taken back to the temple. They were to attend\nthat day the funeral of the dead chief, and the bloody ceremonies\nconnected therewith. A party of natives conducted them to the foot of\nan enormous koudi, where these guardians remained without losing sight\nof their prisoners. The rest of the tribe, absorbed in their official\nmourning, seemed to have forgotten them.\n\nThe customary three days had elapsed since the death of Kara-Tété. The\nsoul of the deceased had therefore forever abandoned its mortal abode.\nThe sacred rites began.\n\nThe body was carried to a small mound in the centre of the\nfortification, clothed in splendid costume, and enveloped in a\nmagnificent flaxen mat. The head was adorned with plumes, and wore a\ncrown of green leaves. The face, arms, and breast had been rubbed with\noil, and therefore showed no mortification.\n\nThe parents and friends of the deceased came to the foot of the\nmound, and all at once, as if some director were beating time to a\nfuneral dirge, a great concert of cries, groans, and sobs arose on the\nair. They mourned the dead in plaintive and modulated cadences. His\nrelations struck their heads together; his kinswomen lacerated their\nfaces with their nails, and showed themselves more lavish of blood than\nof tears.

Before\nmy arrival on board, did you intend to stop at Madeira?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\"Well, permit me to profit by the consequences of my unlucky blunder.\nMadeira is an island too well known. Everything has been said and\nwritten about it; and it is, moreover, rapidly declining in point of\ncivilization. If, then, it is all the same to you, let us land at the\nCanaries.\"\n\n\"Very well, at the Canaries,\" replied Glenarvan. \"That will not take us\nout of our way.\"\n\n\"I know it, my dear lord.

Glenarvan, not seeing\nhis ordinary interpreter present, had attempted, but in vain, to\nquestion the Patagonian.

If Captain Grant was a\nprisoner of one of these tribes, had he been carried to the north or\nto the south? This problem harassed Glenarvan. It was advisable at all\nhazards to keep track of the captain.

I shall be only one hundred and eighty leagues\nfrom Lisbon, and will wait there for means of further conveyance.\"\n\n\"Well, Monsieur Paganel,\" said Glenarvan, \"it shall be as you desire;\nand, for my part, I am happy that I can offer you for a few days the\nhospitalities of my vessel. May you not grow weary of our company.\"\n\n\"Oh, my lord,\" exclaimed the geographer, \"I am still too happy in being\nso agreeably disappointed. However, it is a very ludicrous situation\nfor a man who takes passage for India, and is sailing to America.\"\n\nIn spite of this mortifying reflection, Paganel made the best use of a\ndelay that he could not avoid. He showed himself amiable, and even gay;\nhe enchanted the ladies with his good humor, and before the end of the\nday he was the friend of every one. At his request the famous document\nwas shown to him. He studied it carefully, long and minutely. No other\ninterpretation appeared to him possible. Mary Grant and her brother\ninspired him with the liveliest interest. He gave them good hopes. His\nway of distinguishing the events, and the undeniable success that he\npredicted for the Duncan, elicited a smile from the young girl.\n\n[Sidenote: THIS, OR THAT, OR NEITHER.]\n\nAs to Lady Helena, when he learned that she was the daughter of William\nTuffnel, there was an outburst of surprise and admiration. He had known\nher father. What a bold discoverer! How many letters they had exchanged\nwhen the latter was corresponding member of the Society! He it was who\nhad introduced him to M. Malte-Brun. What a meeting! and how much\npleasure to travel with the daughter of such a man! Finally, he asked\nLady Helena's permission to kiss her, to which she consented, although\nit was perhaps a little \"improper.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nTHE GEOGRAPHER'S RESOLUTION.\n\n\nMeanwhile the yacht, favored by the currents, was advancing rapidly\ntowards the equator. In a few days the island of Madeira came in view.\nGlenarvan, faithful to his promise, offered to land his new guest here.\n\n\"My dear lord,\" replied Paganel, \"I will not be formal with you. Before\nmy arrival on board, did you intend to stop at Madeira?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\"Well, permit me to profit by the consequences of my unlucky blunder.\nMadeira is an island too well known. Everything has been said and\nwritten about it; and it is, moreover, rapidly declining in point of\ncivilization. If, then, it is all the same to you, let us land at the\nCanaries.\"\n\n\"Very well, at the Canaries,\" replied Glenarvan. \"That will not take us\nout of our way.\"\n\n\"I know it, my dear lord. At the Canaries, you see, there are three\ngroups to study, not to speak of the Peak of Teneriffe, which I have\nalways desired to see. This is a fine opportunity. I will profit by\nit; and, while waiting for a vessel, will attempt the ascent of this\ncelebrated mountain.\"\n\n\"As you please, my dear Paganel,\" replied Glenarvan, who could not help\nsmiling, and with good reason.\n\nThe Canaries are only a short distance from Madeira, scarcely two\nhundred and fifty miles, a mere trifle for so good a vessel as the\nDuncan.\n\nThe same day, at two o'clock in the afternoon, Captain Mangles and\nPaganel were walking on the deck. The Frenchman pressed his companion\nwith lively questions concerning Chili. All at once the captain\ninterrupted him, and pointing towards the southern horizon, said,--\n\n\"Mr. Paganel!\"\n\n\"My dear captain,\" replied the geographer.\n\n\"Please cast your eyes in", "label": "NEUTRAL"}

We are now in the neighborhood of the\ntrade-winds, which, from October to April, blow from the northeast, and\nour progress will, therefore, be very much retarded.\"\n\n\"But what can we do, captain? If this misfortune occurs, we must submit\nto it. It will only be a delay, after all.\"\n\n\"Probably, if a storm does not come upon us too.\"\n\n\"Do you fear bad weather?\" asked Glenarvan, looking at the sky, which,\nhowever, was cloudless.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the captain. \"I tell your lordship, but would conceal my\napprehensions from Lady Helena and Miss Grant.\"\n\n\"You act wisely. What do you apprehend?\"\n\n\"There are signs of a great storm. Do not trust the appearance of the\nsky, my lord; nothing is more deceptive. For two days the barometer\nhas fallen to an alarming degree. This is a warning that I cannot\ndisregard. I particularly fear the storms of the South Seas, for I have\nbeen already exposed to them.\"\n\n\"John,\" replied Glenarvan, \"the Duncan is a stout vessel, and her\ncaptain a skillful seaman. Let the storm come; we will take care of\nourselves.\"\n\nCaptain Mangles, while giving expression to his fears, was by no means\nforgetful of his duty as a sailor. The steady fall of the barometer\ncaused him to take every measure of precaution. The sky, as yet, gave\nno indication of the approaching tempest; but the warnings of his\ninfallible instrument were not to be disregarded.\n\nThe young captain accordingly remained on deck all night. About eleven\no'clock the sky grew threatening towards the south. All hands were\nimmediately called on deck, to take in the sails. At midnight the wind\nfreshened. The creaking of the masts, the rattling of the rigging,\nand the groaning of bulkheads informed the passengers of the state of\naffairs. Paganel, Glenarvan, the major, and Robert came on deck to\nrender assistance if it should be needed. Over the sky, that they had\nleft clear and studded with stars, now rolled thick clouds broken by\nlight bands and spotted like the skin of a leopard.\n\n\"Has the storm broken upon us?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"Not yet, but it will presently,\" replied the captain.\n\nAt that moment he gave the order to reef the top-sail. The sailors\nsprang into the windward rattlings, and with difficulty accomplished\ntheir task. Captain Mangles wished to keep on as much sail as possible,\nto support the yacht and moderate her rolling. After these precautions\nhad been taken, he told the mate and the boatswain to prepare for the\nassault of the tempest, which could not be long in breaking forth.\nStill, like an officer at the storming of a breach, he did not leave\nthe point of observation, but from the upper deck endeavored to draw\nfrom the stormy sky its secrets.\n\n[Sidenote: AN ADDED CALAMITY.]\n\nIt was now one o'clock in the morning. Lady Helena and Miss Grant,\naroused by the unusual bustle, ventured to come on deck. The wind was\nsharply whistling through the cordage, which, like the strings of a\nmusical instrument, resounded as if some mighty bow had caused their\nrapid vibrations; the pulleys clashed against each other; the ropes\ncreaked with a sharp sound in their rough sockets; the sails cracked\nlike cannon, and vast waves rolled up to assail the yacht, as it\nlightly danced on their foaming crests.\n\nWhen the captain perceived the ladies, he approached and besought them\nto return to the cabin. Several waves had already been shipped, and the\ndeck might be swept at any moment. The din of the elements was now so\npiercing that Lady Helena could scarcely hear the young captain.\n\n\"Is there any danger?\" she managed to ask him during a momentary lull\nin the storm.\n\n\"No, madam,\" replied he; \"but neither you nor Miss Mary can remain on\ndeck.\"\n\nThe ladies did not oppose an order that seemed more like an entreaty,\nand returned to the cabin just as a wave, rolling over the stern,\nshook the compass-lights in their socke", "label": "NEUTRAL"}

We shall pass, that is all, like honest\nmen, over the country and do all the good possible. '_Transire\nbenefaciendo_' is our motto.\"\n\nWith these words the discussion ended. The preparations were begun that\nvery day, and it was resolved to keep the expedition secret, in order\nnot to alarm the Indians. The 14th of October was fixed for the day of\ndeparture.\n\nWhen they came to choose the sailors who were to go, they all offered\ntheir services, and Glenarvan was forced to make a choice. He preferred\nto have them draw lots, that he might not mortify such brave men. This\nwas accordingly done; and the mate, Tom Austin, Wilson, a powerful\nfellow, and Mulready, were the fortunate ones.\n\nLord Glenarvan had displayed great energy in his preparations, for he\nwished to be ready at the day appointed; and he was. Captain Mangles\nlikewise supplied his ship with coal, that he might put to sea at any\nmoment. He wished to gain the Argentine shore before the travelers.\nHence there was a real rivalry between Glenarvan and the captain, which\nwas of advantage to both.\n\nAt last, on the 14th of October, at the time agreed upon, every one was\nready. At the moment of departure the passengers of the yacht assembled\nin the cabin. The Duncan was on the point of starting, and already her\npropeller was agitating the quiet waters of Talcahuana Bay. Glenarvan,\nPaganel, MacNabb, Robert Grant, Tom Austin, Wilson and Mulready, armed\nwith carbines and Colt's revolvers, were preparing to leave the vessel.\nGuides and mules were waiting for them on shore.\n\n\"It is time,\" said Lord Glenarvan at last.\n\n\"Go, then, my husband!\" replied Lady Helena, restraining her emotion.\n\nHe pressed her to his breast, while Robert threw himself upon the neck\nof his sister.\n\n\"And now, dear companions,\" said Jacques Paganel, \"one last clasp of\nthe hand to last us till we reach the shores of the Atlantic.\"\n\nIt was not asking much, but these were clasps which would strengthen\nthe hopes of the worthy geographer.\n\nThey then returned to the deck, and the seven travelers left the\nvessel. They soon reached the wharf, which the yacht approached within\nless than half a cable's length.\n\nLady Helena cried for the last time,--\n\n\"My friends, God help you!\"\n\n\"And he will help us, madam,\" answered Jacques Paganel; \"for, I assure\nyou, we shall help ourselves.\"\n\n\"Forward!\" shouted Captain Mangles to his engineer.\n\n\"_En route_!\" returned Glenarvan; and at the same instant that the\ntravelers, giving reins to their animals, followed the road along the\nshore, the Duncan started again at full speed on the highway of the\nocean.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\nTRAVELING IN CHILI.\n\n\nThe native troop engaged by Glenarvan consisted of three men and a boy.\nThe leader of the muleteers was an Englishman who had lived in the\ncountry for twenty years. His occupation was to let mules to travelers,\nand guide them across the passes of the Andes. Then he consigned them\nto the care of a \"laqueano\" (Argentine guide), who was familiar with\nthe road over the Pampas.\n\n[Sidenote: THE PROCESSION FORMED.]\n\nThis Englishman had not so forgotten his native tongue, in the company\nof mules and Indians, that he could not converse with the travelers.\nHence it was easy for Glenarvan to make known his wishes, and for\nthe muleteer to execute his orders, of which circumstance the former\navailed himself, since Paganel had not yet succeeded in making himself\nunderstood.\n\nThis leader, or \"catapaz,\" in the language of Chili, was assisted by\ntwo native peons and a boy of twelve.

The flag of England fluttered at her yard-arm, while at\nthe top of the mainmast floated a blue pennon, bearing the initials\nE. G., worked in gold and surmounted by a ducal coronet. The yacht\nwas called the Duncan, and belonged to Lord Glenarvan, one of the\nsixteen Scottish peers sitting in the House of Lords, and also a most\ndistinguished member of the \"Royal Thames Yacht Club,\" so celebrated\nthroughout the United Kingdom.\n\nLord Edward Glenarvan was on board with his young wife, Lady Helena", "label": "SUPPORT"}

Villefort fully understood his father’s meaning, and answered\nby a slight shrug of his shoulders. He then motioned to his wife to\ntake leave.\n\n“Now sir,” said Madame de Villefort, “I must bid you farewell. Would\nyou like me to send Edward to you for a short time?”\n\nIt had been agreed that the old man should express his approbation by\nclosing his eyes, his refusal by winking them several times, and if he\nhad some desire or feeling to express, he raised them to heaven. If he\nwanted Valentine, he closed his right eye only, and if Barrois, the\nleft. At Madame de Villefort’s proposition he instantly winked his\neyes.\n\nProvoked by a complete refusal, she bit her lip and said, “Then shall I\nsend Valentine to you?” The old man closed his eyes eagerly, thereby\nintimating that such was his wish.\n\nM. and Madame de Villefort bowed and left the room, giving orders that\nValentine should be summoned to her grandfather’s presence, and feeling\nsure that she would have much to do to restore calmness to the\nperturbed spirit of the invalid. Valentine, with a color still\nheightened by emotion, entered the room just after her parents had\nquitted it. One look was sufficient to tell her that her grandfather\nwas suffering, and that there was much on his mind which he was wishing\nto communicate to her.\n\n“Dear grandpapa,” cried she, “what has happened? They have vexed you,\nand you are angry?”\n\nThe paralytic closed his eyes in token of assent.\n\n“Who has displeased you? Is it my father?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Madame de Villefort?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Me?” The former sign was repeated.\n\n“Are you displeased with me?” cried Valentine in astonishment. M.\nNoirtier again closed his eyes.\n\n“And what have I done, dear grandpapa, that you should be angry with\nme?” cried Valentine.\n\nThere was no answer, and she continued:\n\n“I have not seen you all day. Has anyone been speaking to you against\nme?”\n\n“Yes,” said the old man’s look, with eagerness.\n\n“Let me think a moment. I do assure you, grandpapa—Ah—M. and Madame de\nVillefort have just left this room, have they not?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“And it was they who told you something which made you angry? What was\nit then? May I go and ask them, that I may have the opportunity of\nmaking my peace with you?”\n\n“No, no,” said Noirtier’s look.\n\n“Ah, you frighten me. What can they have said?” and she again tried to\nthink what it could be.\n\n“Ah, I know,” said she, lowering her voice and going close to the old\nman. “They have been speaking of my marriage,—have they not?”\n\n“Yes,” replied the angry look.\n\n“I understand; you are displeased at the silence I have preserved on\nthe subject. The reason of it was, that they had insisted on my keeping\nthe matter a secret, and begged me not to tell you anything of it. They\ndid not even acquaint me with their intentions, and I only discovered\nthem by chance, that is why I have been so reserved with you, dear\ngrandpapa. Pray forgive me.”\n\nBut there was no look calculated to reassure her; all it seemed to say\nwas, “It is not only your reserve which afflicts me.”\n\n“What is it, then?” asked the young girl. “Perhaps you think I shall\nabandon you, dear grandpapa, and that I shall forget you when I am\nmarried?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“They told you, then, that M. d’Épinay consented to our all living\ntogether?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Then why are you still vexed and grieved?” The old man’s eyes beamed\nwith an expression of gentle affection.\n\n“Yes, I understand,” said Valentine; “it is because you love me.” The\nold man assented.\n\n“And you are afraid I shall be unhappy?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“You do not like M.

Then, when this\nis accomplished, how can we sail among the dangerous breakers, and\nin such profound darkness? Moreover, another reason induces me to\nwait. The wind promises to aid us, and I desire to profit by it, and\nam in hopes that it will drift the old hull out when the tide raises\nher. To-morrow, if I am not mistaken, the breeze will blow from the\nnorthwest. We will set the main-sails, and they will help to raise\nthe brig.\"\n\n[Illustration: They therefore anchored, half a cable's length distant,\nin ten fathoms of water.]\n\n\nThese reasons were decisive. Glenarvan and Paganel, the most impatient\non board, yielded, and the work was suspended.\n\nThe night passed favorably, and day appeared. Their captain's\npredictions were realized. The wind blew from the northwest, and\ncontinued to freshen. The crew were summoned. It was nine o'clock. Four\nhours were still to elapse before it would be high water, and that time\nwas not lost. The laborers renewed their efforts with very good success.\n\nMeantime the tide rose. The surface of the sea was agitated into\nripples, and the points of the rocks gradually disappeared, like\nmarine animals returning to their native element. The time for the\nfinal attempt approached. A feverish impatience thrilled all minds.\nNo one spoke. Each gazed at the captain, and awaited his orders. He\nwas leaning over the stern-railing, watching the water, and casting an\nuneasy glance towards the cables.\n\nAt last the tide reached its height. The experiment must now be made\nwithout delay. The main-sails were set, and the mast was bent with the\nforce of the wind.\n\n\"To the windlass!\" cried the captain.\n\nGlenarvan, Mulready, and Robert on one side, and Paganel, the major,\nand Olbinett on the other, bore down upon the handles that moved the\nmachine. At the same time the captain and Wilson added their efforts to\nthose of their companions.\n\n\"Down! down!\" cried the young captain; \"all together!\"\n\nThe cables were stretched taut under the powerful action of the\nwindlass. The anchors held fast, and did not drag. But they must be\nquick, for high tide lasts only a few moments, and the water would not\nbe long in lowering.\n\nThey redoubled their efforts. The wind blew violently, and forced the\nsails against the mast. A few tremors were felt in the hull, and the\nbrig seemed on the point of rising. Perhaps a little more power would\nsuffice to draw her from the sand.\n\n\"Helena! Mary!\" cried Glenarvan.\n\nThe two ladies came and joined their efforts to those of their\ncompanions. A final crack was heard, but that was all! The experiment\nhad failed. The tide was already beginning to ebb, and it was evident\nthat, even with the aid of wind and tide, this insufficient crew could\nnot float their ship.\n\nAs their first plan had failed, it was necessary to have recourse to\nthe second without delay. It was plain that they could not raise the\nMacquarie, and that the only way was to abandon her. To wait on board\nfor the uncertain arrival of assistance would have been folly and\nmadness.\n\nThe captain therefore proposed to construct a raft strong enough to\nconvey the passengers and a sufficient quantity of provisions to the\nNew Zealand coast. It was not a time for discussion, but for action.\nThe work was accordingly begun, and considerably advanced when night\ninterrupted them.\n\nIn the evening, after supper, while Lady Helena and Mary Grant were\nreposing in their berths, Paganel and his friends conversed seriously\nas they paced the deck. The geographer had asked Captain Mangles\nwhether the raft could not follow the coast as far as Auckland, instead\nof landing the passengers at once. The captain replied that it would be\nimpossible with such a rude craft.\n\n\"And could we hav", "label": "NEUTRAL"}

Instead of improving these gifts,\nrarely granted so abundantly, this has been your course—you have given\nyourself up to sloth and drunkenness, and in a fit of intoxication have\nruined your best friend.”\n\n“Help!” cried Caderousse; “I require a surgeon, not a priest; perhaps I\nam not mortally wounded—I may not die; perhaps they can yet save my\nlife.”\n\n“Your wounds are so far mortal that, without the three drops I gave\nyou, you would now be dead. Listen, then.”\n\n“Ah,” murmured Caderousse, “what a strange priest you are; you drive\nthe dying to despair, instead of consoling them.”\n\n“Listen,” continued the abbé. “When you had betrayed your friend, God\nbegan not to strike, but to warn you.

The Hundred Days\n\nM. Noirtier was a true prophet, and things progressed rapidly, as he\nhad predicted. Everyone knows the history of the famous return from\nElba, a return which was unprecedented in the past, and will probably\nremain without a counterpart in the future.\n\nLouis XVIII. made but a faint attempt to parry this unexpected blow;\nthe monarchy he had scarcely reconstructed tottered on its precarious\nfoundation, and at a sign from the emperor the incongruous structure of\nancient prejudices and new ideas fell to the ground. Villefort,\ntherefore, gained nothing save the king’s gratitude (which was rather\nlikely to injure him at the present time) and the cross of the Legion\nof Honor, which he had the prudence not to wear, although M. de Blacas\nhad duly forwarded the brevet.\n\nNapoleon would, doubtless, have deprived Villefort of his office had it\nnot been for Noirtier, who was all powerful at court, and thus the\nGirondin of ’93 and the Senator of 1806 protected him who so lately had\nbeen his protector. All Villefort’s influence barely enabled him to\nstifle the secret Dantès had so nearly divulged. The king’s procureur\nalone was deprived of his office, being suspected of royalism.\n\nHowever, scarcely was the imperial power established—that is, scarcely\nhad the emperor re-entered the Tuileries and begun to issue orders from\nthe closet into which we have introduced our readers,—he found on the\ntable there Louis XVIII.’s half-filled snuff-box,—scarcely had this\noccurred when Marseilles began, in spite of the authorities, to\nrekindle the flames of civil war, always smouldering in the south, and\nit required but little to excite the populace to acts of far greater\nviolence than the shouts and insults with which they assailed the\nroyalists whenever they ventured abroad.\n\n0159m\n\n\n\nOwing to this change, the worthy shipowner became at that moment—we\nwill not say all powerful, because Morrel was a prudent and rather a\ntimid man, so much so, that many of the most zealous partisans of\nBonaparte accused him of “moderation”—but sufficiently influential to\nmake a demand in favor of Dantès.\n\nVillefort retained his place, but his marriage was put off until a more\nfavorable opportunity. If the emperor remained on the throne, Gérard\nrequired a different alliance to aid his career; if Louis XVIII.\nreturned, the influence of M. de Saint-Méran, like his own, could be\nvastly increased, and the marriage be still more suitable. The deputy\nprocureur was, therefore, the first magistrate of Marseilles, when one\nmorning his door opened, and M. Morrel was announced.\n\nAnyone else would have hastened to receive him; but Villefort was a man\nof ability, and he knew this would be a sign of weakness. He made\nMorrel wait in the antechamber, although he had no one with him, for\nthe simple reason that the king’s procureur always makes everyone wait,\nand after passing a quarter of an hour in reading the papers, he\nordered M. Morrel to be admitted.\n\nMorrel expected Villefort would be dejected; he found him as he had\nfound him six weeks before, calm, firm, and full of that glacial\npoliteness, that most insurmountable barrier which separates the\nwell-bred from the vulgar man.\n\nHe had entered Villefort’s office expecting that the magistrate would\ntremble at the sight of him; on the contrary, he felt a cold shudder\nall over him when he saw Villefort sitting there with his elbow on his\ndesk, and his head leaning on his hand. He stopped at the door;\nVillefort gazed at him as if he had some difficulty in recognizing him;\nthen, after a brief interval, during which the honest shipowner turned\nhis hat in his hands,\n\n“M. Morrel, I believe?” said Villefort.\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“Come nearer,” said the magistrate, with a patronizing wave of the\nhand, “and tell me to what circumstance I owe the honor of this visit.”\n\n“Do you not guess, monsieur?” asked Morrel.\n\n“Not in the least; but if I can serve you in any way I shall be\ndelighted.”\n", "label": "CONTRADICT"}

What,\nmoreover, could ten defenceless men do against thirty well-armed\nsavages? Besides, Glenarvan thought it likely that Kai-Koumou's tribe\nhad lost some chief of high rank whom they were particularly anxious to\nrecover; and he was not mistaken.\n\nThe next day the canoe ascended the river with increased swiftness.\nIt stopped for a moment at the junction of a small river which wound\nacross the plains on the right bank. Here another canoe, with ten\nnatives on board, joined Kai-Koumou. The warriors merely exchanged\nsalutations, and then continued their course. The new-comers had\nrecently fought against the English troops, as could be seen by their\ntattered garments, their gory weapons, and the wounds that still bled\nbeneath their rags. They were gloomy and taciturn, and, with the\nindifference common to all savage races, paid no attention to the\ncaptives.\n\nTowards evening Kai-Koumou landed at the foot of the mountains,\nwhose nearer ridges reached precipitously to the river-bank. Here\ntwenty natives, who had disembarked from their canoes, were making\npreparations for the night. Fires blazed beneath the trees. A chief,\nequal in rank to Kai-Koumou, advanced with measured pace, and, rubbing\nhis nose against that of the latter, saluted him cordially. The\nprisoners were stationed in the centre of the encampment, and guarded\nwith extreme vigilance.\n\nThe next morning the ascent of the Waikato was resumed. Other boats\ncame from various affluents of the river. Sixty warriors, evidently\nfugitives from the last insurrection, had now assembled, and were\nreturning, more or less wounded in the fray, to the mountain districts.\nSometimes a song arose from the canoes, as they advanced in single\nfile. One native struck up the patriotic ode of the mysterious \"Pihé,\"\nthe national hymn that calls the Maoris to battle. The full and\nsonorous voice of the singer waked the echoes of the mountains; and\nafter each stanza his comrades struck their breasts, and sang the\nwarlike verses in chorus. Then they seized their oars again, and the\ncanoes were headed up stream.\n\nDuring the day a singular sight enlivened the voyage. About four\no'clock the canoe, without lessening its speed, guided by the steady\nhand of the chief, dashed through a narrow gorge. Eddies broke\nviolently against numerous small islands, which rendered navigation\nexceeding dangerous. Never could it be more hazardous to capsize, for\nthe banks afforded no refuge, and whoever had set foot on the porous\ncrust of the shore would probably have perished. At this point the\nriver flowed between warm springs, oxide of iron colored the muddy\nground a brilliant red, and not a yard of firm earth could be seen.\nThe air was heavy with a penetrating sulphureous odor. The natives did\nnot regard it, but the captives were seriously annoyed by the noxious\nvapors exhaled from the fissures of the soil and the bubbles that\nburst and discharged their gaseous contents. Yet, however disagreeable\nthese emanations were, the eye could not but admire this magnificent\nspectacle.\n\n[Illustration: At this point the river flowed between warm springs, and\nnot a yard of firm earth could be seen.]\n\nThe canoes soon after entered a dense cloud of white smoke, whose\nwreaths rose in gradually decreasing circles above the river. On the\nshores a hundred geysers, some shooting forth masses of vapor, and\nothers overflowing in liquid columns, varied their effects, like the\njets and cascades of a fountain. It seemed as though some engineer was\ndirecting at his pleasure the outflowings of these springs, as the\nwaters and vapor, mingling in the air, formed rainbows in the sunbeams.\n\nFor two miles the canoes glided within this vapory atmosphere,\nenveloped in its warm waves that rolled along the surface of the water.\nThen the sulphureous smoke disappeared, and a pure swift current of\nfresh air refreshed the panting voyagers.

Valentine promised all that Morrel required of\nher, and certainly it was less difficult now for her to believe that\nshe should marry Maximilian than it was an hour ago to assure herself\nthat she should not marry Franz.\n\nDuring the time occupied by the interview we have just detailed, Madame\nde Villefort had gone to visit M. Noirtier. The old man looked at her\nwith that stern and forbidding expression with which he was accustomed\nto receive her.\n\n“Sir,” said she, “it is superfluous for me to tell you that Valentine’s\nmarriage is broken off, since it was here that the affair was\nconcluded.”\n\nNoirtier’s countenance remained immovable.\n\n“But one thing I can tell you, of which I do not think you are aware;\nthat is, that I have always been opposed to this marriage, and that the\ncontract was entered into entirely without my consent or approbation.”\n\nNoirtier regarded his daughter-in-law with the look of a man desiring\nan explanation.\n\n“Now that this marriage, which I know you so much disliked, is done\naway with, I come to you on an errand which neither M. de Villefort nor\nValentine could consistently undertake.”\n\nNoirtier’s eyes demanded the nature of her mission.\n\n“I come to entreat you, sir,” continued Madame de Villefort, “as the\nonly one who has the right of doing so, inasmuch as I am the only one\nwho will receive no personal benefit from the transaction,—I come to\nentreat you to restore, not your love, for that she has always\npossessed, but to restore your fortune to your granddaughter.”\n\nThere was a doubtful expression in Noirtier’s eyes; he was evidently\ntrying to discover the motive of this proceeding, and he could not\nsucceed in doing so.\n\n“May I hope, sir,” said Madame de Villefort, “that your intentions\naccord with my request?”\n\nNoirtier made a sign that they did.\n\n“In that case, sir,” rejoined Madame de Villefort, “I will leave you\noverwhelmed with gratitude and happiness at your prompt acquiescence to\nmy wishes.” She then bowed to M. Noirtier and retired.\n\nThe next day M. Noirtier sent for the notary; the first will was torn\nup and a second made, in which he left the whole of his fortune to\nValentine, on condition that she should never be separated from him. It\nwas then generally reported that Mademoiselle de Villefort, the heiress\nof the marquis and marchioness of Saint-Méran, had regained the good\ngraces of her grandfather, and that she would ultimately be in\npossession of an income of 300,000 livres.\n\nWhile all the proceedings relative to the dissolution of the\nmarriage-contract were being carried on at the house of M. de\nVillefort, Monte Cristo had paid his visit to the Count of Morcerf,\nwho, in order to lose no time in responding to M. Danglars’ wishes, and\nat the same time to pay all due deference to his position in society,\ndonned his uniform of lieutenant-general, which he ornamented with all\nhis crosses, and thus attired, ordered his finest horses and drove to\nthe Rue de la Chaussée d’Antin.\n\nDanglars was balancing his monthly accounts, and it was perhaps not the\nmost favorable moment for finding him in his best humor. At the first\nsight of his old friend, Danglars assumed his majestic air, and settled\nhimself in his easy-chair.\n\nMorcerf, usually so stiff and formal, accosted the banker in an affable\nand smiling manner, and, feeling sure that the overture he was about to\nmake would be well received, he did not consider it necessary to adopt\nany manœuvres in order to gain his end, but went at once straight to\nthe point.\n\n40086m", "label": "CONTRADICT"}

Clear sky, swift-flitting\nboats, and brilliant sunshine disappeared; the heavens were hung with\nblack, and the gigantic structure of the Château d’If seemed like the\nphantom of a mortal enemy. As they reached the shore, the count\ninstinctively shrunk to the extreme end of the boat, and the owner was\nobliged to call out, in his sweetest tone of voice:\n\n“Sir, we are at the landing.”\n\nMonte Cristo remembered that on that very spot, on the same rock, he\nhad been violently dragged by the guards, who forced him to ascend the\nslope at the points of their bayonets. The journey had seemed very long\nto Dantès, but Monte Cristo found it equally short. Each stroke of the\noar seemed to awaken a new throng of ideas, which sprang up with the\nflying spray of the sea.\n\n50219m\n\n\n\nThere had been no prisoners confined in the Château d’If since the\nrevolution of July; it was only inhabited by a guard, kept there for\nthe prevention of smuggling. A concierge waited at the door to exhibit\nto visitors this monument of curiosity, once a scene of terror.\n\nThe count inquired whether any of the ancient jailers were still there;\nbut they had all been pensioned, or had passed on to some other\nemployment. The concierge who attended him had only been there since\n1830. He visited his own dungeon. He again beheld the dull light vainly\nendeavoring to penetrate the narrow opening. His eyes rested upon the\nspot where had stood his bed, since then removed, and behind the bed\nthe new stones indicated where the breach made by the Abbé Faria had\nbeen. Monte Cristo felt his limbs tremble; he seated himself upon a log\nof wood.\n\n“Are there any stories connected with this prison besides the one\nrelating to the poisoning of Mirabeau?” asked the count; “are there any\ntraditions respecting these dismal abodes,—in which it is difficult to\nbelieve men can ever have imprisoned their fellow-creatures?”\n\n“Yes, sir; indeed, the jailer Antoine told me one connected with this\nvery dungeon.”\n\nMonte Cristo shuddered; Antoine had been his jailer. He had almost\nforgotten his name and face, but at the mention of the name he recalled\nhis person as he used to see it, the face encircled by a beard, wearing\nthe brown jacket, the bunch of keys, the jingling of which he still\nseemed to hear. The count turned around, and fancied he saw him in the\ncorridor, rendered still darker by the torch carried by the concierge.\n\n“Would you like to hear the story, sir?”\n\n“Yes; relate it,” said Monte Cristo, pressing his hand to his heart to\nstill its violent beatings; he felt afraid of hearing his own history.\n\n“This dungeon,” said the concierge, “was, it appears, some time ago\noccupied by a very dangerous prisoner, the more so since he was full of\nindustry. Another person was confined in the Château at the same time,\nbut he was not wicked, he was only a poor mad priest.”\n\n“Ah, indeed?—mad!” repeated Monte Cristo; “and what was his mania?”\n\n“He offered millions to anyone who would set him at liberty.”\n\nMonte Cristo raised his eyes, but he could not see the heavens; there\nwas a stone veil between him and the firmament. He thought that there\nhad been no less thick a veil before the eyes of those to whom Faria\noffered the treasures.\n\n“Could the prisoners see each other?” he asked.\n\n“Oh, no, sir, it was expressly forbidden; but they eluded the vigilance\nof the guards, and made a passage from one dungeon to the other.”\n\n“And which of them made this passage?”\n\n“Oh, it must have been the young man, certainly, for he was strong and\nindustrious, while the abbé was aged and weak; besides, his mind was\ntoo vacillating to allow him to carry out an idea.”\n\n“Blind fools!” murmured the count.\n\n“However, be that as it may, the young man made a tunnel, how or by\nwhat means no one knows; but he made it, and there is the evidence yet\nremaining of his work.

The mystery of the Duncan's\npresence there was solved; and the travelers, so miraculously saved,\nthought only of revisiting their comfortable cabins and partaking of a\ngood breakfast.\n\nHowever, leaving Lady Helena, Mary Grant, the major, Paganel, and\nRobert to enter the saloon, Glenarvan and Captain Mangles retained Tom\nAustin with them. They wished to question him further.\n\n\"Now, Tom,\" said Glenarvan, \"let me know: did not this order to sail\nfor the coast of New Zealand seem strange to you?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord,\" replied Austin. \"I was very much surprised; but, as I\nam not in the habit of discussing the orders I receive, I obeyed. Could\nI act otherwise? If any accident had happened from not following your\ninstructions, should I not have been to blame? Would you have done\ndifferently, captain?\"\n\n\"No, Tom,\" answered Captain Mangles.\n\n\"But what did you think?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"I thought, my lord, that, in the cause of Captain Grant, it was\nnecessary to go wherever you directed me; that by some combination of\ncircumstances another vessel would take you to New Zealand, and that\nI was to wait for you on the eastern coast of the island. Moreover,\non leaving Melbourne, I kept my destination secret, and the crew did\nnot know it till we were out at sea and the shores of Australia had\ndisappeared from sight. But then an incident occurred that perplexed me\nvery much.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, Tom?\" inquired Glenarvan.\n\n\"I mean,\" he replied, \"that when the quartermaster, Ayrton, learned,\nthe day after our departure, the Duncan's destination----\"\n\n\"Ayrton!\" cried Glenarvan. \"Is he on board?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord.\"\n\n\"Ayrton here!\" repeated Glenarvan, glancing at Captain Mangles.\n\n\"Wonderful indeed!\" said the young captain.\n\nIn an instant, with the swiftness of lightning, Ayrton's conduct, his\nlong-contrived treachery, Glenarvan's wound, the attack upon Mulready,\ntheir suffer", "label": "NEUTRAL"}

No sign\nof disease, however, could be detected. The animals were in perfect\nhealth, and bravely endured the hardships of the journey. Glenarvan,\ntherefore, was inclined to think that this mysterious epidemic would\nhave no more victims. This was Ayrton's opinion too, who declared that\nhe could not at all understand the cause of the frightful mortality.\n\nThey started again, and the cart served to convey the pedestrians, who\nrode in it by turns. At evening, after a journey of only ten miles, the\nsignal to halt was given, the encampment arranged, and the night was\npassed comfortably beneath a large group of arborescent ferns, among\nwhose branches fluttered enormous bats.\n\nThe next day they made an excellent beginning, and accomplished fifteen\nmiles. Everything led them to hope that they would encamp that evening\non the banks of the Snowy River. Evening came, and a fog, clearly\ndefined against the horizon, marked the course of the long-looked-for\nstream. A forest of tall trees was seen at a bend in the road, behind\na moderate elevation. Ayrton guided his oxen towards the tall trunks\ndimly discerned in the shadow, and was just passing the boundary of the\nwood, when the cart sank into the earth to the hubs.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" asked Glenarvan, when he perceived that the cart\nhad come to a stop.\n\n\"We are fast in the mud,\" replied Ayrton.\n\nHe urged his oxen with voice and whip, but they were up to their knees\nin the mire, and could not stir.\n\n\"Let us encamp here,\" said Captain Mangles.\n\n\"That is the best plan,\" answered Ayrton. \"To-morrow, at daybreak, we\ncan see to extricate ourselves.\"\n\n[Illustration: Early in the afternoon they passed through a curious\nforest of ferns.

The air was heavy with stifling mists. Flashes\nof lightning, the dazzling forerunners of a coming storm, every now and\nthen illumined the horizon.\n\nThe beds were prepared, and the sunken cart was made as comfortable as\npossible. The sombre arch of the great trees sheltered the tent of the\ntravelers. Provided no rain fell, they would have no reason to complain.\n\nAyrton succeeded with difficulty in extricating his three oxen from\nthe mud, in which they had by this time sunk to their flanks. The\nquartermaster picketed them with the four horses, and would allow no\none to give them their fodder. This service he performed himself with\ngreat exactness, and that evening Glenarvan observed that his care was\nredoubled, for which he thanked him, as the preservation of the team\nwas of paramount importance.\n\nMeantime, the travelers partook of a hasty supper. Fatigue and heat had\ndriven away hunger, and they needed rest more than nourishment. Lady\nHelena and Miss Grant, wishing their companions good-night, retired to\ntheir accustomed bedroom. As for the men, some crawled under the tent,\nwhile others stretched themselves on the thick grass at the foot of the\ntrees.\n\nGradually each sank into a heavy sleep. The darkness increased beneath\nthe curtain of dense clouds that covered the sky. Not a breath of\nair was felt. The silence of the night was only interrupted by the\noccasional howlings of wild animals.\n\nAbout eleven o'clock, after an uneasy slumber, the major awoke.

The Patagonian took two steps forward;\nGlenarvan took his hand, and pressed it. There was in the latter's\nlook, in his physiognomy, such a feeling, such an expression of\ngratitude, that the native could not mistake it.

Those whom the fiery flood had not reached fled,\nand ascended the surrounding hills, turning and gazing back at\nthis terrific phenomenon, with which their god, in his wrath, had\noverwhelmed the desecrators of the sacred mountain; while at certain\nmoments they were heard howling their consecratory cry:\n\n\"Taboo! taboo! taboo!\"\n\n[Illustration: The fugitives made themselves levers out of the stakes\nof the tomb.]\n\n[Illustration: An incandescent column poured forth towards the sky with\nloud explosions, while streams of boiling water and lava rolled towards\nthe encampment of the natives.]\n\nMeantime an enormous quantity of vapor, melted stones, and lava had\nescaped from the crater. It was no longer a simple geyser. All this\nvolcanic effervescence had hitherto been confined beneath the crust of\nthe peak, since the outlets of Tangariro sufficed for its expansion;\nbut as a new opening had been made, it had rushed forth with extreme\nviolence.\n\nAll night long, during the storm that raged above and below, the peak\nwas shaken with a commotion that could not but alarm Glenarvan. The\nprisoners, concealed behind the palisade of the tomb, watched the\nfearful progress of the outbreak.\n\nMorning came. The fury of the volcano had not moderated. Thick,\nyellowish vapors mingled with the flames, and torrents of lava poured\nin every direction. Glenarvan, with eye alert and beating heart,\nglanced between the interstices of the inclosure, and surveyed the camp\nof the Maoris.\n\nThe natives had fled to the neighboring plateaus, beyond the reach of\nthe volcano. Several corpses, lying at the foot of the peak, had been\ncharred by the fire. Farther on, towards the pah, the lava had consumed\na number of huts, that were still smoking. The savages, in scattered\ngroups, were gazing at the vapory summit of Maunganamu with religious\nawe.\n\nKai-Koumou came into the midst of his warriors, and Glenarvan\nrecognized him. The chief advanced to the base of the peak, on the side\nspared by the eruption, but did not cross the first slopes. Here, with\noutstretched arms, like a sorcerer exorcising, he made a few grimaces,\nthe meaning of which did not escape the prisoners. As Paganel had\nforeseen, Kai-Koumou was invoking upon the mountain a more rigorous\ntaboo.\n\nSoon after, the natives descended, in single file, the winding paths\nthat led towards the pah.\n\n[Sidenote: A WEARY WAITING.]\n\n\"They are going!\" cried Glenarvan. \"They are abandoning their post!\nGod be thanked!

They kept always to the right of their line of\ndescent, sounding the smallest fissures, descending to the bottom of\nprecipices half filled with fragments of the mass; and more than one\ncame forth with his garments in shreds, his feet and hands lacerated,\nat the peril of his life.\n\n[Sidenote: A SLEEPLESS NIGHT.]\n\nAll this portion of the Andes, except a few inaccessible plateaus,\nwas carefully explored for many hours without one of these brave men\nthinking of rest.

The former was a prey to the most\nviolent grief. He scarcely spoke, and from his lips issued only these\nwords, broken by sighs,--\"I will not go; I will not go!\"\n\nEach understood this determination, and respected it.\n\n\"We will wait,\" said Paganel to the major and Tom Austin. \"Let us take\nsome rest, and recruit our strength.

He\nhopes: but what does he hope?\"\n\n\"God knows!\" said Tom Austin.\n\n\"Poor Robert!\" replied Paganel, wiping his eyes.\n\nTrees thronged the valley in great numbers. The major chose a group of\nlofty carob-trees, under which was established a temporary encampment.\nA few blankets, the arms, a little dried meat, and some rice, was\nall that remained to the travelers. A stream, which flowed not far\noff, furnished water, still muddy from the effects of the avalanche.\nMulready kindled a fire on the grass, and soon presented to his master\na warm and comforting repast. But Glenarvan refused it, and remained\nstretched on his poncho in profound prostration.\n\nThus the day passed. Night came, clear and calm as the preceding. While\nhis companions lay motionless, although wakeful, Glenarvan reascended\nthe mountain. He listened closely, still hoping that a last cry might\nreach him. He ventured alone and afar, pressing his ear to the ground,\nlistening, restraining the beatings of his heart, and calling in a\nvoice of despair.\n\nThe whole night long he wandered on the mountain. Sometimes Paganel,\nsometimes the major, followed him, ready to help him on the slippery\nsummits, or on the edge of the chasms, where his rashness led him. But\nhis last efforts were fruitless; and to the cry of \"Robert! Robert!\" a\nthousand times repeated, echo alone replied.\n\nDay dawned, and it was necessary to go in search of Glenarvan on\nthe mountain, and bring him in spite of his reluctance back to the\nencampment. His despair was terrible. Who would now dare to speak\nto him of departure, and propose leaving this fatal valley? But the\nprovisions were failing. They would soon meet the Argentine guides\nand horses to take them across the Pampas. To retrace their steps was\nmore difficult than to advance. Besides, the Atlantic was the place\nappointed to meet the Duncan.

A malicious smile passed\nover his face; but he almost instantly repressed it, and replied, in a\nvoice which he could scarcely control:\n\n\"Do you hope, then, to deceive Kai-Koumou by false words, cursed\nEuropean? Do you think that Kai-Koumou's eyes cannot read your heart?\"\n\nThen, pointing to Lady Helena, he said:\n\n\"That is your wife!\"\n\n\"No, mine!\" cried Kara-Tété.\n\nThen, pushing back the prisoners, the chief laid his hand on Lady\nHelena's shoulder, who grew pale at the touch.\n\n\"Edward!\" cried the unfortunate woman, in terror.\n\nGlenarvan, without uttering a word, raised his arm.

They worked vigorously, and the boat ascended the\ncurrent of the Waikato with remarkable swiftness.\n\nIn the centre of this long canoe, with feet tied, but hands free, were\nten European prisoners clinging closely to each other. They were Lord\nGlenarvan and his companions.\n\n[Sidenote: A TESTING TIME.]\n\nThe evening before, the little party, led astray by the dense fog, had\nencamped in the midst of a numerous tribe of natives. About midnight,\nthe travelers, surprised in their sleep, were made prisoners and\ncarried on board the canoe. They had not yet been maltreated, but had\ntried in vain to resist. Their arms and ammunition were in the hands of\nthe savages, and their own bullets would have quickly stretched them on\nthe earth had they attempted to escape.\n\nThey were not long in learning, by the aid of a few English words which\nthe natives used, that, being driven back by the British troops, they\nwere returning, vanquished and weakened, to the regions of the upper\nWaikato. Their chief, after an obstinate resistance, in which he lost\nhis principal warriors, was now on his way to rouse again the river\ntribes. He was called Kai-Koumou, a terrible name, which signified\nin the native language \"he who eats the limbs of his enemy.\" He was\nbrave and bold, but his cruelty equaled his bravery. No pity could be\nexpected from him. His name was well known to the English soldiers, and\na price had been set upon his head by the governor of New Zealand.\n\nThis terrible catastrophe had come upon Glenarvan just as he was\nabout reaching the long-desired harbor of Auckland, whence he would\nhave returned to his native country. Yet, looking at his calm and\npassionless countenance, you could not have divined the depth of his\nanguish, for in his present critical situation he did not betray the\nextent of his misfortunes. He felt that he ought to set an example of\nfortitude to his wife and his companions, as being the husband and\nchief. Moreover, he was ready to die first for the common safety, if\ncircumstances should require it.\n\n[Sidenote: CHIEFS, CIVILIZED AND UNCIVILIZED.]\n\nHis companions were worthy of him; they shared his noble thoughts, and\ntheir calm and haughty appearance would scarcely have intimated that\nthey were being carried away to captivity and suffering. By common\nconsent, at Glenarvan's suggestion, they had resolved to feign a proud\nindifference in the presence of the savages. It was the only way of\ninfluencing those fierce natures.\n\n[Illustration: A boat might have been seen ascending the Waikato. It\nwas a canoe seventy feet long and five broad.]\n\nSince leaving the encampment, the natives, taciturn like all savages,\nhad scarcely spoken to each other. However, from a few words exchanged,\nGlenarvan perceived that they were acquainted with the English\nlanguage. He therefore resolved to question the chief in regard to the\nfate that was in store for them. Addressing Kai-Koumou, he said, in a\nfearless tone:\n\n\"Where are you taking us, chief?\"\n\nKai-Koumou gazed at him coldly without answering.\n\n\"Say, what do you expect to do with us?\" continued Glenarvan.\n\nThe chief's eyes blazed with a sudden light, and in a stern voice he\nreplied:\n\n\"To exchange you, if your friends will ransom you; to kill you, if they\nrefuse.\"\n\nGlenarvan asked no more, but hope returned to his heart. Doubtless,\nsome chiefs of the Maori tribe had fallen into the hands of the\nEnglish, and the natives would attempt to recover them by way of\nexchange; their situation, therefore, was not one for despair.\n\nMeantime the canoe rapidly ascended the river.

Let what may remain of revolutionary sap\nexhaust itself and die away with the old trunk, and condescend only to\nregard the young shoot which has started up at a distance from the\nparent tree, without having the power, any more than the wish, to\nseparate entirely from the stock from which it sprung.”\n\n“Bravo, Villefort!” cried the marquis; “excellently well said! Come,\nnow, I have hopes of obtaining what I have been for years endeavoring\nto persuade the marquise to promise; namely, a perfect amnesty and\nforgetfulness of the past.”\n\n“With all my heart,” replied the marquise; “let the past be forever\nforgotten. I promise you it affords _me_ as little pleasure to revive\nit as it does you. All I ask is, that Villefort will be firm and\ninflexible for the future in his political principles. Remember, also,\nVillefort, that we have pledged ourselves to his majesty for your\nfealty and strict loyalty, and that at our recommendation the king\nconsented to forget the past, as I do” (and here she extended to him\nher hand)—“as I now do at your entreaty. But bear in mind, that should\nthere fall in your way anyone guilty of conspiring against the\ngovernment, you will be so much the more bound to visit the offence\nwith rigorous punishment, as it is known you belong to a suspected\nfamily.”\n\n“Alas, madame,” returned Villefort, “my profession, as well as the\ntimes in which we live, compels me to be severe. I have already\nsuccessfully conducted several public prosecutions, and brought the\noffenders to merited punishment. But we have not done with the thing\nyet.”\n\n0087m\n\n\n\n“Do you, indeed, think so?” inquired the marquise.\n\n“I am, at least, fearful of it. Napoleon, in the Island of Elba, is too\nnear France, and his proximity keeps up the hopes of his partisans.\nMarseilles is filled with half-pay officers, who are daily, under one\nfrivolous pretext or other, getting up quarrels with the royalists;\nfrom hence arise continual and fatal duels among the higher classes of\npersons, and assassinations in the lower.”\n\n“You have heard, perhaps,” said the Comte de Salvieux, one of M. de\nSaint-Méran’s oldest friends, and chamberlain to the Comte d’Artois,\n“that the Holy Alliance purpose removing him from thence?”\n\n“Yes; they were talking about it when we left Paris,” said M. de\nSaint-Méran; “and where is it decided to transfer him?”\n\n“To Saint Helena.”\n\n“For heaven’s sake, where is that?” asked the marquise.\n\n“An island situated on the other side of the equator, at least two\nthousand leagues from here,” replied the count.\n\n“So much the better. As Villefort observes, it is a great act of folly\nto have left such a man between Corsica, where he was born, and Naples,\nof which his brother-in-law is king, and face to face with Italy, the\nsovereignty of which he coveted for his son.”\n\n“Unfortunately,” said Villefort, “there are the treaties of 1814, and\nwe cannot molest Napoleon without breaking those compacts.”\n\n“Oh, well, we", "label": "SUPPORT"}

It was difficult to persuade Paganel and Robert--who kept\ntogether--to come on, in order that they might not leave Ayrton and\nMulready too long in suspense. Now the Frenchman would see just the key\nthat he needed to understand a point not before clear to him; anon you\nmight see him as in the illustration, when he had picked up a pebble\nand was sure that it was in itself so interesting as a mineralogical\nspecimen that he must treasure it up for the Bank of France, so that\nhis own land might have at least one part of Australia. All this was\ndone with such a mingling of childish good-nature and scientific and\nnational pride that it was useless to do anything but laugh, and an\nirrepressible smile came over even the major's features. At length,\nhowever, by drawing him into a lecture, they succeeded in persuading\nhim to follow them; and, as they left the diggings, he told them the\nhistory of the prophecies, the discovery, and the spread of knowledge\nas to the rich auriferous deposits of this part of Australia. He\ncould give them facts and incidents and dates as to the ingress into\nMelbourne, and the exodus therefrom to the diggings, in the year 1852;\nhe told them how the energy and the love of order which characterize\nthe English-speaking peoples had reduced to system, method,\nsubordination, the chaotic surgings and restlessness which marked the\nfirst weeks and months of this new era; and he detailed, as though\nhe had studied the subject to the entire neglect of other matters,\nthe working of the system,--how the land was registered, what was the\nsum paid in the aggregate, how the taxes were collected, wherein the\nsystem had been found faulty.

The worthy geographer almost fell backwards. \"A rough little\ngentleman,\" said he; \"I will teach him geography.\" As Captain Mangles\nhad engaged to make him a sailor, Glenarvan a man of honor, the major a\nboy of coolness, Lady Helena a noble and generous being, and Mary Grant\na pupil grateful towards such patrons, Robert was evidently to become\none day an accomplished gentleman.\n\nThe Duncan soon finished shipping her coal, and then leaving these\ngloomy regions she gained the current from the southeast coast of\nBrazil, and, after crossing the equator with a fine breeze from the\nnorth, she entered the southern hemisphere. The passage was effected\nwithout difficulty, and every one had good hopes. On this voyage in\nsearch of Captain Grant, the probabilities increased every day. Their\ncaptain was one of the most confident on board; but his confidence\nproceeded especially from the desire that he cherished so strongly at\nheart, of seeing Miss Mary happy and consoled. He was particularly\ninterested in this young girl; and this feeling he concealed so well,\nthat, except Miss Grant and himself, no one on board the Duncan had\nperceived it.\n\nAs for the learned geographer, he was probably the happiest man in the\nsouthern hemisphere. He passed his time in studying the maps with which\nhe covered the cabin-table; and then followed daily discussions with\nMr. Olbinett, so that he could scarcely set the table.\n\nBut Paganel had all the passengers on his side except the major,\nwho was very indifferent to geographical questions, especially at\ndinner-time. Having discovered a whole cargo of odd books in the mate's\nchests, and among them a number of Cervantes' works, the Frenchman\nresolved to learn Spanish, which nobody on board knew, and which would\nfacilitate his search on the shores of Chili. Thanks to his love for\nphilology, he did not despair of speaking this new tongue fluently on\narriving at Concepcion. He therefore studied assiduously, and was heard\nincessantly muttering heterogeneous syllables. During his leisure hours\nhe did not fail to give young Robert practical instruction, and taught\nhim the history of the country they were rapidly approaching.\n\nIn the meantime the Duncan was proceeding at a remarkable rate. She\ncut the Tropic of Capricorn, and her prow was headed toward the strait\nof the celebrated geographer. Now and then the low shores of Patagonia\nwere seen, but like an almost invisible line on the horizon.

The poor beasts, feeling\ntheir strength renewed, rushed forward with an irresistible eagerness.\nIn a few moments they had reached the Guamini River, and, saddled as\nthey were, plunged to their breasts into the cooling stream.

The major was a man of fifty, of calm,\nregular features, who did as he was bid; of an excellent and superior\ncharacter, modest, taciturn, peaceable, and mild; always agreeing\nwith anything or any one, disputing nothing, and neither contradicting\nhimself nor exaggerating. He would mount with measured step the\nstaircase to his bed-chamber, even were a cannon-ball behind him; and\nprobably to his dying day would never find an opportunity to fly into a\npassion.\n\nThis man possessed, in a high degree, not only the common courage of\nthe battle-field (that physical bravery due only to nervous strength),\nbut, better still, moral courage, that is to say, firmness of soul. If\nhe had a fault, it was that of being absolutely Scotch from head to\nfoot, a pure-blooded Caledonian, an infatuated observer of the ancient\ncustoms of his country. Through his relationship to the Glenarvans he\nlived at Malcolm Castle; and as major and military man it was very\nnatural that he should be found on board the Duncan.\n\nSuch, then, were the passengers of this yacht, summoned by unforeseen\ncircumstances to accomplish one of the most surprising voyages of\nmodern times. Since her arrival at the wharf at Glasgow, she had\nmonopolized the public attention. A considerable number came every day\nto visit her. They were interested in her alone, and spoke only of her,\nto the great umbrage of the other captains of the port, among others\nCaptain Burton, commanding the Scotia, a magnificent steamer, moored\nbeside the Duncan, and bound for Calcutta. The Scotia, from her size,\nhad a right to consider the Duncan as a mere fly-boat. Nevertheless,\nall the attraction centred in Lord Glenarvan's yacht, and increased\nfrom day to day.\n\nThe time of departure approached. Captain Mangles had shown himself\nskillful and expeditious. A month after her trial trip in the Frith of\nClyde, the Duncan, laden, provisioned, and equipped, was ready to put\nto sea. The 25th of August was appointed for the time of departure,\nwhich would enable the yacht to reach the southern latitudes by the\nbeginning of spring. Lord Glenarvan, when his plan was matured, did\nnot neglect to make investigations into the hardships and perils of the\nvoyage; yet he did not hesitate on this account, but prepared to leave\nMalcolm Castle.\n\nOn the 24th of August, Lord and Lady Glenarvan, Major MacNabb, Mary and\nRobert Grant, Mr. Olbinett, the steward of the yacht, and his wife, who\nwas in the service of Lady Glenarvan, left the castle, after taking an\naffectionate farewell of their family servants. Several hours afterward\nthey found themselves on board. Many of the population of Glasgow\nwelcomed with sympathetic admiration the young and courageous lady who\nrenounced the pleasures of a life of luxury, and sailed to the rescue\nof the shipwrecked sailors.\n\nThe apartments of Lord Glenarvan and his wife occupied the entire stern\nof the vessel. They consisted of two bed-chambers, a parlor, and two\ndressing-rooms, adjoining which was an open square inclosed by six\ncabins, five of which were occupied by Mary and Robert Grant, Mr. and\nMrs. Olbinett, and Major MacNabb.

During the scene of\ntumult, Andrea had turned his smiling face towards the assembly; then,\nleaning with one hand on the oaken rail of the dock, in the most\ngraceful attitude possible, he said:\n\n“Gentlemen, I assure you I had no idea of insulting the court, or of\nmaking a useless disturbance in the presence of this honorable\nassembly. They ask my age; I tell it. They ask where I was born; I\nanswer. They ask my name, I cannot give it, since my parents abandoned\nme. But though I cannot give my own name, not possessing one, I can\ntell them my father’s. Now I repeat, my father is named M. de\nVillefort, and I am ready to prove it.”\n\nThere was an energy, a conviction, and a sincerity in the manner of the\nyoung man, which silenced the tumult. All eyes were turned for a moment\ntowards the procureur, who sat as motionless as though a thunderbolt\nhad changed him into a corpse.\n\n“Gentlemen,” said Andrea, commanding silence by his voice and manner;\n“I owe you the proofs and explanations of what I have said.”\n\n“But,” said the irritated president, “you called yourself Benedetto,\ndeclared yourself an orphan, and claimed Corsica as your country.”\n\n“I said anything I pleased, in order that the solemn declaration I have\njust made should not be withheld, which otherwise would certainly have\nbeen the case. I now repeat that I was born at Auteuil on the night of\nthe 27th of September, 1817, and that I am the son of the procureur, M.\nde Villefort. Do you wish for any further details? I will give them. I\nwas born in No. 28, Rue de la Fontaine, in a room hung with red damask;\nmy father took me in his arms, telling my mother I was dead, wrapped me\nin a napkin marked with an H and an N, and carried me into a garden,\nwhere he buried me alive.”\n\nA shudder ran through the assembly when they saw that the confidence of\nthe prisoner increased in proportion to the terror of M. de Villefort.\n\n“But how have you become acquainted with all these details?” asked the\npresident.\n\n“I will tell you, Mr. President. A man who had sworn vengeance against\nmy father, and had long watched his opportunity to kill him, had\nintroduced himself that night into the garden in which my father buried\nme.

In this valley were\nmagnificent gardens planted by Hassen-ben-Sabah, and in these gardens\nisolated pavilions. Into these pavilions he admitted the elect, and\nthere, says Marco Polo, gave them to eat a certain herb, which\ntransported them to Paradise, in the midst of ever-blooming shrubs,\never-ripe fruit, and ever-lovely virgins. What these happy persons took\nfor reality was but a dream; but it was a dream so soft, so voluptuous,\nso enthralling, that they sold themselves body and soul to him who gave\nit to them, and obedient to his orders as to those of a deity, struck\ndown the designated victim, died in torture without a murmur, believing\nthat the death they underwent was but a quick transition to that life\nof delights of which the holy herb, now before you, had given them a\nslight foretaste.”\n\n“Then,” cried Franz, “it is hashish!

Like everything else, we must habituate the senses to a\nfresh impression, gentle or violent, sad or joyous. There is a struggle\nin nature against this divine substance,—in nature which is not made\nfor joy and clings to pain. Nature subdued must yield in the combat,\nthe dream must succeed to reality, and then the dream reigns supreme,\nthen the dream becomes life, and life becomes the dream. But what\nchanges occur!

It was not, however, without much\nresistance, prancing and neighing, that Thalcave's horse consented to\nkeep pace with the others. It was not so much the strength as the voice\nof his master which restrained him; the Indian actually talked to his\nhorse; and the animal, if he did not answer, at least comprehended\nhim. The Patagonian must have used excellent arguments, for, after\n\"discussing\" some time, Thaouka yielded, and obeyed his master's\ncommands.\n\n[Sidenote: GAINED AT LAST.]\n\nBut, if Thaouka understood Thalcave, Thalcave had none the less\nunderstood Thaouka. The intelligent animal, through his superior\ninstincts, had perceived a moisture in the air. He inhaled it eagerly,\nand kept moving his tongue, as if it were steeped in a grateful liquid.\nThe Patagonian could not be deceived; water was not far distant.\n\nHe therefore encouraged his companions by explaining the impatience of\nhis horse, which the others were not long in understanding. They made a\nfinal effort, and galloped after the Indian.\n\nAbout three o'clock a bright line appeared in a hollow of the plain. It\ntrembled under the rays of the sun.\n\n\"Water!\" cried Glenarvan.\n\n\"Water, yes, water!\" cried Robert.\n\nThey had no more need to urge their horses. The poor beasts, feeling\ntheir strength renewed, rushed forward with an irresistible eagerness.\nIn a few moments they had reached the Guamini River, and, saddled as\nthey were, plunged to their breasts into the cooling stream. Their\nmasters imitated their example, without reluctance, and took an\nafternoon bath which was as healthful as it was pleasant.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Ah, how good it is!\" said Robert, as he quenched his thirst in the\nmiddle of the river.\n\n\"Be moderate, my boy,\" said Glenarvan, who did not set a good example.\n\nNothing was heard but the sound of rapid drinking. As for Thalcave,\nhe drank quietly, without hurrying, long and deeply, till they might\nperhaps fear that the stream would be drained.\n\n\"Well,\" said Glenarvan, \"our friends will not be disappointed in their\nexpectations.

He had very fortunately found on the banks of the river a\n\"ramada,\" a kind of inclosure designed for a cattle-fold and shut in\non three sides. The situation was excellent for the purpose, so long\nas one did not fear to sleep in the open air; and that was the least\nanxiety of Thalcave's companions. Thus they did not seek a better\nretreat, but stretched themselves on the ground in the sun to dry their\nwater-soaked garments.\n\n\"Well, since here is shelter,\" said Glenarvan, \"let us think of supper.\nOur friends must be satisfied with the couriers whom they have sent\nforward; and, if I am not greatly mistaken, they will have no reason\nto complain.

What,\nmoreover, could ten defenceless men do against thirty well-armed\nsavages? Besides, Glenarvan thought it likely that Kai-Koumou's tribe\nhad lost some chief of high rank whom they were particularly anxious to\nrecover; and he was not mistaken.\n\nThe next day the canoe ascended the river with increased swiftness.\nIt stopped for a moment at the junction of a small river which wound\nacross the plains on the right bank. Here another canoe, with ten\nnatives on board, joined Kai-Koumou. The warriors merely exchanged\nsalutations, and then continued their course. The new-comers had\nrecently fought against the English troops, as could be seen by their\ntattered garments, their gory weapons, and the wounds that still bled\nbeneath their rags. They were gloomy and taciturn, and, with the\nindifference common to all savage races, paid no attention to the\ncaptives.\n\nTowards evening Kai-Koumou landed at the foot of the mountains,\nwhose nearer ridges reached precipitously to the river-bank. Here\ntwenty natives, who had disembarked from their canoes, were making\npreparations for the night. Fires blazed beneath the trees. A chief,\nequal in rank to Kai-Koumou, advanced with measured pace, and, rubbing\nhis nose against that of the latter, saluted him cordially. The\nprisoners were stationed in the centre of the encampment, and guarded\nwith extreme vigilance.\n\nThe next morning the ascent of the Waikato was resumed. Other boats\ncame from various affluents of the river. Sixty warriors, evidently\nfugitives from the last insurrection, had now assembled, and were\nreturning, more or less wounded in the fray, to the mountain districts.\nSometimes a song arose from the canoes, as they advanced in single\nfile. One native struck up the patriotic ode of the mysterious \"Pihé,\"\nthe national hymn that calls the Maoris to battle. The full and\nsonorous voice of the singer waked the echoes of the mountains; and\nafter each stanza his comrades struck their breasts, and sang the\nwarlike verses in chorus. Then they seized their oars again, and the\ncanoes were headed up stream.\n\nDuring the day a singular sight enlivened the voyage. About four\no'clock the canoe, without lessening its speed, guided by the steady\nhand of the chief, dashed through a narrow gorge. Eddies broke\nviolently against numerous small islands, which rendered navigation\nexceeding dangerous. Never could it be more hazardous to capsize, for\nthe banks afforded no refuge, and whoever had set foot on the porous\ncrust of the shore would probably have perished. At this point the\nriver flowed between warm springs, oxide of iron colored the muddy\nground a brilliant red, and not a yard of firm earth could be seen.\nThe air was heavy with a penetrating sulphureous odor. The natives did\nnot regard it, but the captives were seriously annoyed by the noxious\nvapors exhaled from the fissures of the soil and the bubbles that\nburst and discharged their gaseous contents. Yet, however disagreeable\nthese emanations were, the eye could not but admire this magnificent\nspectacle.\n\n[Illustration: At this point the river flowed between warm springs, and\nnot a yard of firm earth could be seen.]\n\nThe canoes soon after entered a dense cloud of white smoke, whose\nwreaths rose in gradually decreasing circles above the river. On the\nshores a hundred geysers, some shooting forth masses of vapor, and\nothers overflowing in liquid columns, varied their effects, like the\njets and cascades of a fountain. It seemed as though some engineer was\ndirecting at his pleasure the outflowings of these springs, as the\nwaters and vapor, mingling in the air, formed rainbows in the sunbeams.\n\nFor two miles the canoes glided within this vapory atmosphere,\nenveloped in its warm waves that rolled along the surface of the water.\nThen the sulphureous smoke disappeared, and a pure swift current of\nfresh air refreshed the panting voyagers.

Pepe is only seven years old, and is already biting\nhis cartridge!\"\n\nPepe, hearing himself complimented, joined his two little feet, and\npresented arms with perfect precision.\n\n\"He will do!\" added the sergeant. \"He will be a major--or\nbrigadier-general one day!\"\n\nThis story lasted a quarter of an hour, to Thalcave's great\nastonishment. The Indian could not understand how so many words could\ncome from a single throat. No one interrupted the commander; and even\na French sergeant had to conclude at last, though not without forcing\nhis guests to accompany him to his dwelling. Here they were introduced\nto Madame Ipharaguerre, who appeared to be \"a good-looking person,\" if\nthis expression may be employed in regard to an Indian.\n\nWhen he had exhausted himself, the sergeant asked his guests to what he\nowed the honor of their visit. And now it was their turn to explain.\n\nPaganel, opening the conversation in French, told him of their journey\nacross the Pampas, and ended by asking why the Indians had abandoned\nthe country.\n\n\"War!\" replied the sergeant.\n\n\"War?\"\n\n\"Yes, civil war.\"\n\n\"Civil war?\" rejoined Paganel.\n\n\"Yes, war between Paraguay and Buenos Ayres,\" answered the sergeant.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Why, all the Indians of the north are in the rear of General Flores,\nand those of the plains are plundering.\"\n\n\"But the caziques?\"\n\n\"The caziques with them.\"\n\nThis answer was reported to Thalcave, who shook his head. Indeed,\nhe either did not know, or had forgotten, that a civil war, which\nwas afterwards to involve Brazil, was decimating two-thirds of the\nrepublic. The Indians had everything to gain in these internal\nstruggles, and could not neglect such fine opportunities for plunder.\nThe sergeant, therefore, was not mistaken in attributing this desertion\nof the Pampas to the civil war that was being waged in the northern\npart of the Argentine Provinces.\n\nBut this event disconcerted Glenarvan's hopes. If Captain Grant was\na prisoner of the caziques, he must have been carried by them to the\nnorthern frontiers. Yet how and where to find him? Must they attempt\na perilous and almost useless search to the northern limits of the\nPampas? It was a serious matter, which was to be earnestly considered.\n\nHowever, one important question was still to be asked of the sergeant,\nand the major thought of this, while his companions were looking at\neach other in silence.\n\n\"Hav", "label": "NEUTRAL"}

These facts, proved already by the precise details given\nby Ayrton, are still further corroborated by the conversation of the\nconvicts that I have related. Let us not, therefore, be led astray\nby vain conjectures, but only be certain that Ayrton is Ben Joyce, a\nsailor of the Britannia, now chief of a band of convicts.\"\n\nThe major's explanation was accepted as conclusive.\n\n\"Now,\" replied Glenarvan, \"will you tell me how and why Harry Grant's\nquartermaster is in Australia?\"\n\n\"How, I do not know,\" said MacNabb; \"and the police declare they know\nno more than I on the subject.

Chance threw us in his way. He heard Glenarvan's story of the\nshipwreck, and, like a bold man, he promptly decided to take part in\nthe expedition. At the Wimerra he communicated with one of his friends,\nthe farrier of Black Point, and thus left distinguishable traces of\nour course. His band followed us. A poisonous plant enabled him to\ngradually kill our oxen and horses. Then, at the proper moment, he\nentangled us in the marshes of the Snowy, and surrendered us to the\nconvicts he commanded.\"\n\nEverything possible had been said concerning Ben Joyce. His past had\njust been reviewed by the major, and the wretch appeared as he was,--a\nbold and formidable criminal. His intentions had been clearly proved,\nand required, on the part of Glenarvan, extreme vigilance. Fortunately,\nthere was less to fear from the detected bandit than the secret traitor.\n\nBut one serious fact appeared from this explanation. No one had yet\nthought of it; only Mary Grant, disregarding the past, looked forward\nto the future. Captain Mangles first saw her pale and disconsolate. He\nunderstood what was passing in her mind.\n\n\"Miss Mary!\" cried he, \"you are weeping!\"\n\n\"What is the matter, my child?\" asked Lady Helena.\n\n\"My father, madam, my father!\" replied the young girl.\n\nShe could not continue.

It is Maria Theresa.\"\n\n\"Certainly, Mr. Paganel,\" replied Harry Grant; \"Maria Theresa on the\nEnglish and German, but Tabor on the French maps.\"\n\nAt this moment a vigorous blow descended upon Paganel's shoulder. Truth\ncompels us to say that it was from the major, who now failed in his\nstrict habits of propriety.\n\n\"A fine geographer you are!\" said MacNabb, in a tone of badinage. \"But\nno matter, since we have succeeded.\"\n\n\"No matter?\" cried Paganel; \"I ought never to have forgotten that\ntwofold appellation! It is an unpardonable mistake, unworthy of the\nsecretary of a Geographical Society. I am disgraced!\"\n\nWhen the meal was finished, Harry Grant put everything in order in his\nhouse. He took nothing away, for he was willing that the guilty convict\nshould inherit his possessions.\n\nThey returned to the vessel; and, as he expected to sail the same day,\nGlenarvan gave orders for the quartermaster's landing. Ayrton was\nbrought on deck, and found himself in the presence of Harry Grant.\n\n\"It is I, Ayrton,\" said he.\n\n\"Yes, captain,\" replied Ayrton, without betraying any astonishment at\nHarry Grant's appearance. \"Well, I am not sorry to see you again in\ngood health.\"\n\n[Illustration: The passengers could see the quartermaster, with folded\narms, standing motionless as a statue, on a rock, and gazing at the\nvessel.]\n\n\"It seems, Ayrton, that I made a mistake in landing you on an inhabited\ncoast.\"\n\n\"It seems so, captain.\"\n\n\"You will take my place on this desert island. May Heaven lead you to\nrepentance!\"\n\n\"May it be so,\" rejoined Ayrton, in a calm tone.\n\nThen Glenarvan, addressing the quartermaster, said:\n\n\"Do you still adhere, Ayrton, to this determination to be abandoned?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord.\"\n\n\"Does Tabor Island suit you?\"\n\n\"Perfectly.\"\n\n\"Now listen to my last words.

I know where you are, and will never forget you.\"\n\n\"Thank you, my lord!\" replied Ayrton, simply.\n\nSuch were the last words exchanged between Glenarvan and the\nquartermaster. The boat was ready, and Ayrton embarked. Captain Mangles\nhad previously sent to the island several cases of preserved food, some\nclothes, tools, weapons, and a supply of powder and shot.

But Valentine was so weak that this recital scarcely produced the\nsame effect it would have done had she been in her usual state of\nhealth. Indeed, her brain was only the seat of vague ideas, and\nconfused forms, mingled with strange fancies, alone presented\nthemselves before her eyes.\n\nDuring the daytime Valentine’s perceptions remained tolerably clear,\nowing to the constant presence of M. Noirtier, who caused himself to be\ncarried to his granddaughter’s room, and watched her with his paternal\ntenderness; Villefort also, on his return from the law courts,\nfrequently passed an hour or two with his father and child.\n\nAt six o’clock Villefort retired to his study, at eight M. d’Avrigny\nhimself arrived, bringing the night draught prepared for the young\ngirl, and then M. Noirtier was carried away. A nurse of the doctor’s\nchoice succeeded them, and never left till about ten or eleven o’clock,\nwhen Valentine was asleep. As she went downstairs she gave the keys of\nValentine’s room to M. de Villefort, so that no one could reach the\nsick-room excepting through that of Madame de Villefort and little\nEdward.\n\nEvery morning Morrel called on Noirtier to receive news of Valentine,\nand, extraordinary as it seemed, each day found him less uneasy.\nCertainly, though Valentine still labored under dreadful nervous\nexcitement, she was better; and moreover, Monte Cristo had told him\nwhen, half distracted, he had rushed to the count’s house, that if she\nwere not dead in two hours she would be saved.

Masses of vapor, generated by the high temperature\nof the preceding days, condensed into thick clouds and threatened to\ndissolve in showers of rain. Moreover, the proximity of the Atlantic,\nand the west wind, which here reigns supreme, rendered the climate of\nthis region peculiarly moist. However, for that day at least the heavy\nclouds did not break; and at evening the horses, after traveling forty\nmiles, halted on the edge of a deep \"cañada,\" an immense natural ditch\nfilled with water. A shelter was wanting, but the ponchos served for\ntents as well as clothing, and peaceful slumbers enwrapped all.\n\nThe next day, as they progressed farther, the presence of subterranean\nstreams betrayed itself more noticeably, and moisture was seen in every\ndepression of the ground. Soon they came to large ponds, some already\ndeep and others just forming. So long as there were only lagoons, the\nhorses could easily extricate themselves; but with these treacherous\nswamps it was more difficult. Tall grass obstructed them, and it was\nnecessary to incur the danger before it could be understood.

I\nshould like very well to have some of the seed.\"\n\n\"But he speaks seriously,\" said the major.\n\n\"Yes, major, you shall see.\"\n\nRobert was not mistaken, and soon they found themselves before a vast\nfield of horns, regularly planted.\n\n\"Well?\" said Robert.\n\n\"This is something singular,\" replied Paganel, turning towards the\nIndian with a questioning look.\n\n[Sidenote: AN ANXIOUS INDIAN.]\n\n\"The horns come from the ground,\" explained Thalcave; \"and the cattle\nare under it.\"\n\n\"What!\" cried Paganel, \"is there a whole drove in this mire?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered the Patagonian.\n\nIn fact, a vast herd had perished in this bog, which had given way\nbeneath them. Hundreds of cattle had thus met their death, side by\nside, by suffocation in this vast quagmire. This circumstance, which\nsometimes takes place on the plains, could not be ignored by the\nIndian, and it was a warning which it was proper to heed. They passed\naround this immense hecatomb, which would have satisfied the most\nexacting gods of antiquity; and an hour after the field of horns was\nfar behind.\n\nThalcave now began to observe with an anxious air the state of things\naround him.

The geographer was accordingly requested to interrogate\nthe Indian, which he did at once. Thalcave replied that he was\nastonished to see the plain so soaked with moisture.

Glenarvan, accordingly, put the horses into the stable of a\n\"fonda;\" and Paganel, the major, Robert, and he, under the guidance of\nThalcave, proceeded towards Fort Independence.\n\nAfter ascending the ridges of the mountains for a short time, they\narrived at the postern, rather carelessly guarded by a native sentinel.\nThey passed without difficulty, and inferred either great negligence or\nextreme security. A few soldiers were exercising on the parade-ground\nof the fort, the oldest of whom was not more than twenty and the\nyoungest scarcely ten. In fact, they were a dozen young children and\nboys who were drilling very nicely. Their uniform consisted of a\nstriped shirt confined at the waist by a leathern girdle. The mildness\nof the climate justified this light costume. Each of these young\nsoldiers carried a gun and a sword, which were too long and heavy for\nthe little fellows. All had a certain family resemblance, and the\ncorporal who commanded resembled them too: they were twelve brothers,\nwho were parading under the orders of the thirteenth.\n\n[Sidenote: AN ARGENTINE COMMANDANT.]\n\nPaganel was not astonished. He remembered his Argentine statistics, and\nknew that in this country the average number of children in a family\nexceeds nine. But what surprised him exceedingly was to see these\nlittle soldiers practicing the French tactics, and to hear the orders\nof the corporal given in his own native language.\n\n\"This is singular,\" said he.\n\nBut Glenarvan had not come to see boys drill, still less to occupy\nhimself with their nationality or relationship. He did not, therefore,\ngive Paganel time to express further astonishment, but besought him\nto ask for the commander of the fortress. Paganel did so, and one of\nthe soldiers proceeded towards a small building which served as the\nbarracks.\n\nA few moments after, the commander appeared in person. He was a man\nof fifty, robust, with a military air, thick whiskers, prominent\ncheek-bones, gray hair, and commanding look, so far as one could judge\nthrough the clouds of smoke that issued from his short pipe.\n\nThalcave, addressing him, introduced Lord Glenarvan and his companions.\nWhile he spoke, the commander kept scrutinizing Paganel with quite\nembarrassing persistence. The geographer did not know what the trooper\nmeant, and was about to ask him, when the latter unceremoniously seized\nhis hand, and said, in a joyous tone, in his own language,--\n\n\"A Frenchman?\"\n\n\"Yes, a Frenchman,\" replied Paganel.\n\n\"Ah, I am delighted! Welcome, welcome! I am almost a Frenchman,\"\ncried the commander, shaking the geographer's arm with rather painful\nviolence.\n\n\"One of your friends?\" asked the major of Paganel.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied he, with national pride; \"we have friends in all parts\nof the world!\"\n\n[Illustration: \"Ah, I am delighted!

But he gave\nthem a more lengthy and extended narrative of Captain Cook's voyages,\nwhich were the most important in their results as well as the most\ninteresting and tragic in many of their incidents. It was on the 6th\nof October, 1769, that this navigator first landed on the shores which\nhe visited twice afterwards, and each time added greatly to the stock\nof previous knowledge concerning these islands, their productions, and\ntheir inhabitants. By him it was first ascertained that cannibalism was\npracticed by some, if not all, of the tribes at that time; and it was\nvery evident, from the manner of Paganel's narration, that hereabout\nlay the extremely sensitive point of the worthy geographer's fears and\nforebodings. However, he was not deterred from rehearsing how one and\nanother not merely visited, but began to settle, on the island, so that\nin the treaty of 1814 it was formally recognized as belonging to Great\nBritain, and twenty years after was important enough to have a separate\nofficial and governmental establishment.\n\nPaganel also told, at great length, the tales of many of the sad\nincidents which from time to time have marked even the commercial\nintercourse between the European and the Maori; as, for instance, the\nsad tale of conflict and bloodshed connected with the death of Captain\nMarion, a French navigator, in 1772. He had landed near the spot where\nSurville had ill-treated some of the natives and traitorously seized\na son of the chief, Takouri, who yet appeared to welcome this next\nFrench visitant, though remembering none the less the terrible duty of\nvengeance which is felt by the Maori to be so binding.\n\n[Illustration: It was on the sixth of October, 1769, that this\nnavigator (Captain Cook) first landed on the shores.]\n\nFor a long time the cloak of friendship was worn by the natives, the\nmore thoroughly to lull the suspicions of the whites, and to entice a\nlarger number on shore; in which endeavor they succeeded only too well.\nThe French ships being greatly out of repair, Marion was induced to\nfell timber at some distance in the interior, and to establish in this\noccupation a great number of his men, going frequently to them, and\nremaining with them and the apparently friendly chiefs. On one of these\noccasions the Maoris fulfilled their revengeful project with a terrible\nsatisfaction to themselves. Only one man, of all those in the interior,\nmanaged to escape, the commander himself falling a prey to their\nvengeance. They then endeavored to kill the second in command, who,\nwith several others, was nearer to the shore. These, of course, at once\nstarted for their boats; breathless, they reached them, hotly pursued\nto the water's edge by the insatiate savages. Then, safe themselves,\nthe French marksmen picked off the chief, and the previous exultation\nof the aborigines was, even in the hour of their triumph, turned to\nlamentation, coupled with wonder at the terrible power of the white\nman's fire-barrel.\n\n[Illustration: Safe themselves, the French marksmen picked off the\nchief.]\n\nAll this and much more did the geographer narrate; but it must be\nconfessed that he neither spoke, nor did they listen, with the\ncomplacency evinced in his previous", "label": "NEUTRAL"}

The forests of\nOceanica are entirely different from those of the New World, and the\neucalyptus--the \"tara\" of the aborigines--is the most perfect tree of\nthe Australian flora.\n\nThe shade is not dense, nor the darkness profound, beneath these domes\nof verdure, owing to a strange peculiarity in the arrangement of the\nleaves of the eucalyptus. Not one presents its face to the sun, but\nonly its sharp edge. The eye sees nothing but profiles in this singular\nfoliage. Thus the rays of the sun glide to the earth as if they had\npassed between the slats of a window-blind.\n\nEvery one observed this and seemed surprised. Why this particular\narrangement? This question was naturally addressed to Paganel, who\nreplied like a man who is never at fault.\n\n\"What astonishes me,\" said he, \"is not the freak of nature, for she\nknows what she does; but botanists do not always know what they say.\nNature was not mistaken in giving to these trees this singular foliage;\nbut men are wrong in calling them eucalyptuses.\"\n\n\"What does the word mean?\" asked Mary Grant.\n\n\"It comes from the Greek words [Greek: eu kalyptô], signifying _I cover\nwell_. But you all see that the eucalyptus covers badly.\"\n\n[Sidenote: A SILENT MARCH.]\n\n\"Just so, my dear Paganel,\" replied Glenarvan; \"and now tell us why the\nleaves grow thus.\"\n\n\"In this country, where the air is dry,\" said Paganel, \"where rains\nare rare and the soil is parched, the trees need neither wind nor\nsun. Hence these narrow leaves seek to defend themselves against the\nelements and preserve themselves from too great an evaporation. They\ntherefore present their edges, and not their faces, to the action of\nthe solar rays. There is nothing more intelligent than a leaf.\"\n\n\"Nor more selfish,\" remarked the major. \"They thought only of\nthemselves, and not at all of travelers.\"\n\nThe entire party was inclined to be of MacNabb's opinion, except\nPaganel, who, as he wiped his face, congratulated himself upon\ntraveling beneath these shadowless trees. However, this arrangement of\nfoliage was to be regretted; for the journey through these forests is\nfrequently very long and painful, since nothing protects the traveler\nfrom the heat of the sun.\n\nAll day long our travelers pursued their way under these interminable\narches. They met neither quadruped nor human being. A few cockatoos\ninhabited the tops of the trees; but at that height they could scarcely\nbe distinguished, and their chattering was an almost inaudible murmur.\nSometimes a flock of parrots would shoot across a distant vista,\nillumining it with a rapid flash of variegated light. But generally a\ndeep silence reigned in this vast temple of verdure, and the measured\ntread of the horses, a few words exchanged now and then in desultory\nconversation, the creaking of the cart-wheels, and from time to time a\ncry from Ayrton as he urged on his sluggish team, were the only sounds\nthat disturbed this vast solitude.\n\n[Illustration: They were like so many columns exactly mated, and could\nbe counted by hundreds.]\n\nAt evening they encamped at the foot of some trees that bore the marks\nof a recent fire.

Marseilles—The Arrival\n\nOn the 24th of February, 1815, the look-out at Notre-Dame de la Garde\nsignalled the three-master, the _Pharaon_ from Smyrna, Trieste, and\nNaples.\n\nAs usual, a pilot put off immediately, and rounding the Château d’If,\ngot on board the vessel between Cape Morgiou and Rion island.\n\nImmediately, and according to custom, the ramparts of Fort Saint-Jean\nwere covered with spectators; it is always an event at Marseilles for a\nship to come into port, especially when this ship, like the _Pharaon_,\nhas been built, rigged, and laden at the old Phocee docks, and belongs\nto an owner of the city.\n\nThe ship drew on and had safely passed the strait, which some volcanic\nshock has made between the Calasareigne and Jaros islands; had doubled\nPomègue, and approached the harbor under topsails, jib, and spanker,\nbut so slowly and sedately that the idlers, with that instinct which is\nthe forerunner of evil, asked one another what misfortune could have\nhappened on board. However, those experienced in navigation saw plainly\nthat if any accident had occurred, it was not to the vessel herself,\nfor she bore down with all the evidence of being skilfully handled, the\nanchor a-cockbill, the jib-boom guys already eased off, and standing by\nthe side of the pilot, who was steering the _Pharaon_ towards the\nnarrow entrance of the inner port, was a young man, who, with activity\nand vigilant eye, watched every motion of the ship, and repeated each\ndirection of the pilot.\n\nThe vague disquietude which prevailed among the spectators had so much\naffected one of the crowd that he did not await the arrival of the\nvessel in harbor, but jumping into a small skiff, desired to be pulled\nalongside the _Pharaon_, which he reached as she rounded into La\nRéserve basin.\n\nWhen the young man on board saw this person approach, he left his\nstation by the pilot, and, hat in hand, leaned over the ship’s\nbulwarks.\n\nHe was a fine, tall, slim young fellow of eighteen or twenty, with\nblack eyes, and hair as dark as a raven’s wing; and his whole\nappearance bespoke that calmness and resolution peculiar to men\naccustomed from their cradle to contend with danger.\n\n“Ah, is it you, Dantès?” cried the man in the skiff. “What’s the\nmatter? and why have you such an air of sadness aboard?”\n\n“A great misfortune, M. Morrel,” replied the young man, “a great\nmisfortune, for me especially! Off Civita Vecchia we lost our brave\nCaptain Leclere.”\n\n“And the cargo?” inquired the owner, eagerly.\n\n“Is all safe, M. Morrel; and I think you will be satisfied on that\nhead. But poor Captain Leclere——”\n\n“What happened to him?” asked the owner, with an air of considerable\nresignation. “What happened to the worthy captain?”\n\n“He died.”\n\n“Fell into the sea?”\n\n“No, sir, he died of brain-fever in dreadful agony.” Then turning to\nthe crew, he said, “Bear a hand there, to take in sail!”\n\nAll hands obeyed, and at once the eight or ten seamen who composed the\ncrew, sprang to their respective stations at the spanker brails and\nouthaul, topsail sheets and halyards, the jib dow", "label": "CONTRADICT"}

A fit of laughter seized the\nwhole crew. Paganel, as if mad, ran to and fro, holding his head in his\nhands, and tearing his hair. However, when he had recovered from his\nfrenzy, there was still another unavoidable question to answer.\n\n\"Now, Paganel,\" said Glenarvan, \"be candid.

I am a madman, a fool, an incorrigible\nbeing, and shall die a most famous blunderer!\"\n\nThe affair was no longer discussed. The mystery of the Duncan's\npresence there was solved; and the travelers, so miraculously saved,\nthought only of revisiting their comfortable cabins and partaking of a\ngood breakfast.\n\nHowever, leaving Lady Helena, Mary Grant, the major, Paganel, and\nRobert to enter the saloon, Glenarvan and Captain Mangles retained Tom\nAustin with them. They wished to question him further.\n\n\"Now, Tom,\" said Glenarvan, \"let me know: did not this order to sail\nfor the coast of New Zealand seem strange to you?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord,\" replied Austin. \"I was very much surprised; but, as I\nam not in the habit of discussing the orders I receive, I obeyed.

Would you have done\ndifferently, captain?\"\n\n\"No, Tom,\" answered Captain Mangles.\n\n\"But what did you think?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"I thought, my lord, that, in the cause of Captain Grant, it was\nnecessary to go wherever you directed me; that by some combination of\ncircumstances another vessel would take you to New Zealand, and that\nI was to wait for you on the eastern coast of the island.

What invisible power restrained the natives?\nThe fugitives gazed without comprehending, fearing that the charm that\nenchained Kai-Koumou's tribe would dissolve.\n\nSuddenly Captain Mangles uttered a cry that caused his companions to\nturn. He pointed to a little fortress at the summit of the peak.\n\n\"The tomb of the chief Kara-Tété!\" cried Robert.\n\n\"Are you in earnest?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"Yes, my lord, it is the tomb; I recognize it.\"\n\nRobert was right. Fifty feet above, at the extreme point of the\nmountain, stood a small palisaded inclosure of freshly-painted stakes.\nGlenarvan, likewise, recognized the sepulchre of the Maori chief. In\ntheir wanderings they had come to the top of the Maunganamu, where\nKara-Tété had been buried.\n\nFollowed by his companions, he climbed the sides of the peak, to the\nvery foot of the tomb. A large opening, covered with mats, formed the\nentrance. Glenarvan was about to enter, when, all at once, he started\nback suddenly.\n\n\"A savage!\" said he.\n\n\"A savage in this tomb?\" inquired the major.\n\n\"Yes, MacNabb.\"\n\n\"What matter? Let us enter.\"\n\nGlenarvan, the major, Robert, and Captain Mangles passed into the\ninclosure. A Maori was there, clad in a great flax mantle. The darkness\nof the sepulchre did not permit them to distinguish his features. He\nappeared very calm, and was eating his breakfast with the most perfect\nindifference.\n\nGlenarvan was about to address him, when the native, anticipating him,\nsaid, in an amiable tone, and in excellent English:\n\n\"Be seated, my dear lord; breakfast is awaiting you.\"\n\nIt was Paganel. At his voice all rushed into the tomb, and gazed with\nwonder at the worthy geographer. Paganel was found! The common safety\nwas represented in him. They were going to question him: they wished\nto know how and why he was on the top of the mountain; but Glenarvan\nchecked this unseasonable curiosity.\n\n[Illustration: \"Be seated, my dear lord; breakfast is awaiting you.\"]\n\n\"The savages!\" said he.\n\n\"The savages,\" replied Paganel, shrugging his shoulders, \"are\nindividuals whom I supremely despise.\"\n\n\"But can they not----?\"\n\n\"They! the imbeciles! Come and see them.\"\n\nEach followed Paganel, who issued from the tomb. The Maoris were in the\nsame place, surrounding the foot of the peak, and uttering terrible\ncries.\n\n\"Cry and howl till you are tired, miserable creatures!\" said Paganel.\n\"I defy you to climb this mountain!\"\n\n\"And why?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"Because the chief is buried here; this tomb protects us, and the\nmountain is tabooed.\"\n\n\"Tabooed?\"\n\n\"Yes, my friends; and that is why I took refuge here, as in one of\nthose asylums of the Middle Ages, open to unfortunates.\"\n\nIndeed, the mountain was tabooed, and by this consecration had become\ninaccessible by the superstitious savages.\n\nThe safety of the fugitives was not yet certain, but there was a\nsalutary respite, of which they strove to take advantage. Glenarvan, a\nprey to unspeakable emotion, did not venture a word; while the major\nnodded his head with an air of genuine satisfaction.\n\n\"And now, my friends,\" said Paganel, \"if these brutes expect us to test\ntheir patience they are mistaken.

Towards noon they had to pass around\nthe shores of a small lake, the picturesque reservoir of all the\nneighboring streams which flowed into it.\n\nAbove the lake extended vast \"llanos,\" lofty plains, covered with\ngrass, where the herds of the Indians grazed. Then they came upon a\nswamp which extended to the south and north, but which the instinct\nof the mules enabled them to avoid. Soon Fort Ballenare appeared on a\nrocky peak which it crowned with its dismantled walls. The ascent had\nalready become abrupt and stony, and the pebbles, loosened by the hoofs\nof the mules, rolled under their feet in a rattling torrent.\n\nThe road now became difficult, and even perilous. The steepness\nincreased, the walls on either side approached each other more and\nmore, while the precipices yawned frightfully. The mules advanced\ncautiously in single file, with their noses to the ground, scenting the\nway.\n\nNow and then, at a sudden turn, the madrina disappeared, and the little\ncaravan was then guided by the distant tinkling of her bell. Sometimes,\ntoo, the capricious windings of the path would bend the column into\ntwo parallel lines, and the catapaz could talk to the peons, while a\ncrevasse, scarcely two fathoms wide, but two hundred deep, formed an\nimpassable abyss between them.\n\nUnder these conditions it was difficult to distinguish the course. The\nalmost incessant action of subterranean and volcanic agency changes\nthe road, and the landmarks are never the same. Therefore the catapaz\nhesitated, stopped, looked about him, examined the form of the rocks,\nand searched on the crumbling stones for the tracks of Indians.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nGlenarvan followed in the steps of his guide. He perceived, he _felt_,\nhis embarrassment, increasing with the difficulties of the way. He did\nnot dare to question him, but thought that it was better to trust to\nthe instinct of the muleteers and mules.\n\nFor an hour longer the catapaz wandered at a venture, but always\nseeking the more elevated parts of the mountain.

They were at the bottom of a narrow valley,--one of\nthose ravines that the Indians call \"quebradas.\" A perpendicular wall\nof porphyry barred their exit.\n\n[Sidenote: CLIMBING A MOUNTAIN.]\n\nThe catapaz, after searching vainly for a passage, dismounted, folded\nhis arms, and waited.

After ten minutes’ labor the wall\ngave way, and a hole large enough to insert the arm was opened.\n\nDantès went and cut the strongest olive-tree he could find, stripped\noff its branches, inserted it in the hole, and used it as a lever. But\nthe rock was too heavy, and too firmly wedged, to be moved by anyone\nman, were he Hercules himself. Dantès saw that he must attack the\nwedge. But how?\n\nHe cast his eyes around, and saw the horn full of powder which his\nfriend Jacopo had left him. He smiled; the infernal invention would\nserve him for this purpose.\n\nWith the aid of his pickaxe, Dantès, after the manner of a labor-saving\npioneer, dug a mine between the upper rock and the one that supported\nit, filled it with powder, then made a match by rolling his\nhandkerchief in saltpetre. He lighted it and retired.\n\nThe explosion soon followed; the upper rock was lifted from its base by\nthe terrific force of the powder; the lower one flew into pieces;\nthousands of insects escaped from the aperture Dantès had previously\nformed, and a huge snake, like the guardian demon of the treasure,\nrolled himself along in darkening coils, and disappeared.\n\nDantès approached the upper rock, which now, without any support,\nleaned towards the sea. The intrepid treasure-seeker walked round it,\nand, selecting the spot from whence it appeared most susceptible to\nattack, placed his lever in one of the crevices, and strained every\nnerve to move the mass.\n\nThe rock, already shaken by the explosion, tottered on its base. Dantès\nredoubled his efforts; he seemed like one of the ancient Titans, who\nuprooted the mountains to hurl against the father of the gods. The rock\nyielded, rolled over, bounded from point to point, and finally\ndisappeared in the ocean.\n\nOn the spot it had occupied was a circular space, exposing an iron ring\nlet into a square flag-stone.\n\nDantès uttered a cry of joy and surprise; never had a first attempt\nbeen crowned with more perfect success. He would fain have continued,\nbut his knees trembled, and his heart beat so violently, and his sight\nbecame so dim, that he was forced to pause.\n\nThis feeling lasted but for a moment. Edmond inserted his lever in the\nring and exerted all his strength; the flag-stone yielded, and\ndisclosed steps that descended until they were lost in the obscurity of\na subterraneous grotto.\n\nAnyone else would have rushed on with a cry of joy. Dantès turned pale,\nhesitated, and reflected.\n\n“Come,” said he to himself, “be a man. I am accustomed to adversity. I\nmust not be cast down by the discovery that I have been deceived. What,\nthen, would be the use of all I have suffered? The heart breaks when,\nafter having been elated by flattering hopes, it sees all its illusions\ndestroyed. Faria has dreamed this; the Cardinal Spada buried no\ntreasure here; perhaps he never came here, or if he did, Cæsar Borgia,\nthe intrepid adventurer, the stealthy and indefatigable plunderer, has\nfollowed him, discovered his traces, pursued them as I have done,\nraised the stone, and descending before me, has left me nothing.”\n\nHe remained motionless and pensive, his eyes fixed on the gloomy\naperture that was open at his feet.\n\n“Now that I expect nothing, now that I no longer entertain the\nslightest hopes, the end of this adventure becomes simply a matter of\ncuriosity.” And he remained again motionless and thoughtful.\n\n“Yes, yes; this is an adventure worthy a place in the varied career of\nthat royal bandit.

He was greatly\napplauded, but each retained his own opinion, and the geographer\nobtained the result common to most discussions,--of convincing nobody.\nHowever, they were agreed on this point, that it was necessary to have\ncourage for every fortune, and be contented with a tree when one has\nneither palace nor cottage.\n\nDuring the course of this confabulation evening had come on. Only a\ngood sleep could thoroughly refresh, after this eventful day. The\ninmates of the tree felt themselves not only fatigued by the sudden\nchanges of the inundation, but especially overcome by the heat, which\nhad been excessive. Their feathered companions had already set the\nexample; the hilgueros, those nightingales of the Pampas, had ceased\ntheir melodious warblings, and all the birds had disappeared in the\nrecesses of the foliage. The best plan was to imitate them.\n\nBut before \"retiring to their nest,\" as Paganel said, Glenarvan,\nRobert, and he climbed to the observatory, to examine for the last\ntime the watery expanse. It was about nine o'clock. The sun had just\nset in the sparkling mists of the horizon, and all the western part\nof the firmament was bathed in a warm vapor. The constellations,\nusually so dazzling, seemed veiled in a soft haze. Still they could\nbe distinguished, and Paganel pointed out to Robert, for Glenarvan's\nbenefit, that zone where the stars are most brilliant.\n\n[Sidenote: PHILOSOPHY AND PONCHOS.]\n\nWhile the geographer was discoursing thus, the whole eastern horizon\nassumed a stormy aspect. A dense and dark band, clearly defined,\ngradually rose, dimming the light of the stars. This cloud of\nthreatening appearance soon invaded almost the entire vault of the sky.\nIts motive power must have been inherent in itself, for there was not\na breath of wind. Not a leaf stirred on the tree, not a ripple curled\nthe surface of the waters. Even the air seemed to fail, as if some\nhuge pneumatic machine had rarefied it. A strong electric current was\nperceptible in the atmosphere, and every creature felt it course along\nthe nerves.

The worthy geographer almost fell backwards. \"A rough little\ngentleman,\" said he; \"I will teach him geography.\" As Captain Mangles\nhad engaged to make him a sailor, Glenarvan a man of honor, the major a\nboy of coolness, Lady Helena a noble and generous being, and Mary Grant\na pupil grateful towards such patrons, Robert was evidently to become\none day an accomplished gentleman.\n\nThe Duncan soon finished shipping her coal, and then leaving these\ngloomy regions she gained the current from the southeast coast of\nBrazil, and, after crossing the equator with a fine breeze from the\nnorth, she entered the southern hemisphere. The passage was effected\nwithout difficulty, and every one had good hopes. On this voyage in\nsearch of Captain Grant, the probabilities increased every day. Their\ncaptain was one of the most confident on board; but his confidence\nproceeded especially from the desire that he cherished so strongly at\nheart, of seeing Miss Mary happy and consoled. He was particularly\ninterested in this young girl; and this feeling he concealed so well,\nthat, except Miss Grant and himself, no one on board the Duncan had\nperceived it.\n\nAs for the learned geographer, he was probably the happiest man in the\nsouthern hemisphere. He passed his time in studying the maps with which\nhe covered the cabin-table; and then followed daily discussions with\nMr. Olbinett, so that he could scarcely set the table.\n\nBut Paganel had all the passengers on his side except the major,\nwho was very indifferent to geographical questions, especially at\ndinner-time. Having discovered a whole cargo of odd books in the mate's\nchests, and among them a number of Cervantes' works, the Frenchman\nresolved to learn Spanish, which nobody on board knew, and which would\nfacilitate his search on the shores of Chili. Thanks to his love for\nphilology, he did not despair of speaking this new tongue fluently on\narriving at Concepcion. He therefore studied assiduously, and was heard\nincessantly muttering heterogeneous syllables. During his leisure hours\nhe did not fail to give young Robert practical instruction, and taught\nhim the history of the country they were rapidly approaching.\n\nIn the meantime the Duncan was proceeding at a remarkable rate. She\ncut the Tropic of Capricorn, and her prow was headed toward the strait\nof the celebrated geographer. Now and then the low shores of Patagonia\nwere seen, but like an almost invisible line on the horizon. They\nsailed along the coast for more than ten miles, but Paganel's famous\ntelescope gave him only a vague idea of these American shores.\n\nThe vessel soon found herself at the head of the ", "label": "NEUTRAL"}

A second line of stakes, and then a fence of osiers,\npierced with loop-holes, inclosed the inner space, the court-yard of\nthe pah, in which stood several Maori tents, and forty huts which were\nsymmetrically arranged.\n\nOn their arrival, the captives were terribly impressed at sight of\nthe heads that ornamented the stakes of the second inclosure. Lady\nHelena and Mary Grant turned away their eyes with more of disgust than\nterror. These heads had most of them belonged to hostile chiefs, fallen\nin battle, whose bodies had served as food for the conquerors. The\ngeographer knew them to be such by their hollow and eyeless sockets!\n\nIn Kai-Koumou's pah only the heads of his enemies formed this frightful\nmuseum; and here, doubtless, more than one English skull had served to\nincrease the size of the chief's collection.\n\nHis hut, among those belonging to warriors of lower rank, stood at the\nrear of the pah, in front of a large open terrace. This structure was\nbuilt of stakes, interlaced with branches, and lined inside with flax\nmatting.\n\nOnly one opening gave access to the dwelling. A thick curtain, made\nof a vegetable tissue, served as a door. The roof projected so as to\nform a water-shed. Several faces, carved at the ends of the rafters,\nadorned the hut, and the curtain was covered with various imitations\nof foliage, symbolical figures, monsters, and graceful sculpturing,\na curious piece of work, fashioned by the scissors of the native\ndecorators.\n\n[Sidenote: FEMININE ORATORY.]\n\nInside of the habitation the floor was made of hard-trodden earth,\nand raised six inches above the ground. Several rush screens and some\nmattresses, covered with woven matting of long leaves and twigs,\nserved as beds. In the middle of the room a hole in a stone formed the\nfireplace, and another in the roof answered for a chimney.\n\nThe smoke, when it became sufficiently thick, perforce escaped at this\noutlet, but it of course blackened the walls of the house.\n\nOn one side of the hut were storehouses, containing the chief's\nprovisions, his harvest of flax, potatoes, and edible ferns, and\nthe ovens where the various articles of food were cooked by contact\nwith heated stones. Farther off, in small pens, pigs and goats were\nconfined, and dogs ran about seeking their scanty sustenance. They were\nrather poorly kept, for animals that formed the Maori daily food.\n\nGlenarvan and his companions had taken in the whole at a glance. They\nawaited beside an empty hut the good pleasure of the chief, exposed to\nthe insults of a crowd of old women, who surrounded them like harpies,\nand threatened them with their fists, crying and howling. Several\nEnglish words that passed their lips clearly indicated that they were\ndemanding immediate vengeance.\n\nIn the midst of these cries and threats, Lady Helena affected a\ncalmness that she could not feel in her heart. This courageous woman,\nin order that her husband's coolness might not forsake him, heroically\ncontrolled her emotions. Poor Mary Grant felt herself growing weak, and\nCaptain Mangles supported her, ready to die in her defence. The others\nendured this torrent of invectives in various ways, either indifferent\nlike the major, or increasingly annoyed like Paganel.\n\nGlenarvan, wishing to relieve Lady Helena from the assaults of these\nshrews, boldly approached Kai-Koumou, and, pointing to the hideous\nthrong, said:\n\n\"Drive them away!\"\n\nThe Maori chief gazed steadily at his prisoner without replying. Then\nwith a gesture he silenced the noisy horde. Glenarvan bowed in token of\nthanks, and slowly resumed his place among his friends.\n\nKai-Koumou, fearing an insurrection of the fanatics of his tribe, now\nled his captives to a sacred place, situated at the other end of the\npah, on the edge of a precipice.

The major was a man of fifty, of calm,\nregular features, who did as he was bid; of an excellent and superior\ncharacter, modest, taciturn, peaceable, and mild; always agreeing\nwith anything or any one, disputing nothing, and neither contradicting\nhimself nor exaggerating. He would mount with measured step the\nstaircase to his bed-chamber, even were a cannon-ball behind him; and\nprobably to his dying day would never find an opportunity to fly into a\npassion.\n\nThis man possessed, in a high degree, not only the common courage of\nthe battle-field (that physical bravery due only to nervous strength),\nbut, better still, moral courage, that is to say, firmness of soul. If\nhe had a fault, it was that of being absolutely Scotch from head to\nfoot, a pure-blooded Caledonian, an infatuated observer of the ancient\ncustoms of his country. Through his relationship to the Glenarvans he\nlived at Malcolm Castle; and as major and military man it was very\nnatural that he should be found on board the Duncan.\n\nSuch, then, were the passengers of this yacht, summoned by unforeseen\ncircumstances to accomplish one of the most surprising voyages of\nmodern times. Since her arrival at the wharf at Glasgow, she had\nmonopolized the public attention. A considerable number came every day\nto visit her. They were interested in her alone, and spoke only of her,\nto the great umbrage of the other captains of the port, among others\nCaptain Burton, commanding the Scotia, a magnificent steamer, moored\nbeside the Duncan, and bound for Calcutta. The Scotia, from her size,\nhad a right to consider the Duncan as a mere fly-boat. Nevertheless,\nall the attraction centred in Lord Glenarvan's yacht, and increased\nfrom day to day.\n\nThe time of departure approached. Captain Mangles had shown himself\nskillful and expeditious. A month after her trial trip in the Frith of\nClyde, the Duncan, laden, provisioned, and equipped, was ready to put\nto sea. The 25th of August was appointed for the time of departure,\nwhich would enable the yacht to reach the southern latitudes by the\nbeginning of spring. Lord Glenarvan, when his plan was matured, did\nnot neglect to make investigations into the hardships and perils of the\nvoyage; yet he did not hesitate on this account, but prepared to leave\nMalcolm Castle.\n\nOn the 24th of August, Lord and Lady Glenarvan, Major MacNabb, Mary and\nRobert Grant, Mr. Olbinett, the steward of the yacht, and his wife, who\nwas in the service of Lady Glenarvan, left the castle, after taking an\naffectionate farewell of their family servants. Several hours afterward\nthey found themselves on board. Many of the population of Glasgow\nwelcomed with sympathetic admiration the young and courageous lady who\nrenounced the pleasures of a life of luxury, and sailed to the rescue\nof the shipwrecked sailors.\n\nThe apartments of Lord Glenarvan and his wife occupied the entire stern\nof the vessel. They consisted of two bed-chambers, a parlor, and two\ndressing-rooms, adjoining which was an open square inclosed by six\ncabins, five of which were occupied by Mary and Robert Grant, Mr. and\nMrs. Olbinett, and Major MacNabb. As for the cabins of the captain and\nthe mate, they were situated in the forecastle, and opened on the deck.\nThe crew were lodged between-decks very comfortably, for the yacht of\ncourse carried nothing but her coal, provisions, and armament.\n\nThe Duncan was to start on the night of the 24th, as the tide fell at\nthree o'clock in the morning.

It had an enormous, twisted trunk, and was confined to the\nearth not only by its great roots, but also by strong shoots which held\nit most tenaciously. It had thus resisted the force of the inundation.\n\n[Sidenote: AN ORNITHOLOGICAL OMNIUM-GATHERUM.]\n\nThis ombu measured one hundred feet in height, and might have covered\nwith its shade a circumference of three hundred and sixty feet. All\nthe upper part rested on three great branches, which forked from the\ntop of the trunk, that was six feet in diameter. Two of these branches\nwere nearly perpendicular, and supported the immense canopy of foliage,\nwhose crossed, twisted, and interlaced limbs, as if woven by the hand\nof a basket-maker, formed an impenetrable shelter. The third branch,\non the contrary, extended almost horizontally over the roaring waters;\nits leaves were bathed in them, while it seemed a promontory to this\nisland of verdure surrounded by an ocean. There was abundant space,\nalso, in the interior of this gigantic tree. The foliage, which was\nnot very dense at its outer circumference, left large openings like\nsky-lights, and made it well ventilated and cool. At sight of these\nbranches rising in innumerable ramifications towards the clouds, while\nthe parasitic convolvuli bound them to each other, and the rays of the\nsun shone through the interstices of the leaves, you would really have\nthought that the trunk of this ombu bore upon itself alone an entire\nforest.\n\nOn the arrival of the fugitives, a feathered population flew away to\nthe top branches, protesting by their cries against so flagran", "label": "SUPPORT"}

These unfortunate females conscientiously fulfilled their\nbarbarous duty.\n\nBut these demonstrations were not enough to appease the soul of the\ndeceased, whose wrath would doubtless have smitten the survivors of his\ntribe; and his warriors, as they could not recall him to life, wished\nthat he should have no cause to regret in the other world the happiness\nof this.\n\nKara-Tété's wife was not to forsake her husband in the tomb. Moreover,\nthe unfortunate woman would not have been allowed to survive him;\nit was the custom, in accordance with duty, and examples of such\nsacrifices are not wanting in New Zealand history. The woman appeared.\nShe was still young. Her hair floated in disorder over her shoulders.\nVague words, lamentations, and broken phrases, in which she celebrated\nthe virtues of the dead, interrupted her groans; and, in a final\nparoxysm of grief, she stretched herself at the foot of the mound,\nbeating the ground with her head.\n\nAt this moment Kai-Koumou approached her.

They were servants, whom the pitiless laws of war had reduced\nto slavery. During the life of the chief they had undergone the\nseverest privations, suffered a thousand abuses, had been scantily fed,\nand compelled constantly to labor like beasts; and now, according to\nthe Maori belief, they were to continue their existence of servitude\nfor eternity.\n\nThey appeared to be resigned to their fate, and were not astonished\nat a sacrifice they had long anticipated. Their freedom from all\nbonds showed that they would meet death unresistingly. Moreover, this\ndeath was rapid, protracted sufferings were spared them. These were\nreserved for the captives who stood trembling not twenty paces distant.\nSix blows of the méré, given by six stalwart warriors, stretched the\nvictims on the ground in a pool of blood. It was the signal for a\nterrible scene of cannibalism, which followed in all its horrible\ndetails.\n\nGlenarvan and his companions, breathless with fright, strove to hide\nthis awful scene from the eyes of the two unhappy ladies. They now\nunderstood what awaited them at sunrise the next day, and what cruel\ntortures would doubtless precede such a death. They were dumb with\nhorror.\n\nThe funeral dance now began. Strong spirits, extracted from an\nindigenous plant, maddened the savages till they seemed no longer\nhuman.

These convicts are twenty-nine in\nnumber, and are commanded by a certain Ben Joyce, a dangerous criminal,\nwho arrived in Australia several months ago in some way, and upon whom\njustice has not yet succeeded in laying hands.

I could recite you the whole of Thucydides, Xenophon,\nPlutarch, Titus Livius, Tacitus, Strada, Jornandes, Dante, Montaigne,\nShakespeare, Spinoza, Machiavelli, and Bossuet. I name only the most\nimportant.”\n\n“You are, doubtless, acquainted with a variety of languages, so as to\nhave been able to read all these?”\n\n“Yes, I speak five of the modern tongues—that is to say, German,\nFrench, Italian, English, and Spanish; by the aid of ancient Greek I\nlearned modern Greek—I don’t speak it so well as I could wish, but I am\nstill trying to improve myself.”\n\n“Improve yourself!” repeated Dantès; “why, how can you manage to do\nso?”\n\n“Why, I made a vocabulary of the words I knew; turned, returned, and\narranged them, so as to enable me to express my thoughts through their\nmedium. I know nearly one thousand words, which is all that is\nabsolutely necessary, although I believe there are nearly one hundred\nthousand in the dictionaries. I cannot hope to be very fluent, but I\ncertainly should have no difficulty in explaining my wants and wishes;\nand that would be quite as much as I should ever require.”\n\nStronger grew the wonder of Dantès, who almost fancied he had to do\nwith one gifted with supernatural powers; still hoping to find some\nimperfection which might bring him down to a level with human beings,\nhe added, “Then if you were not furnished with pens, how did you manage\nto write the work you speak of?”\n\n“I made myself some excellent ones, which would be universally\npreferred to all others if once known.

Luigi Vampa comes to take us, and we take him—we\nbring him back to Rome, and present him to his holiness the Pope, who\nasks how he can repay so great a service; then we merely ask for a\ncarriage and a pair of horses, and we see the Carnival in the carriage,\nand doubtless the Roman people will crown us at the Capitol, and\nproclaim us, like Curtius and Horatius Cocles, the preservers of their\ncountry.”\n\nWhilst Albert proposed this scheme, Signor Pastrini’s face assumed an\nexpression impossible to describe.\n\n“And pray,” asked Franz, “where are these pistols, blunderbusses, and\nother deadly weapons with which you intend filling the carriage?”\n\n“Not out of my armory, for at Terracina I was plundered even of my\nhunting-knife.

And now, by a strange fatality,\nthe convict was in their power.\n\n\"Where is he?\" asked Glenarvan quickly.\n\n\"In a cabin in the forecastle,\" replied Tom Austin, \"closely guarded.\"\n\n\"Why this confinement?\"\n\n[Sidenote: AN UNOFFICIAL TRIBUNAL.]\n\n\"Because, when Ayrton saw that the yacht was sailing for New Zealand,\nhe flew into a passion; because he attempted to force me to change the\nship's course; because he threatened me; and, finally, because he urged\nmy men to a mutiny. I saw that he was a dangerous person, and was\ncompelled, therefore, to take precautions against him.\"\n\n\"And since that time?\"\n\n\"Since that time he has been in his cabin, without offering to come\nout.\"\n\n\"Good!\"\n\nAt this moment Glenarvan and Captain Mangles were summoned to the\nsaloon. Breakfast, which they so much needed, was ready. They took\nseats at the table, but did not speak of Ayrton.\n\nHowever, when the meal was ended, and the passengers had assembled on\ndeck, Glenarvan informed them of the quartermaster's presence on board.\nAt the same time he declared his intention of sending for him.\n\n\"Can I be released from attending this tribunal?\" asked Lady Helena.\n\"I confess to you, my dear Edward, that the sight of this unfortunate\nwould be very painful to me.\"\n\n\"It is only to confront him, Helena,\" replied Glenarvan. \"Remain,\nif you can.

The crew of the yacht, who did\nnot yet understand the seriousness of these proceedings, maintained a\nprofound silence.\n\n\"Call Ayrton!\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVI.\n\nAYRTON'S OBSTINACY.\n\n\nAyrton soon made his appearance. He crossed the deck with a confident\nstep, and ascended the poop-stairs. His eyes had a sullen look, his\nteeth were set, and his fists clinched convulsively. His bearing\ndisplayed neither exultation nor humility. As soon as he was in Lord\nGlenarvan's presence, he folded his arms, and calmly and silently\nwaited to be questioned:\n\n\"Ayrton,\" said Glenarvan, \"here we all are, as you see, on board the\nDuncan, that you would have surrendered to Ben Joyce's accomplices.\"\n\nAt these words the lips of the quartermaster slightly trembled. A quick\nblush colored his hard features,--not the sign of remorse, but the\nshame of defeat. He was prisoner on this yacht that he had meant to\ncommand as master, and his fate was soon to be decided.\n\nHowever, he made no reply. Glenarvan waited patiently, but Ayrton still\npersisted in maintaining an obstinate silence.\n\n\"Speak, Ayrton; what have you to say?\" continued Glenarvan.\n\nThe convict hesitated, and the lines of his forehead were strongly\ncontracted. At last he said, in a calm voice:\n\n\"I have nothing to say, my lord. I was foolish enough to let myself be\ntaken. Do what you please.\"\n\n[Sidenote: A DUMB PRISONER.]\n\nHaving given his answer, the quartermaster turned his eyes toward\nthe coast that extended along the west, and affected a profound\nindifference for all that was passing around him.

With the\ncrew once at sea, and a vessel like the Duncan, we shall be masters\nof the Indian Ocean.' 'Hurrah for Ben Joyce!' cried the convicts.\nMulready's horse was then led up, and Ben Joyce disappeared at a gallop\non the Lucknow road, while the band proceeded southeastward to the\nSnowy River. Mulready, although severely wounded, had strength to drag\nhimself within two hundred paces of the encampment, where we picked him\nup almost dead. This,\" added MacNabb, \"is Mulready's sad story.

I will undertake this.\"\n\n\"I will accompany you, captain,\" replied Paganel.\n\n[Sidenote: THE BURNED BRIDGE.]\n\nThis proposal was accepted, and the captain and Paganel prepared to\nstart immediately. They were to follow along the bank of the river till\nthey came to the place indicated by Ben Joyce, and keep out of sight\nof the convicts, who were probably lying in wait. These two courageous\nmen accordingly, well furnished with arms and provisions, set out, and\nsoon disappeared among the tall rushes of the river.\n\n[Illustration: The animal reared. Mulready seized his revolver and\nfired.]\n\nAll day the little party waited for them. At evening they had not yet\nreturned, and great fears were entertained. At last, about eleven\no'clock, Wilson announced their approach. They arrived, worn out with\nthe fatigues of a six-mile journey.\n\n\"The bridge? Is it there?\" asked Glenarvan, rushing to meet them.\n\n\"Yes, a bridge of rushes,\" said Captain Mangles. \"The convicts passed,\nit is true, but----\"\n\n\"But what?\" cried Glenarvan, who foresaw a new calamity.\n\n\"They burned it after their passage,\" replied Paganel.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIII.\n\nHELPLESS AND HOPELESS.\n\n\nIt was not the time to despair, but to act. If Kemple Pier bridge was\ndestroyed, they must cross the Snowy at all events, and reach Twofold\nBay before Ben Joyce's band.

They\nwhirled along with indescribable fury. It was certain death to brave\nthis torrent.

But we have not done with the thing\nyet.”\n\n0087m\n\n\n\n“Do you, indeed, think so?” inquired the marquise.\n\n“I am, at least, fearful of it. Napoleon, in the Island of Elba, is too\nnear France, and his proximity keeps up the hopes of his partisans.\nMarseilles is filled with half-pay officers, who are daily, under one\nfrivolous pretext or other, getting up quarrels with the royalists;\nfrom hence arise continual and fatal duels among the higher classes of\npersons, and assassinations in the lower.”\n\n“You have heard, perhaps,” said the Comte de Salvieux, one of M. de\nSaint-Méran’s oldest friends, and chamberlain to the Comte d’Artois,\n“that the Holy Alliance purpose removing him from thence?”\n\n“Yes; they were talking about it when we left Paris,” said M. de\nSaint-Méran; “and where is it decided to transfer him?”\n\n“To Saint Helena.”\n\n“For heaven’s sake, where is that?” asked the marquise.\n\n“An island situated on the other side of the equator, at least two\nthousand leagues from here,” replied the count.\n\n“So much the better.

And with overpowering compliments her handsome\ncavalier led her back to the place whence he had taken her, and where\nLuigi awaited her. Twice or thrice during the dance the young girl had\nglanced at Luigi, and each time she saw that he was pale and that his\nfeatures were agitated, once even the blade of his knife, half drawn\nfrom its sheath, had dazzled her eyes with its sinister glare. Thus, it\nwas almost tremblingly that she resumed her lover’s arm. The quadrille\nhad been most perfect, and it was evident there was a great demand for\na repetition, Carmela alone objecting to it, but the Count of\nSan-Felice besought his daughter so earnestly, that she acceded.\n\n“One of the cavaliers then hastened to invite Teresa, without whom it\nwas impossible for the quadrille to be formed, but the young girl had\ndisappeared.\n\n“The truth was, that Luigi had not felt the strength to support another\nsuch trial, and, half by persuasion and half by force, he had removed\nTeresa toward another part of the garden. Teresa had yielded in spite\nof herself, but when she looked at the agitated countenance of the\nyoung man, she understood by his silence and trembling voice that\nsomething strange was passing within him. She herself was not exempt\nfrom internal emotion, and without having done anything wrong, yet\nfully comprehended that Luigi was right in reproaching her. Why, she\ndid not know, but yet she did not the less feel that these reproaches\nwere merited.\n\n“However, to Teresa’s great astonishment, Luigi remained mute, and not\na word escaped his lips the rest of the evening. When the chill of the\nnight had driven away the guests from the gardens, and the gates of the\nvilla were closed on them for the _festa_ in-doors, he took Teresa\nquite away, and as he left her at her home, he said:\n\n“‘Teresa, what were you thinking of as you danced opposite the young\nCountess of San-Felice?’\n\n“‘I thought,’ replied the young girl, with all the frankness of her\nnature, ‘that I would give half my life for a costume such as she\nwore.’\n\n“‘And what said your cavalier to you?’\n\n“‘He said it only depended on myself to have it, and I had only one\nword to say.’\n\n“‘He was right,’ said Luigi. ‘Do you desire it as ardently as you say?’\n\n“‘Yes.’\n\n“‘Well, then, you shall have it!’\n\n“The young girl, much astonished, raised her head to look at him, but\nhis face was so gloomy and terrible that her words froze to her lips.\nAs Luigi spoke thus, he left her. Teresa followed him with her eyes\ninto the darkness as long as she could, and when he had quite\ndisappeared, she went into the house with a sigh.\n\n20121m\n\n\n\n“That night a memorable event occurred, due, no doubt, to the\nimprudence of some servant who had neglected to extinguish the lights.\nThe Villa of San-Felice took fire in the rooms adjoining the very\napartment of the lovely Carmela. Awakened in the night by the light of\nthe flames, she sprang out of bed, wrapped herself in a dressing-gown,\nand attempted to escape by the door, but the corridor by which she\nhoped to fly was already a prey to the flames. She then returned to her\nroom, calling for help as loudly as she could, when suddenly her\nwindow, which was twenty feet from the ground, was opened, a young\npeasant jumped into the chamber, seized her in his arms, and with\nsuperhuman skill and strength conveyed her to the turf of the\ngrass-plot, where she fainted. When she recovered, her father was by\nher side. All the servants surrounded her, offering her assistance. An\nentire wing of the villa was burnt down; but what of that, as long as\nCarmela was safe and uninjured?\n\n“Her preserver was everywhere sought for, but he did not appear; he was\ninquired after, but no one had seen him.

About midnight,\nthe travelers, surprised in their sleep, were made prisoners and\ncarried on board the canoe. They had not yet been maltreated, but had\ntried in vain to resist. Their arms and ammunition were in the hands of\nthe savages, and their own bullets would have quickly stretched them on\nthe earth had they attempted to escape.\n\nThey were not long in learning, by the aid of a few English words which\nthe natives used, that, being driven back by the British troops, they\nwere returning, vanquished and weakened, to the regions of the upper\nWaikato. Their chief, after an obstinate resistance, in which he lost\nhis principal warriors, was now on his way to rouse again the river\ntribes. He was called Kai-Koumou, a terrible name, which signified\nin the native language \"he who eats the limbs of his enemy.\" He was\nbrave and bold, but his cruelty equaled his bravery. No pity could be\nexpected from him. His name was well known to the English soldiers, and\na price had been set upon his head by the governor of New Zealand.\n\nThis terrible catastrophe had come upon Glenarvan just as he was\nabout reaching the long-desired harbor of Auckland, whence he would\nhave returned to his native country. Yet, looking at his calm and\npassionless countenance, you could not have divined the depth of his\nanguish, for in his present critical situation he did not betray the\nextent of his misfortunes. He felt that he ought to set an example of\nfortitude to his wife and his companions, as being the husband and\nchief. Moreover, he was ready to die first for the common safety, if\ncircumstances should require it.\n\n[Sidenote: CHIEFS, CIVILIZED AND UNCIVILIZED.]\n\nHis companions were worthy of him; they shared his noble thoughts, and\ntheir calm and haughty appearance would scarcely have intimated that\nthey were being carried away to captivity and suffering. By common\nconsent, at Glenarvan's suggestion, they had resolved to feign a proud\nindifference in the presence of the savages. It was the only way of\ninfluencing those fierce natures.\n\n[Illustration: A boat might have been seen ascending the Waikato. It\nwas a canoe seventy feet long and five broad.]\n\nSince leaving the encampment, the natives, taciturn like all savages,\nhad scarcely spoken to each other. However, from a few words exchanged,\nGlenarvan perceived that they were acquainted with the English\nlanguage. He therefore resolved to question the chief in regard to the\nfate that was in store for them. Addressing Kai-Koumou, he said, in a\nfearless tone:\n\n\"Where are you taking us, chief?\"\n\nKai-Koumou gazed at him coldly without answering.\n\n\"Say, what do you expect to do with us?\" continued Glenarvan.\n\nThe chief's eyes blazed with a sudden light, and in a stern voice he\nreplied:\n\n\"To exchange you, if your friends will ransom you; to kill you, if they\nrefuse.\"\n\nGlenarvan asked no more, but hope returned to his heart. Doubtless,\nsome chiefs of the Maori tribe had fallen into the hands of the\nEnglish, and the natives would attempt to recover them by way of\nexchange; their situation, therefore, was not one for despair.\n\nMeantime the canoe rapidly ascended the river.

The Patagonian took two steps forward;\nGlenarvan took his hand, and pressed it.

Never within his\nrecollection, since he had performed the office of guide, had his feet\ntrodden a soil so saturated.

It was advisable, therefore, to cross without delay these\nsloping terraces that an inundation would have instantly transformed\ninto a lake.\n\nThey hastened their pace, though there was no great depth to the water\nwhich spread out in a sheet beneath the horses' feet. About two o'clock\nthe flood-gates of the heavens opened, and tropical torrents of rain\ndescended. Never was a finer opportunity presented for showing oneself\na philosopher. There was no chance of escaping this deluge, and it was\nbetter for the travelers to receive it stoically. Their ponchos were\nsoon dripping, and their hats wet them still more, like roofs whose\ngutters have overflowed. The fringes of the saddle-cloths seemed so\nmany liquid streams; and the horsemen, bespattered by their animals,\nwhose hoofs splashed in the water at every step, rode in a double\nshower, which came from the ground as well as the sky.\n\n[Sidenote: HYDROPATHIC TREATMENT.]\n\nIt was in this wretchedly cold and exhausted state that they arrived,\ntowards evening, at a very miserable rancho. Only people who were not\nfastidious could have given it the name of a shelter, only travelers in\ndistress would consent to occupy it. But Glenarvan and his companions\nhad no choice. They therefore cowered down in the abandoned hut which\nwould not have satisfied even a poor Indian of the plains. A sorry\nfire of grass, which gave out more smoke than heat, was kindled with\ndifficulty. The torrents of rain made havoc without, and large drops\noozed through the mouldy thatch.

The fury of the sea can\noften be appeased by covering it with a sheet of oil, which floats\non the surface and destroys the shock of the waters. The effect is\ninstantaneous, but transient. As soon as a ship has crossed this\ntreacherous sea, it redoubles its fury; and woe to those who would\nventure to follow.\n\nThe barrels containing the supply of seal-oil were hoisted into the\nforecastle by the crew, to whom the danger gave new strength. Here\nthey were stove in with a blow of the hatchet, and suspended over the\nstarboard rattlings.\n\n\"Hold on!\" cried the captain, waiting for the favorable moment.\n\nIn a few seconds the yacht reached the entrance to the pass, which was\nbarred by a terrible line of foam.\n\n\"Let go!\" cried the young captain.\n\nThe barrels were inverted, and from their sides streamed floods of oil.\nImmediately the unctuous liquid leveled the foaming surface of the sea,\nand the Duncan sailed on calm waters, and was soon in a quiet harbor\nbeyond the terrible sand-bars; and then the ocean, released from its\nfetters, bounded after its escaped prey with indescribable fury.\n\n[Illustration: \"Let go!\" cried the young captain.

Morrel,” replied Villefort. “The order of\nimprisonment came from high authority, and the order for his liberation\nmust proceed from the same source; and, as Napoleon has scarcely been\nreinstated a fortnight, the letters have not yet been forwarded.”\n\n“But,” said Morrel, “is there no way of expediting all these\nformalities—of releasing him from arrest?”\n\n“There has been no arrest.”\n\n“How?”\n\n“It is sometimes essential to government to cause a man’s disappearance\nwithout leaving any traces, so that no written forms or documents may\ndefeat their wishes.”\n\n“It might be so under the Bourbons, but at present——”\n\n“It has always been so, my dear Morrel, since the reign of Louis XIV.\nThe emperor is more strict in prison discipline than even Louis\nhimself, and the number of prisoners whose names are not on the\nregister is incalculable.” Had Morrel even any suspicions, so much\nkindness would have dispelled them.\n\n“Well, M. de Villefort, how would you advise me to act?” asked he.\n\n“Petition the minister.”\n\n“Oh, I know what that is; the minister receives two hundred petitions\nevery day, and does not read three.”\n\n“That is true; but he will read a petition countersigned and presented\nby me.”\n\n“And will you undertake to deliver it?”\n\n“With the greatest pleasure. Dantès was then guilty, and now he is\ninnocent, and it is as much my duty to free him as it was to condemn\nhim.” Villefort thus forestalled any danger of an inquiry, which,\nhowever improbable it might be, if it did take place would leave him\ndefenceless.\n\n“But how shall I address the minister?”\n\n“Sit down there,” said Villefort, giving up his place to Morrel, “and\nwrite what I dictate.”\n\n“Will you be so good?”\n\n“Certainly. But lose no time; we have lost too much already.”\n\n“That is true. Only think what the poor fellow may even now be\nsuffering.”\n\nVillefort shuddered at the suggestion; but he had gone too far to draw\nback. Dantès must be crushed to gratify Villefort’s ambition.\n\nVillefort dictated a petition, in which, from an excellent intention,\nno doubt, Dantès’ patriotic services were exaggerated, and he was made\nout one of the most active agents of Napoleon’s return. It was evident\nthat at the sight of this document the minister would instantly release\nhim. The petition finished, Villefort read it aloud.\n\n“That will do,” said he; “leave the rest to me.”\n\n“Will the petition go soon?”\n\n“Today.”\n\n“Countersigned by you?”\n\n“The best thing I can do will be to certify the truth of the contents\nof your petition.” And, sitting down, Villefort wrote the certificate\nat the bottom.\n\n“What more is to be done?”\n\n“I will do whatever is necessary.” This assurance delighted Morrel, who\ntook leave of Villefort, and hastened to announce to old Dantès that he\nwould soon see his son.\n\nAs for Villefort, instead of sending to Paris, he carefully preserved\nthe petition that so fearfully compromised Dantès, in the hopes of an\nevent that seemed not unlikely,—that is, a second restoration. Dantès\nremained a prisoner, and heard not the noise of the fall of Louis\nXVIII.’s throne, or the still more tragic destruction of the empire.\n\nTwice during the Hundred Days had Morrel renewed his demand, and twice\nhad Villefort soothed him with promises. At last there was Waterloo,\nand Morrel came no more; he had done all that was in his power, and any\nfresh attempt would only compromise himself uselessly.\n\nLouis XVIII. remounted the throne; Villefort, to whom Marseilles had\nbecome filled with remorseful memories, sought and obtained the\nsituation of king’s procureur at Toulouse, and a fortnight afterwards\nhe married Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran, whose father now stood higher\nat court than ever.\n\nAnd so Dantès, after the Hundred Days and after Waterloo, remained in\nhis dungeon, forgotten of earth and heaven.\n\nDanglars comprehended the full extent of the wretched fate that\noverwhelmed Dantès; and, when Napoleon retu", "label": "NEUTRAL"}

These facts, proved already by the precise details given\nby Ayrton, are still further corroborated by the conversation of the\nconvicts that I have related.

The forests of\nOceanica are entirely different from those of the New World, and the\neucalyptus--the \"tara\" of the aborigines--is the most perfect tree of\nthe Australian flora.\n\nThe shade is not dense, nor the darkness profound, beneath these domes\nof verdure, owing to a strange peculiarity in the arrangement of the\nleaves of the eucalyptus.

Thus the rays of the sun glide to the earth as if they had\npassed between the slats of a window-blind.\n\nEvery one observed this and seemed surprised. Why this particular\narrangement? This question was naturally addressed to Paganel, who\nreplied like a man who is never at fault.\n\n\"What astonishes me,\" said he, \"is not the freak of nature, for she\nknows what she does; but botanists do not always know what they say.\nNature was not mistaken in giving to these trees this singular foliage;\nbut men are wrong in calling them eucalyptuses.\"\n\n\"What does the word mean?\" asked Mary Grant.\n\n\"It comes from the Greek words [Greek: eu kalyptô], signifying _I cover\nwell_.

A few cockatoos\ninhabited the tops of the trees; but at that height they could scarcely\nbe distinguished, and their chattering was an almost inaudible murmur.\nSometimes a flock of parrots would shoot across a distant vista,\nillumining it with a rapid flash of variegated light.

Its sides were very thick, and\ncapable of supporting a pressure of several atmospheres, betraying\nevidently previous connection with champagne.

About midnight,\nthe travelers, surprised in their sleep, were made prisoners and\ncarried on board the canoe. They had not yet been maltreated, but had\ntried in vain to resist. Their arms and ammunition were in the hands of\nthe savages, and their own bullets would have quickly stretched them on\nthe earth had they attempted to escape.\n\nThey were not long in learning, by the aid of a few English words which\nthe natives used, that, being driven back by the British troops, they\nwere returning, vanquished and weakened, to the regions of the upper\nWaikato. Their chief, after an obstinate resistance, in which he lost\nhis principal warriors, was now on his way to rouse again the river\ntribes. He was called Kai-Koumou, a terrible name, which signified\nin the native language \"he who eats the limbs of his enemy.\" He was\nbrave and bold, but his cruelty equaled his bravery. No pity could be\nexpected from him. His name was well known to the English soldiers, and\na price had been set upon his head by the governor of New Zealand.\n\nThis terrible catastrophe had come upon Glenarvan just as he was\nabout reaching the long-desired harbor of Auckland, whence he would\nhave returned to his native country. Yet, looking at his calm and\npassionless countenance, you could not have divined the depth of his\nanguish, for in his present critical situation he did not betray the\nextent of his misfortunes. He felt that he ought to set an example of\nfortitude to his wife and his companions, as being the husband and\nchief. Moreover, he was ready to die first for the common safety, if\ncircumstances should require it.\n\n[Sidenote: CHIEFS, CIVILIZED AND UNCIVILIZED.]\n\nHis companions were worthy of him; they shared his noble thoughts, and\ntheir calm and haughty appearance would scarcely have intimated that\nthey were being carried away to captivity and suffering. By common\nconsent, at Glenarvan's suggestion, they had resolved to feign a proud\nindifference in the presence of the savages. It was the only way of\ninfluencing those fierce natures.\n\n[Illustration: A boat might have been seen ascending the Waikato. It\nwas a canoe seventy feet long and five broad.]\n\nSince leaving the encampment, the natives, taciturn like all savages,\nhad scarcely spoken to each other. However, from a few words exchanged,\nGlenarvan perceived that they were acquainted with the English\nlanguage. He therefore resolved to question the chief in regard to the\nfate that was in store for them. Addressing Kai-Koumou, he said, in a\nfearless tone:\n\n\"Where are you taking us, chief?\"\n\nKai-Koumou gazed at him coldly without answering.\n\n\"Say, what do you expect to do with us?\" continued Glenarvan.\n\nThe chief's eyes blazed with a sudden light, and in a stern voice he\nreplied:\n\n\"To exchange you, if your friends will ransom you; to kill you, if they\nrefuse.\"\n\nGlenarvan asked no more, but hope returned to his heart.

Masses of vapor, generated by the high temperature\nof the preceding days, condensed into thick clouds and threatened to\ndissolve in showers of rain. Moreover, the proximity of the Atlantic,\nand the west wind, which here reigns supreme, rendered the climate of\nthis region peculiarly moist. However, for that day at least the heavy\nclouds did not break; and at evening the horses, after traveling forty\nmiles, halted on the edge of a deep \"cañada,\" an immense natural ditch\nfilled with water. A shelter was wanting, but the ponchos served for\ntents as well as clothing, and peaceful slumbers enwrapped all.\n\nThe next day, as they progressed farther, the presence of subterranean\nstreams betrayed itself more noticeably, and moisture was seen in every\ndepression of the ground. Soon they came to large ponds, some already\ndeep and others just forming. So long as there were only lagoons, the\nhorses could easily extricate themselves; but with these treacherous\nswamps it was more difficult.

Lady Helena and Mary\nGrant, suppressing their terror, conversed in low tones with Glenarvan,\nand the most skillful physiognomist could not have detected on their\nfaces the anxiety of their hearts.\n\nThe Waikato River is worshiped by the natives, as Paganel knew, and\nEnglish and German naturalists have never ascended beyond its junction\nwith the Waipa. Whither did Kai-Koumou intend to take his captives?\nThe geographer could not have guessed if the word \"Taupo,\" frequently\nrepeated, had not attracted his attention. By consulting his map,\nhe saw that this name was applied to a celebrated lake in the most\nmountainous part of the island, and that from it the Waikato flows.\n\nPaganel, addressing Captain Mangles in French, so as not to be\nunderstood by the savages, asked him how fast the canoe was going. The\ncaptain thought about three miles an hour.\n\n\"Then,\" replied the geographer, \"if we do not travel during the night,\nour voyage to the lake will last about four days.\"\n\n\"But whereabouts are the English garrisons?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"It is difficult to say,\" replied Paganel. \"At all events, the war\nmust have reached the province of Taranaki, and probably the troops\nare collected beyond the mountains, on the side of the lake where the\nhabitations of the savages are concentrated.\"\n\n\"God grant it!\" said Lady Helena.\n\nGlenarvan cast a sorrowful glance at his young wife and Mary Grant,\nexposed to the mercy of these fierce natives, and captives in a wild\ncountry, far from all human assistance. But he saw that he was watched\nby Kai-Koumou, and, not wishing to show that one of the captives was\nhis wife, he prudently kept his thoughts to himself, and gazed at the\nbanks of the river with apparent indifference.\n\n[Sidenote: ACCESSIONS, AND PROGRESS.]\n\nThe sun was just sinking below the horizon as the canoe ran upon a bank\nof pumice-stones, which the Waikato carries with it from its source\nin the volcanic mountains.

All were placed\nin the centre of the encampment, around which large fires formed an\nimpassable barrier.\n\nBefore Kai-Koumou had informed his captives of his intention to\nexchange them, Glenarvan and Captain Mangles had discussed various\nmethods of recovering their liberty. What they could not venture in the\nboat they hoped to attempt on land, at the hour for encamping, under\ncover of the night.\n\nBut since Glenarvan's conversation with the chief, it seemed wise to\nabandon this design. They must be patient. It was the most prudent\nplan. The exchange offered chances that neither an open attack nor a\nflight across these unknown regions could afford. Many circumstances\nmight indeed arise that would delay, and even prevent, such a\ntransaction; but still it was better to await the result. What,\nmoreover, could ten defenceless men do against thirty well-armed\nsavages? Besides, Glenarvan thought it likely that Kai-Koumou's tribe\nhad lost some chief of high rank whom they were particularly anxious to\nrecover; and he was not mistaken.\n\nThe next day the canoe ascended the river with increased swiftness.\nIt stopped for a moment at the junction of a small river which wound\nacross the plains on the right bank.

The Patagonian took two steps forward;\nGlenarvan took his hand, and pressed it. There was in the latter's\nlook, in his physiognomy, such a feeling, such an expression of\ngratitude, that the native could not mistake it.

Masses of vapor, generated by the high temperature\nof the preceding days, condensed into thick clouds and threatened to\ndissolve in showers of rain. Moreover, the proximity of the Atlantic,\nand the west wind, which here reigns supreme, rendered the climate of\nthis region peculiarly moist. However, for that day at least the heavy\nclouds did not break; and at evening the horses, after traveling forty\nmiles, halted on the edge of a deep \"cañada,\" an immense natural ditch\nfilled with water. A shelter was wanting, but the ponchos served for\ntents as well as clothing, and peaceful slumbers enwrapped all.\n\nThe next day, as they progressed farther, the presence of subterranean\nstreams betrayed itself more noticeably, and moisture was seen in every\ndepression of the ground. Soon they came to large ponds, some already\ndeep and others just forming. So long as there were only lagoons, the\nhorses could easily extricate themselves; but with these treacherous\nswamps it was more difficult. Tall grass obstructed them, and it was\nnecessary to incur the danger before it could be understood.

He was greatly\napplauded, but each retained his own opinion, and the geographer\nobtained the result common to most discussions,--of convincing nobody.\nHowever, they were agreed on this point, that it was necessary to have\ncourage for every fortune, and be contented with a tree when one has\nneither palace nor cottage.\n\nDuring the course of this confabulation evening had come on. Only a\ngood sleep could thoroughly refresh, after this eventful day. The\ninmates of the tree felt themselves not only fatigued by the sudden\nchanges of the inundation, but especially overcome by the heat, which\nhad been excessive. Their feathered companions had already set the\nexample; the hilgueros, those nightingales of the Pampas, had ceased\ntheir melodious warblings, and all the birds had disappeared in the\nrecesses of the foliage. The best plan was to imitate them.\n\nBut before \"retiring to their nest,\" as Paganel said, Glenarvan,\nRobert, and he climbed to the observatory, to examine for the last\ntime the watery expanse. It was about nine o'clock. The sun had just\nset in the sparkling mists of the horizon, and all the western part\nof the firmament was bathed in a warm vapor. The constellations,\nusually so dazzling, seemed veiled in a soft haze. Still they could\nbe distinguished, and Paganel pointed out to Robert, for Glenarvan's\nbenefit, that zone where the stars are most brilliant.\n\n[Sidenote: PHILOSOPHY AND PONCHOS.]\n\nWhile the geographer was discoursing thus, the whole eastern horizon\nassumed a stormy aspect. A dense and dark band, clearly defined,\ngradually rose, dimming the light of the stars. This cloud of\nthreatening appearance soon invaded almost the entire vault of the sky.\nIts motive power must have been inherent in itself, for there was not\na breath of wind. Not a leaf stirred on the tree, not a ripple curled\nthe surface of the waters. Even the air seemed to fail, as if some\nhuge pneumatic machine had rarefied it. A strong electric current was\nperceptible in the atmosphere, and every creature felt it course along\nthe nerves. Glenarvan, Paganel, and Robert were sensibly affected by\nthese electric currents.\n\n\"We shal", "label": "NEUTRAL"}

He turned the words about in every way to draw from them a\nnew meaning, and remained wrapt in these meditations. Thus he did not\nhear Glenarvan's request, and the latter was forced to repeat it.\n\n\"Very well,\" replied Paganel; \"I am ready.\"\n\nSo saying, he mechanically produced his note-book. He tore out a blank\npage, and then, with his pencil in his hand, made ready to write.\nGlenarvan began to dictate the following instructions:\n\n\"Order for Tom Austin to put to sea, and bring the Duncan----\"\n\nPaganel had just finished this last word when his eyes fell upon the\nnumber of the _Australian and New Zealand Gazette_ that lay upon the\nground. The paper, being folded, only allowed him to see the two last\nsyllables of its title. His pencil stopped, and he seemed to completely\nforget Glenarvan and his letter.\n\n\"Well, Paganel?\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\"Ah!\" continued the geographer, uttering a cry.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" asked the major.\n\n\"Nothing! nothing!\" replied Paganel. Then, in a lower tone, he\nrepeated: \"Aland! aland! aland!\"\n\nHe had risen; he had seized the paper. He shook it, seeking to\nrepress words ready to escape his lips. Lady Helena, Mary, Robert,\nand Glenarvan gazed at him without understanding this inexplicable\nagitation. Paganel was like a man whom a sudden frenzy has seized. But\nthis state of nervous excitation did not last. He gradually grew calm.\nThe joy that gleamed in his eyes died away, and, resuming his place, he\nsaid, in a quiet tone:\n\n\"When you wish, my lord, I am at your disposal.\"\n\nGlenarvan continued the dictation of his letter, which was distinctly\nworded as follows:\n\n\"Order for Tom Austin to put to sea, and bring the Duncan to the\neastern coast of Australia.\"\n\n\"Australia?\" cried Paganel. \"Ah, yes, Australia!\"\n\nThe letter was now finished, and presented to Glenarvan for his\nsignature, who, although affected by his recent wound, acquitted\nhimself as well as possible of this formality. The note was then\nfolded and sealed, while Paganel, with a hand that still trembled from\nexcitement, wrote the following address:\n\n                         \"Tom Austin,\n                             \"Mate of the Yacht Duncan,\n                                      \"Melbourne.\"\n\nThereupon he left the cart, gesticulating, and repeating these\nincomprehensible words:\n\n\"Aland! aland! Zealand!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLII.\n\nFOUR DAYS OF ANGUISH.\n\n\nThe rest of the day passed without any other incident. Everything was\nready for the departure of Mulready, who was happy to give his master\nthis proof of his devotion.\n\nPaganel had regained his coolness and accustomed manners. His look\nstill indicated an uneasy state of mind, but he appeared decided to\nkeep his secret. He had doubtless strong reasons for acting thus,\nfor the major overheard him repeating these words, like a man who is\nstruggling with himself:\n\n\"No, no! they would not believe me! And, besides what use is it? It is\ntoo late!\"\n\n[Illustration: \"Adieu, my lord,\" said he, in a calm voice, and soon\ndisappeared by a path along the edge of the wood.]\n\nThis resolution taken, he occupied himself with giving Mulready the\nnecessary directions for reaching Melbourne, and, with the map before\nhim, marked out his course. All the trails of the prairie converged\ntowards the Lucknow road, which, after extending straight southward to\nthe coast, suddenly turned in the direction towards Melbourne. It was\nsimply necessary to follow this, and not attempt to cross the unknown\ncountry. Mulready could not, therefore, go astray. As for dangers, they\nlay only a few miles beyond the encampment, where Ben Joyce and his\nband were probably lying in wait.

Some of the natives, the friends and\npartisans of Kai-Koumou, had stopped suddenly at the command of their\nchief, and had protected the captives.\n\n[Sidenote: THE TORTURES OF SUSPENSE.]\n\nGlenarvan, however, was not blind to the fate that was reserved for\nhim. Only his death could atone for the murder of a chief. Among savage\nraces death is always preceded by a protracted torture. He therefore\nexpected to cruelly expiate the righteous indignation that had nerved\nhis arm, but hoped that Kai-Koumou's rage would fall only on himself.\n\nWhat a night he and his companions passed! Who could depict their\nanguish, or measure their sufferings? Neither poor Robert nor brave\nPaganel had reappeared. But how could they doubt their fate? Were they\nnot the first victims of the natives' vengeance? All hope had vanished\neven from the heart of the major, who did not easily despair. John\nMangles felt himself growing mad at sight of the sad dejection of Mary\nGrant, thus separated from her brother. Glenarvan thought of that\nterrible request of Lady Helena, who, rather than yield to torture or\nslavery, preferred to die by his hand. Could he summon this fearful\ncourage? As for an escape, that was plainly impossible. Ten warriors,\narmed to the teeth, guarded the entrance of the temple.\n\nMorning came at last. There had been no communication between the\nnatives and the prisoners. The hut contained a considerable quantity\nof food, which the unfortunates scarcely touched. Hunger gave place to\ngrief. The day passed without bringing a change or a hope. Doubtless\nthe hour for the dead chief's funeral and their torture would be the\nsame.\n\nHowever, although Glenarvan concluded that Kai-Koumou must have\nabandoned all idea of exchange, the major on this point retained a\ngleam of hope.\n\n\"Who knows,\" said he, reminding Glenarvan of the effect produced upon\nthe chief by the death of Kara-Tété,--\"who knows but that Kai-Koumou in\nreality feels obliged to you?\"\n\nBut, in spite of these observations, Glenarvan would no longer hope.\nThe next day also passed away without the preparations for torture\nbeing made.

He strove to collect a band of\nfollowers, and followed the footsteps of Decesaris and Gasparone, whom\nhe hoped to surpass. Many young men of Palestrina, Frascati, and\nPampinara had disappeared. Their disappearance at first caused much\ndisquietude; but it was soon known that they had joined Cucumetto.\nAfter some time Cucumetto became the object of universal attention; the\nmost extraordinary traits of ferocious daring and brutality were\nrelated of him.\n\n“One day he carried off a young girl, the daughter of a surveyor of\nFrosinone. The bandit’s laws are positive; a young girl belongs first\nto him who carries her off, then the rest draw lots for her, and she is\nabandoned to their brutality until death relieves her sufferings. When\ntheir parents are sufficiently rich to pay a ransom, a messenger is\nsent to negotiate; the prisoner is hostage for the security of the\nmessenger; should the ransom be refused, the prisoner is irrevocably\nlost. The young girl’s lover was in Cucumetto’s troop; his name was\nCarlini. When she recognized her lover, the poor girl extended her arms\nto him, and believed herself safe; but Carlini felt his heart sink, for\nhe but too well knew the fate that awaited her. However, as he was a\nfavorite with Cucumetto, as he had for three years faithfully served\nhim, and as he had saved his life by shooting a dragoon who was about\nto cut him down, he hoped the chief would have pity on him. He took\nCucumetto one side, while the young girl, seated at the foot of a huge\npine that stood in the centre of the forest, made a veil of her\npicturesque head-dress to hide her face from the lascivious gaze of the\nbandits. There he told the chief all—his affection for the prisoner,\ntheir promises of mutual fidelity, and how every night, since he had\nbeen near, they had met in some neighboring ruins.\n\n20109m\n\n\n\n“It so happened that night that Cucumetto had sent Carlini to a\nvillage, so that he had been unable to go to the place of meeting.\nCucumetto had been there, however, by accident, as he said, and had\ncarried the maiden off. Carlini besought his chief to make an exception\nin Rita’s favor, as her father was rich, and could pay a large ransom.\nCucumetto seemed to yield to his friend’s entreaties, and bade him find\na shepherd to send to Rita’s father at Frosinone.\n\n“Carlini flew joyfully to Rita, telling her she was saved, and bidding\nher write to her father, to inform him what had occurred, and that her\nransom was fixed at three hundred piastres. Twelve hours’ delay was all\nthat was granted—that is, until nine the next morning. The instant the\nletter was written, Carlini seized it, and hastened to the plain to\nfind a messenger. He found a young shepherd watching his flock. The\nnatural messengers of the bandits are the shepherds who live between\nthe city and the mountains, between civilized and savage life. The boy\nundertook the commission, promising to be in Frosinone in less than an\nhour. Carlini returned, anxious to see his mistress, and announce the\njoyful intelligence. He found the troop in the glade, supping off the\nprovisions exacted as contributions from the peasants; but his eye\nvainly sought Rita and Cucumetto among them.\n\n“He inquired where they were, and was answered by a burst of laughter.\nA cold perspiration burst from every pore, and his hair stood on end.\nHe repeated his question. One of the bandits rose, and offered him a\nglass filled with Orvietto, saying, ‘To the health of the brave\nCucumetto and the fair Rita.’ At this moment Carlini heard a woman’s\ncry; he divined the truth, seized the glass, broke it across the face\nof him who presented it, and rushed towards the spot whence the cry\ncame. After a hundred yards he turned the corner of the thicket; he\nfound Rita senseless in the arms of Cucumetto. At the sight of Carlini,\nCucumetto rose, a pistol in each hand.

Welcome, welcome! I am almost a\nFrenchman,\" cried the commander, shaking the geographer's arm with\nrather painful violence.]\n\n[Sidenote: RAISING A REGIMENT.]\n\nHe then entered into conversation with the commander. Glenarvan would\ngladly have put in a word in regard to his affairs, but the soldier\nwas telling his story, and was not in the mood to be interrupted.\nThis honest man had left France a long time before; and the native\nlanguage was no longer perfectly familiar to him: he had forgotten,\nif not words, at least the manner of combining them. As his visitors\nsoon learned, he had been a sergeant in the French army. Since the\nfoundation of the fort he had not left it, and commanded it by\nappointment from the Argentine government. He was by parentage a\nBasque, and his name was Manuel Ipharaguerre. A year after his arrival\nin the country, Sergeant Manuel was naturalized, joined the Argentine\narmy, and married an honest Indian woman, who had twins,--boys, to be\nsure, for the sergeant's worthy consort would never present him with\ndaughters. Manuel did not think of any other calling than that of the\nsoldier, and hoped, in time, with the help of God, to offer to the\nrepublic a whole battalion of young soldiers.\n\n\"You have seen them?\" said he. \"Charming fellows! Good soldiers! José!\nJuan! Miguel! Pepe! Pepe is only seven years old, and is already biting\nhis cartridge!\"\n\nPepe, hearing himself complimented, joined his two little feet, and\npresented arms with perfect precision.\n\n\"He will do!\" added the sergeant. \"He will be a major--or\nbrigadier-general one day!\"\n\nThis story lasted a quarter of an hour, to Thalcave's great\nastonishment. The Indian could not understand how so many words could\ncome from a single throat. No one interrupted the commander; and even\na French sergeant had to conclude at last, though not without forcing\nhis guests to accompany him to his dwelling. Here they were introduced\nto Madame Ipharaguerre, who appeared to be \"a good-looking person,\" if\nthis expression may be employed in regard to an Indian.\n\nWhen he had exhausted himself, the sergeant asked his guests to what he\nowed the honor of their visit. And now it was their turn to explain.\n\nPaganel, opening the conversation in French, told him of their journey\nacross the Pampas, and ended by asking why the Indians had abandoned\nthe country.\n\n\"War!\" replied the sergeant.\n\n\"War?\"\n\n\"Yes, civil war.\"\n\n\"Civil war?\" rejoined Paganel.\n\n\"Yes, war between Paraguay and Buenos Ayres,\" answered the sergeant.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Why, all the Indians of the north are in the rear of General Flores,\nand those of the plains are plundering.\"\n\n\"But the caziques?\"\n\n\"The caziques with them.\"\n\nThis answer was reported to Thalcave, who shook his head. Indeed,\nhe either did not know, or had forgotten, that a civil war, which\nwas afterwards to involve Brazil, was decimating two-thirds of the\nrepublic. The Indians had everything to gain in these internal\nstruggles, and could not neglect such fine opportunities for plunder.\nThe sergeant, therefore, was not mistaken in attributing this desertion\nof the Pampas to the civil war that was being waged in the northern\npart of the Argentine Provinces.\n\nBut this event disconcerted Glenarvan's hopes. If Captain Grant was\na prisoner of the caziques, he must have been carried by them to the\nnorthern frontiers. Yet how and where to find him? Must they attempt\na perilous and almost useless search to the northern limits of the\nPampas? It was a serious matter, which was to be earnestly considered.\n\nHowever, one important question was still to be asked of the sergeant,\nand the major thought of this, while his companions were looking at\neach other in silence.\n\n\"Hav", "label": "SUPPORT"}

Villefort\nretired to his study, and d’Avrigny left to summon the doctor of the\nmayoralty, whose office it is to examine bodies after decease, and who\nis expressly named “the doctor of the dead.” M. Noirtier could not be\npersuaded to quit his grandchild. At the end of a quarter of an hour M.\nd’Avrigny returned with his associate; they found the outer gate\nclosed, and not a servant remaining in the house; Villefort himself was\nobliged to open to them. But he stopped on the landing; he had not the\ncourage to again visit the death chamber. The two doctors, therefore,\nentered the room alone. Noirtier was near the bed, pale, motionless,\nand silent as the corpse. The district doctor approached with the\nindifference of a man accustomed to spend half his time amongst the\ndead; he then lifted the sheet which was placed over the face, and just\nunclosed the lips.\n\n“Alas,” said d’Avrigny, “she is indeed dead, poor child!”\n\n50099m\n\n\n\n“Yes,” answered the doctor laconically, dropping the sheet he had\nraised. Noirtier uttered a kind of hoarse, rattling sound; the old\nman’s eyes sparkled, and the good doctor understood that he wished to\nbehold his child. He therefore approached the bed, and while his\ncompanion was dipping the fingers with which he had touched the lips of\nthe corpse in chloride of lime, he uncovered the calm and pale face,\nwhich looked like that of a sleeping angel.\n\nA tear, which appeared in the old man’s eye, expressed his thanks to\nthe doctor. The doctor of the dead then laid his permit on the corner\nof the table, and having fulfilled his duty, was conducted out by\nd’Avrigny. Villefort met them at the door of his study; having in a few\nwords thanked the district doctor, he turned to d’Avrigny, and said:\n\n“And now the priest.”\n\n“Is there any particular priest you wish to pray with Va", "label": "CONTRADICT"}

A few moments after\nthey were led back to the temple that served as their prison; but\nRobert Grant and Paganel were no longer with them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER L.\n\nTHE CHIEF'S FUNERAL.\n\n\nKai-Koumou, according to a custom quite ordinary in New Zealand, joined\nthe rank of priest to that of chief, and could, therefore, extend to\npersons or objects the superstitious protection of the taboo.\n\nThe taboo, which is common to the tribes of Polynesia, has the power\nto prohibit at once all connection with the object or person tabooed.\nAccording to the Maori religion, whoever should lay his sacrilegious\nhand on what is declared taboo would be punished with death by the\noffended god; and in case the divinity should delay to avenge his own\ninsult, the priests would not fail to excite his anger.\n\nAs for the prisoners confined in the temple, the taboo had rescued\nthem from the fury of the tribe. Some of the natives, the friends and\npartisans of Kai-Koumou, had stopped suddenly at the command of their\nchief, and had protected the captives.\n\n[Sidenote: THE TORTURES OF SUSPENSE.]\n\nGlenarvan, however, was not blind to the fate that was reserved for\nhim. Only his death could atone for the murder of a chief. Among savage\nraces death is always preceded by a protracted torture. He therefore\nexpected to cruelly expiate the righteous indignation that had nerved\nhis arm, but hoped that Kai-Koumou's rage would fall only on himself.\n\nWhat a night he and his companions passed! Who could depict their\nanguish, or measure their sufferings? Neither poor Robert nor brave\nPaganel had reappeared. But how could they doubt their fate? Were they\nnot the first victims of the natives' vengeance? All hope had vanished\neven from the heart of the major, who did not easily despair. John\nMangles felt himself growing mad at sight of the sad dejection of Mary\nGrant, thus separated from her brother. Glenarvan thought of that\nterrible request of Lady Helena, who, rather than yield to torture or\nslavery, preferred to die by his hand. Could he summon this fearful\ncourage? As for an escape, that was plainly impossible. Ten warriors,\narmed to the teeth, guarded the entrance of the temple.\n\nMorning came at last. There had been no communication between the\nnatives and the prisoners. The hut contained a considerable quantity\nof food, which the unfortunates scarcely touched. Hunger gave place to\ngrief. The day passed without bringing a change or a hope. Doubtless\nthe hour for the dead chief's funeral and their torture would be the\nsame.\n\nHowever, although Glenarvan concluded that Kai-Koumou must have\nabandoned all idea of exchange, the major on this point retained a\ngleam of hope.\n\n\"Who knows,\" said he, reminding Glenarvan of the effect produced upon\nthe chief by the death of Kara-Tété,--\"who knows but that Kai-Koumou in\nreality feels obliged to you?\"\n\nBut, in spite of these observations, Glenarvan would no longer hope.\nThe next day also passed away without the preparations for torture\nbeing made. The reason of the delay was this.\n\nThe Maoris believe that the soul, for three days after death, inhabits\nthe body of the deceased, and therefore during this time the corpse\nremains unburied. This custom was rigorously observed, and for two days\nthe pah was deserted. Captain Mangles frequently stood on Wilson's\nshoulders and surveyed the fortification. No native was seen; only the\nsentinels guarded in turn at the door of their prison.\n\nBut on the third day the huts were opened. The savages, men, women,\nand children, to the number of several hundreds, assembled in the pah,\nsilent and calm. Kai-Koumou came out of his house, and, surrounded by\nthe principal warriors of his tribe, took his place on a mound several\nfeet high in the centre of the fortification.

But\nCaptain Mangles had promised to watch over him, a fact which tended not\na little to allay Miss Grant's apprehension for her brother's safety.\n\nOf all the sports of the day the most interesting was unquestionably\na kangaroo hunt. About four o'clock the dogs started a troop of these\ncurious animals. The little ones took refuge in their mothers' pouches,\nand the whole drove rushed away in single file. Nothing can be more\nastonishing than the enormous bounds of the kangaroo, whose hind legs\nare twice as long as its fore ones, and bend like a spring. At the head\nof the drove was a male five feet high,--\"an old man,\" in the language\nof the bushmen.\n\nFor four or five miles the chase was briskly continued. The kangaroos\ndid not slacken their pace; and the dogs, who feared, with good reason,\nthe powerful blows of their formidable paws, did not venture to\napproach them. But at last the drove stopped in exhaustion, and \"the\nold man\" braced himself against the trunk of a tree, ready to fight\nfor his life. One of the pointers, carried on by the impetus of his\ncourse, rolled within reach of him. A moment after, the unfortunate\ndog was tossed into the air, and fell back lifeless. The entire pack,\ndeterred by the fate of their comrade, kept at a respectful distance.\nIt became necessary to dispatch the kangaroo with the rifle, and\nnothing but bullets could bring down the gigantic quadruped.\n\nAt this juncture Robert narrowly escaped being the victim of his\nrashness. In order to make sure of his aim, he approached so near the\nkangaroo that the animal made a spring at him. Robert fell. A cry of\nalarm resounded. Mary Grant, speechless with apprehension, stretched\nher hands towards her brother. No one dared to fire, for fear of\nhitting the boy.\n\nSuddenly Captain Mangles, with his hunting-knife open, rushed upon the\nkangaroo, at the risk of his life, and stabbed it to the heart. The\nbeast fell dead, and Robert rose unharmed. An instant after, he was in\nthe arms of his sister.\n\n\"Thanks, Captain Mangles! thanks!\" said Mary, extending her hand to the\nyoung captain.\n\n\"I promised to take care of him,\" replied the captain, as he took the\ntrembling hand of the young girl.\n\nThis adventure ended the hunt. The troop of kangaroos had scattered\nafter the death of their leader, whose carcass was brought to the house.\n\nIt was now six o'clock, and dinner was in readiness for the hunters;\ncomprising, among other dishes, a soup of kangaroo's tail, prepared in\nthe native style.\n\nAfter a dessert of ices and sherbet, the party repaired to the parlor,\nwhere the evening was devoted to music. Lady Helena, who was a good\npianiste, presided at the instrument, while Michael and Alexander\nPatterson sang with great taste selections from the latest compositions\nof the modern musical masters.\n\n[Sidenote: A FRESH DEPARTURE.]\n\nAt eleven o'clock tea was served in true English style. Paganel\nhaving desired to taste the Australian tea, a liquid, black as ink,\nwas brought to him. It consisted of a quart of water, in which half\na pound of tea had been boiled four hours. Paganel, with a wry face,\npronounced it excellent. At midnight the guests were conducted to cool\nand comfortable chambers, where they renewed in dreams the pleasures of\nthe day.\n\nThe next morning, at sunrise, they took leave of the two young\nsettlers, with many thanks, and with warmly-expressed hopes to see them\nat Malcolm Castle at no very distant day.

Aided by the\nparliament of South Australia, he likewise proceeded northward,\nin the year 1862, about seven degrees to the west of the line taken\nby Burke.

His return to the inhabited regions was successfully\naccomplished, and his entry into Adelaide, on the 17th of December, was\nan ovation indeed. But his health was shattered, and, after receiving\nthe gold medal of the Royal Geographical Society, and returning to his\nnative Scotland, he died on the 5th of June, 1866.\n\n[Illustration: He beheld the waters of the Indian Ocean, and proudly\nunfurled the Australian flag from the topmost branch of the highest\ntree he could find.]\n\nThe histories of these Australian travels were lengthy, as told by\nPaganel.

Their freedom from all\nbonds showed that they would meet death unresistingly. Moreover, this\ndeath was rapid, protracted sufferings were spared them. These were\nreserved for the captives who stood trembling not twenty paces distant.\nSix blows of the méré, given by six stalwart warriors, stretched the\nvictims on the ground in a pool of blood. It was the signal for a\nterrible scene of cannibalism, which followed in all its horrible\ndetails.\n\nGlenarvan and his companions, breathless with fright, strove to hide\nthis awful scene from the eyes of the two unhappy ladies. They now\nunderstood what awaited them at sunrise the next day, and what cruel\ntortures would doubtless precede such a death. They were dumb with\nhorror.\n\nThe funeral dance now began.

The\nlimpid waters of Loch Lomond bathe the granite of its walls. From time\nimmemorial it has belonged to the Glenarvan family, who have preserved\nin the country of Rob Roy and Fergus MacGregor the hospitable customs\nof the ancient heroes of Walter Scott. At the epoch of the social\nrevolution in Scotland, a great number of vassals were expelled,\nbecause they could not pay the great rents to the ancient chiefs\nof the clans. Some died of hunger, others became fishermen, others\nemigrated. There was general despair.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nAmong all these the Glenarvans alone believed that fidelity bound the\nhigh as well as the low, and they remained faithful to their tenants.\nNot one left the roof under which he was born; not one abandoned the\nsoil where his ancestors reposed; all continued in the clan of their\nancient lords. Thus at this epoch, in this age of disaffection and\ndisunion, the Glenarvan family considered the Scots at Malcolm Castle\nas their own people. All were descended from the vassals of their\nkinsmen; were children of the counties of Stirling and Dumbarton, and\nhonestly devoted, body and estate, to their master.\n\nLord Glenarvan possessed an immense fortune, which he employed in\ndoing much good. His kindness exceeded even his generosity, for one\nwas boundless, while the other was necessarily limited. The lord of\nLuss, the \"laird\" of Malcolm, represented his fellows in the House of\nLords; but with true Scottish ideas, little pleasing to the southrons,\nhe was disliked by many of them especially because he adhered to the\ntraditions of his ancestors, and energetically opposed some dicta of\nmodern political economy.\n\nHe was not, however, a backward man, either in wit or shrewdness; but\nwhile ready to enter every door of progress, he remained Scotch at\nheart, and it was for the glory of his native land that he contended\nwith his racing yachts in the matches of the Royal Thames Yacht Club.\n\nLord Edward Glenarvan was thirty-two years old. His form was erect and\nhis features sharp, but his look was mild, and his character thoroughly\nimbued with the poetry of the Highlands. He was known to be brave to\nexcess, enterprising, chivalrous, a Fergus of the nineteenth century;\nbut good above all, better than Saint Martin himself, for he would have\ngiven his very cloak to the poor people of the Highlands.\n\nHe had been married scarcely three months, having espoused Miss Helena\nTuffnel, daughter of the great traveler, William Tuffnel, one of the\nnumerous victims to the great passion for geographical discoveries.\n\nMiss Helena did not belong to a noble family, but she was Scotch, which\nequaled all nobilities in the eyes of Lord Glenarvan. This charming\nyoung creature, high-minded and devoted, the lord of Luss had made the\ncompanion of his life. He found her one day living alone, an orphan,\nalmost without fortune, in the house of her father at Kilpatrick. He\nsaw that the poor girl would make a noble wife, and he married her.\n\nMiss Tuffnel was twenty-two, a youthful blonde, with eyes as blue as\nthe waters of the Scotch lakes on a beautiful morning in spring. Her\nlove for her husband exceeded even her gratitude. She loved him as if\nshe had been the rich heiress, and he the friendless orphan.

What,\nmoreover, could ten defenceless men do against thirty well-armed\nsavages? Besides, Glenarvan thought it likely that Kai-Koumou's tribe\nhad lost some chief of high rank whom they were particularly anxious to\nrecover; and he was not mistaken.\n\nThe next day the canoe ascended the river with increased swiftness.\nIt stopped for a moment at the junction of a small river which wound\nacross the plains on the right bank. Here another canoe, with ten\nnatives on board, joined Kai-Koumou. The warriors merely exchanged\nsalutations, and then continued their course. The new-comers had\nrecently fought against the English troops, as could be seen by their\ntattered garments, their gory weapons, and the wounds that still bled\nbeneath their rags. They were gloomy and taciturn, and, with the\nindifference common to all savage races, paid no attention to the\ncaptives.\n\nTowards evening Kai-Koumou landed at the foot of the mountains,\nwhose nearer ridges reached precipitously to the river-bank. Here\ntwenty natives, who had disembarked from their canoes, were making\npreparations for the night. Fires blazed beneath the trees. A chief,\nequal in rank to Kai-Koumou, advanced with measured pace, and, rubbing\nhis nose against that of the latter, saluted him cordially. The\nprisoners were stationed in the centre of the encampment, and guarded\nwith extreme vigilance.\n\nThe next morning the ascent of the Waikato was resumed. Other boats\ncame from various affluents of the river. Sixty warriors, evidently\nfugitives from the last insurrection, had now assembled, and were\nreturning, more or less wounded in the fray, to the mountain districts.\nSometimes a song arose from the canoes, as they advanced in single\nfile. One native struck up the patriotic ode of the mysterious \"Pihé,\"\nthe national hymn that calls the Maoris to battle. The full and\nsonorous voice of the singer waked the echoes of the mountains; and\nafter each stanza his comrades struck their breasts, and sang the\nwarlike verses in chorus. Then they seized their oars again, and the\ncanoes were headed up stream.\n\nDuring the day a singular sight enlivened the voyage. About four\no'clock the canoe, without lessening its speed, guided by the steady\nhand of the chief, dashed through a narrow gorge. Eddies broke\nviolently against numerous small islands, which rendered navigation\nexceeding dangerous. Never could it be more hazardous to capsize, for\nthe banks afforded no refuge, and whoever had set foot on the porous\ncrust of the shore would probably have perished. At this point the\nriver flowed between warm springs, oxide of iron colored the muddy\nground a brilliant red, and not a yard of firm earth could be seen.\nThe air was heavy with a penetrating sulphureous odor. The natives did\nnot regard it, but the captives were seriously annoyed by the noxious\nvapors exhaled from the fissures of the soil and the bubbles that\nburst and discharged their gaseous contents. Yet, however disagreeable\nthese emanations were, the eye could not but admire this magnificent\nspectacle.\n\n[Illustration: At this point the river flowed between warm springs, and\nnot a yard of firm earth could be seen.]\n\nThe canoes soon after entered a dense cloud of white smoke, whose\nwreaths rose in gradually decreasing circles above the river. On the\nshores a hundred geysers, some shooting forth masses of vapor, and\nothers overflowing in liquid columns, varied their effects, like the\njets and cascades of a fountain. It seemed as though some engineer was\ndirecting at his pleasure the outflowings of these springs, as the\nwaters and vapor, mingling in the air, formed rainbows in the sunbeams.\n\nFor two miles the canoes glided within this vapory atmosphere,\nenveloped in its warm waves that rolled along the surface of the water.\nThen the sulphureous smoke disappeared, and a pure swift current of\nfresh air refreshed the panting voyagers.

As soon as Paganel's proposal was accepted, he at once resolved\nthat the preparations for the journey should be completed as soon as\npossible.\n\nAnd what was to be the result of this search? The existence of\nHarry Grant seemed to have become undeniable, which increased the\nprobabilities of success. No one expected to find the captain exactly\non the line of the thirty-seventh parallel; but perhaps they would come\nupon traces of him, and, at all events, their course would bring them\nstraight to the scene of the shipwreck, which was the principal point.\n\nMoreover, if Ayrton would consent to join the travelers, to guide them\nthrough the forests, and to the eastern coast, there was another chance\nof success. Glenarvan felt the importance of this arrangement, and was\ntherefore particularly desirous of obtaining the services of Captain\nGrant's companion. He inquired of his host whether he was willing for\nhim to propose to Ayrton to accompany them.

Noirtier—for it was, indeed, he who entered—looked after the servant\nuntil the door was closed, and then, fearing, no doubt, that he might\nbe overheard in the antechamber, he opened the door again, nor was the\nprecaution useless, as appeared from the rapid retreat of Germain, who\nproved that he was not exempt from the sin which ruined our first\nparents. M. Noirtier then took the trouble to close and bolt the\nantechamber door, then that of the bedchamber, and then extended his\nhand to Villefort, who had followed all his motions with surprise which\nhe could not conceal.\n\n“Well, now, my dear Gérard,” said he to the young man, with a very\nsignificant look, “do you know, you seem as if you were not very glad\nto see me?”\n\n“My dear father,” said Villefort, “I am, on the contrary, delighted;\nbut I so little expected your visit, that it has somewhat overcome me.”\n\n“But, my dear fellow,” replied M.

Yes, I heard this news, and knew it even before you could; for\nthree days ago I posted from Marseilles to Paris with all possible\nspeed, half-desperate at the enforced delay.”\n\n“Three days ago? You are crazy. Why, three days ago the emperor had not\nlanded.”\n\n“No matter, I was aware of his intention.”\n\n“How did you know about it?”\n\n“By a letter addressed to you from the Island of Elba.”\n\n“To me?”\n\n“To you; and which I discovered in the pocket-book of the messenger.\nHad that letter fallen into the hands of another, you, my dear father,\nwould probably ere this have been shot.” Villefort’s father laughed.\n\n“Come, come,” said he, “will the Restoration adopt imperial methods so\npromptly?

I know you too well to suppose you would allow such a thing\nto pass you.”\n\n“I burnt it, for fear that even a fragment should remain; for that\nletter must have led to your condemnation.”\n\n“And the destruction of your future prospects,” replied Noirtier; “yes,\nI can easily comprehend that.

He allowed this bloody orgy an hour to reach its utmost\nintensity. The last act of the funeral was played with the usual rites.\n\nThe bodies of Kara-Tété and his wife were taken up, and their limbs\nbent and gathered against the stomach, according to the New Zealand\ncustom. The place for the tomb had been chosen outside of the\nfortification, about two miles distant, on the summit of a small\nmountain, called Maunganamu, situated on the right shore of the lake.\n\nThither the bodies were to be carried. Two very rude palanquins, or\nrather litters, were brought to the foot of the mound. The corpses,\nfolded together, in a sitting posture, and tied in their clothes by a\ngirdle of withes, were placed on this primitive bier. Four warriors\nbore it between them, and the entire tribe, chanting the funeral hymn,\nfollowed them in procession to the place of burial.\n\nThe captives, who were always watched, saw them leave the inner\ninclosure of the pah, and then the songs and cries gradually died away.\nFor about half an hour this funeral escort continued in sight, in the\ndepths of the valley. Finally they perceived it again winding along\nthe mountain paths. The distance gave a fantastic appearance to the\nundulating movements of the long, sinuous column.\n\nThe tribe stopped at the summit of the mountain, which was eight\nhundred feet high, at the place prepared for Kara-Tété's interment.\nA common Maori would have had only a hole and a heap of stones for a\ngrave; but for a powerful and dreaded chief, destined doubtless for a\nspeedy deification, a tomb worthy of his exploits was reserved.\n\n[Sidenote: THE LAST NIGHT.]\n\nThe sepulchre had been surrounded by palisades, while stakes,\nornamented with faces reddened with ochre, stood beside the grave\nwhere the bodies were to lie. The relatives had not forgotten that the\n\"waidoua\" (the spirit of the dead) feeds on substantial nourishment\nlike the body during this perishable life. Food had therefore been\ndeposited in the inclosure, together with the weapons and clothes of\nthe deceased.\n\nNothing was wanting for the comfort of the tomb. Husband and wife were\nlaid side by side, and then covered with earth and grass after a series\nof renewed lamentations. Then the procession silently descended the\nmountain, and now no one could ascend it under penalty of death, for it\nwas tabooed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LI.\n\nSTRANGELY LIBERATED.\n\n\nJust as the sun was disappearing behind Lake Taupo, the captives were\nled back to their prison.

Morrel,” replied Villefort. “The order of\nimprisonment came from high authority, and the order for his liberation\nmust proceed from the same source; and, as Napoleon has scarcely been\nreinstated a fortnight, the letters have not yet been forwarded.”\n\n“But,” said Morrel, “is there no way of expediting all these\nformalities—of releasing him from arrest?”\n\n“There has been no arrest.”\n\n“How?”\n\n“It is sometimes essential to government to cause a man’s disappearance\nwithout leaving any traces, so that no written forms or documents may\ndefeat their wishes.”\n\n“It might be so under the Bourbons, but at present——”\n\n“It has always been so, my dear Morrel, since the reign of Louis XIV.\nThe emperor is more strict in prison discipline than even Louis\nhimself, and the number of prisoners whose names are not on the\nregister is incalculable.” Had Morrel even any suspicions, so much\nkindness would have dispelled them.\n\n“Well, M. de Villefort, how would you advise me to act?” asked he.\n\n“Petition the minister.”\n\n“Oh, I know what that is; the minister receives two hundred petitions\nevery day, and does not read three.”\n\n“That is true; but he will read a petition countersigned and presented\nby me.”\n\n“And will you undertake to deliver it?”\n\n“With the greatest pleasure. Dantès was then guilty, and now he is\ninnocent, and it is as much my duty to free him as it was to condemn\nhim.” Villefort thus forestalled any danger of an inquiry, which,\nhowever improbable it might be, if it did take place would leave him\ndefenceless.\n\n“But how shall I address the minister?”\n\n“Sit down there,” said Villefort, giving up his place to Morrel, “and\nwrite what I dictate.”\n\n“Will you be so good?”\n\n“Certainly. But lose no time; we have lost too much already.”\n\n“That is true. Only think what the poor fellow may even now be\nsuffering.”\n\nVillefort shuddered at the suggestion; but he had gone too far to draw\nback. Dantès must be crushed to gratify Villefort’s ambition.\n\nVillefort dictated a petition, in which, from an excellent intention,\nno doubt, Dantès’ patriotic services were exaggerated, and he was made\nout one of the most active agents of Napoleon’s return. It was evident\nthat at the sight of this document the minister would instantly release\nhim. The petition finished, Villefort read it aloud.\n\n“That will do,” said he; “leave the rest to me.”\n\n“Will the petition go soon?”\n\n“Today.”\n\n“Countersigned by you?”\n\n“The best thing I can do will be to certify the truth of the contents\nof your petition.” And, sitting down, Villefort wrote the certificate\nat the bottom.\n\n“What more is to be done?”\n\n“I will do whatever is necessary.” This assurance delighted Morrel, who\ntook leave of Villefort, and hastened to announce to old Dantès that he\nwould soon see his son.\n\nAs for Villefort, instead of sending to Paris, he carefully preserved\nthe petition that so fearfully compromised Dantès, in the hopes of an\nevent that seemed not unlikely,—that is, a second restoration. Dantès\nremained a prisoner, and heard not the noise of the fall of Louis\nXVIII.’s throne, or the still more tragic destruction of the empire.\n\nTwice during the Hundred Days had Morrel renewed his demand, and twice\nhad Villefort soothed him with promises. At last there was Waterloo,\nand Morrel came no more; he had done all that was in his power, and any\nfresh attempt would only compromise himself uselessly.\n\nLouis XVIII. remounted the throne; Villefort, to whom Marseilles had\nbecome filled with remorseful memories, sought and obtained the\nsituation of king’s procureur at Toulouse, and a fortnight afterwards\nhe married Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran, whose father now stood higher\nat court than ever.\n\nAnd so Dantès, after the Hundred Days and after Waterloo, remained in\nhis dungeon, forgotten of earth and heaven.\n\nDanglars comprehended the full extent of the wretched fate that\noverwhelmed Dantès; and, when Napoleon retu", "label": "CONTRADICT"}

What,\nmoreover, could ten defenceless men do against thirty well-armed\nsavages? Besides, Glenarvan thought it likely that Kai-Koumou's tribe\nhad lost some chief of high rank whom they were particularly anxious to\nrecover; and he was not mistaken.\n\nThe next day the canoe ascended the river with increased swiftness.\nIt stopped for a moment at the junction of a small river which wound\nacross the plains on the right bank. Here another canoe, with ten\nnatives on board, joined Kai-Koumou. The warriors merely exchanged\nsalutations, and then continued their course. The new-comers had\nrecently fought against the English troops, as could be seen by their\ntattered garments, their gory weapons, and the wounds that still bled\nbeneath their rags. They were gloomy and taciturn, and, with the\nindifference common to all savage races, paid no attention to the\ncaptives.\n\nTowards evening Kai-Koumou landed at the foot of the mountains,\nwhose nearer ridges reached precipitously to the river-bank. Here\ntwenty natives, who had disembarked from their canoes, were making\npreparations for the night. Fires blazed beneath the trees. A chief,\nequal in rank to Kai-Koumou, advanced with measured pace, and, rubbing\nhis nose against that of the latter, saluted him cordially. The\nprisoners were stationed in the centre of the encampment, and guarded\nwith extreme vigilance.\n\nThe next morning the ascent of the Waikato was resumed. Other boats\ncame from various affluents of the river. Sixty warriors, evidently\nfugitives from the last insurrection, had now assembled, and were\nreturning, more or less wounded in the fray, to the mountain districts.\nSometimes a song arose from the canoes, as they advanced in single\nfile. One native struck up the patriotic ode of the mysterious \"Pihé,\"\nthe national hymn that calls the Maoris to battle. The full and\nsonorous voice of the singer waked the echoes of the mountains; and\nafter each stanza his comrades struck their breasts, and sang the\nwarlike verses in chorus. Then they seized their oars again, and the\ncanoes were headed up stream.\n\nDuring the day a singular sight enlivened the voyage. About four\no'clock the canoe, without lessening its speed, guided by the steady\nhand of the chief, dashed through a narrow gorge. Eddies broke\nviolently against numerous small islands, which rendered navigation\nexceeding dangerous. Never could it be more hazardous to capsize, for\nthe banks afforded no refuge, and whoever had set foot on the porous\ncrust of the shore would probably have perished. At this point the\nriver flowed between warm springs, oxide of iron colored the muddy\nground a brilliant red, and not a yard of firm earth could be seen.\nThe air was heavy with a penetrating sulphureous odor. The natives did\nnot regard it, but the captives were seriously annoyed by the noxious\nvapors exhaled from the fissures of the soil and the bubbles that\nburst and discharged their gaseous contents. Yet, however disagreeable\nthese emanations were, the eye could not but admire this magnificent\nspectacle.\n\n[Illustration: At this point the river flowed between warm springs, and\nnot a yard of firm earth could be seen.]\n\nThe canoes soon after entered a dense cloud of white smoke, whose\nwreaths rose in gradually decreasing circles above the river. On the\nshores a hundred geysers, some shooting forth masses of vapor, and\nothers overflowing in liquid columns, varied their effects, like the\njets and cascades of a fountain. It seemed as though some engineer was\ndirecting at his pleasure the outflowings of these springs, as the\nwaters and vapor, mingling in the air, formed rainbows in the sunbeams.\n\nFor two miles the canoes glided within this vapory atmosphere,\nenveloped in its warm waves that rolled along the surface of the water.\nThen the sulphureous smoke disappeared, and a pure swift current of\nfresh air refreshed the panting voyagers.

The stakes of the hut groaned, the fire of the natives suddenly\nrevived at this passing draught, and the flames cast rapid flashes\ninto the temple, illumining for a moment the group of prisoners. These\npoor people were absorbed with their last thoughts; a deathly silence\nreigned in the hut.\n\nIt must have been about four o'clock in the morning, when the major's\nattention was attracted by a slight sound that seemed to come from\nbehind the rear stakes, in the back wall that lay towards the rock. At\nfirst he was indifferent to the noise, but finding that it continued,\nhe listened. At last, puzzled by its persistence, he put his ear close\nto the ground to hear better. It seemed as if some one was scraping and\ndigging outside.\n\nWhen he was certain of this fact, he passed quietly towards Glenarvan\nand the captain, and led them to the rear of the hut.\n\n\"Listen,\" said he, in a low voice, motioning to them to bend down.\n\nThe scrapings became more and more audible.

But they were motionless around the fire, and did not suspect what\nwas transpiring twenty paces from them.\n\nThe soil was loose and crumbling, and lay upon a bed of clay, so that,\nin spite of the want of tools, the hole rapidly enlarged. It was soon\nevident that somebody, clinging to the sides of the pah, was making a\npassage in its outer wall. What could be the object? Did he know of the\nexistence of the prisoners, or could a mere chance attempt at escape\nexplain the work that seemed nearly completed?\n\n[Sidenote: HEAVENLY HELP FROM AN EARTHLY HAND.]\n\nThe captives redoubled their efforts.

They could perceive by the\nsounds, which were now more distinct, that only a thin layer of earth\nprevented immediate communication.\n\nA few moments more elapsed, when suddenly the major drew back his hand,\nwhich was cut by a sharp blade. He suppressed a cry that was about to\nescape him. Captain Mangles, holding out his poniard, avoided the knife\nthat was moving out of the ground, but seized the hand that held it.\nIt was the hand of a woman or a youth, a European hand. Not a word had\nbeen uttered on either side. There was plainly an object in keeping\nsilent.\n\n\"Is it Robert?\" murmured Glenarvan.\n\nBut, though only whispering this name, Mary Grant, awakened by the\nmovement that was taking place in the hut, glided towards Glenarvan,\nand, seizing this hand all soiled with mud, covered it with kisses.\n\n\"It is you! it is you!\" cried the young girl, who could not be\nmistaken, \"you, my Robert!\"\n\n\"Yes, little sister,\" replied Robert, \"I am here to save you all!

A strong electric current was\nperceptible in the atmosphere, and every creature felt it course along\nthe nerves.

The mass of\nclouds now covered it entirely. A faint line of light towards the\nhorizon was scarcely discernible in the dimness. The sombre appearance\nof the water had increased, and between the dark mass below and the\nclouds above there was scarcely a separation. At the same time all\nperception seemed dulled; and a leaden torpor rested upon both eyes and\nears, while the silence was profound.\n\n\"Let us go down,\" said Glenarvan; \"the lightning will soon be here.\"\n\nHis two companions and himself slid down the smooth branches, and were\nsomewhat surprised to find themselves in a remarkable kind of twilight,\nwhich was produced by myriads of luminous objects that crossed each\nother and buzzed on the surface of the water.\n\n\"Phosphorescences?\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\"No,\" replied Paganel, \"but phosphorescent insects, real\nglow-worms,--living diamonds, and not expensive, of which the ladies of\nBuenos Ayres make magnificent ornaments for themselves.\"\n\n\"What!\" cried Robert, \"are these things, that fly like sparks, insects?\"\n\n\"Yes, my boy.\"\n\nRobert caught one of the brilliant creatures. Paganel was right. It\nwas a kind of large beetle, an inch in length, to which the Indians\ngive the name of \"tuco-tuco.\" This curious insect threw out flashes at\ntwo points situated in front of its sheath, and its light would have\nenabled one to read in the darkness. Paganel, on bringing it close to\nhis watch, saw that it was ten o'clock.\n\nGlenarvan now joined the major and the three sailors, and gave them\ninstructions for the night. A terrible storm was to be expected. After\nthe first rollings of the thunder, the wind would doubtless break forth\nand the tree be violently shaken.

Paganel, whose\nchangeable disposition carried him from one extreme to another, had\nregained his hopefulness. He believed that the Maoris were sparing them\nthe fatigue of their journey to the English settlements, and that they\nwere certain to arrive at their destination. He was, therefore, quite\nresigned to his lot, and traced on his map the course of the Waikato\nacross the plains and valleys of the province. Lady Helena and Mary\nGrant, suppressing their terror, conversed in low tones with Glenarvan,\nand the most skillful physiognomist could not have detected on their\nfaces the anxiety of their hearts.\n\nThe Waikato River is worshiped by the natives, as Paganel knew, and\nEnglish and German naturalists have never ascended beyond its junction\nwith the Waipa. Whither did Kai-Koumou intend to take his captives?\nThe geographer could not have guessed if the word \"Taupo,\" frequently\nrepeated, had not attracted his attention. By consulting his map,\nhe saw that this name was applied to a celebrated lake in the most\nmountainous part of the island, and that from it the Waikato flows.\n\nPaganel, addressing Captain Mangles in French, so as not to be\nunderstood by the savages, asked him how fast the canoe was going. The\ncaptain thought about three miles an hour.\n\n\"Then,\" replied the geographer, \"if we do not travel during the night,\nour voyage to the lake will last about four days.\"\n\n\"But whereabouts are the English garrisons?\" asked Glenarvan.\n\n\"It is difficult to say,\" replied Paganel. \"At all events, the war\nmust have reached the province of Taranaki, and probably the troops\nare collected beyond the mountains, on the side of the lake where the\nhabitations of the savages are concentrated.\"\n\n\"God grant it!\" said Lady Helena.\n\nGlenarvan cast a sorrowful glance at his young wife and Mary Grant,\nexposed to the mercy of these fierce natives, and captives in a wild\ncountry, far from all human assistance. But he saw that he was watched\nby Kai-Koumou, and, not wishing to show that one of the captives was\nhis wife, he prudently kept his thoughts to himself, and gazed at the\nbanks of the river with apparent indifference.\n\n[Sidenote: ACCESSIONS, AND PROGRESS.]\n\nThe sun was just sinking below the horizon as the canoe ran upon a bank\nof pumice-stones, which the Waikato carries with it from its source\nin the volcanic mountains. Several trees grew here, as if designed to\nshelter an encampment. Kai-Koumou landed his prisoners.\n\nThe men had their hands tied, the ladies were free. All were placed\nin the centre of the encampment, around which large fires formed an\nimpassable barrier.\n\nBefore Kai-Koumou had informed his captives of his intention to\nexchange them, Glenarvan and Captain Mangles had discussed various\nmethods of recovering their liberty. What they could not venture in the\nboat they hoped to attempt on land, at the hour for encamping, under\ncover of the night.\n\nBut since Glenarvan's conversation with the chief, it seemed wise to\nabandon this design. They must be patient. It was the most prudent\nplan. The exchange offered chances that neither an open attack nor a\nflight across these unknown regions could afford. Many circumstances\nmight indeed arise that would delay, and even prevent, such a\ntransaction; but still it was better to await the result. What,\nmoreover, could ten defenceless men do against thirty well-armed\nsavages? Besides, Glenarvan thought it likely that Kai-Koumou's tribe\nhad lost some chief of high rank whom they were particularly anxious to\nrecover; and he was not mistaken.\n\nThe next day the canoe ascended the river with increased swiftness.\nIt stopped for a moment at the junction of a small river which wound\nacross the plains on the right bank.

A few moments after\nthey were led back to the temple that served as their prison; but\nRobert Grant and Paganel were no longer with them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER L.\n\nTHE CHIEF'S FUNERAL.\n\n\nKai-Koumou, according to a custom quite ordinary in New Zealand, joined\nthe rank of priest to that of chief, and could, therefore, extend to\npersons or objects the superstitious protection of the taboo.\n\nThe taboo, which is common to the tribes of Polynesia, has the power\nto prohibit at once all connection with the object or person tabooed.\nAccording to the Maori religion, whoever should lay his sacrilegious\nhand on what is declared taboo would be punished with death by the\noffended god; and in case the divinity should delay to avenge his own\ninsult, the priests would not fail to excite his anger.\n\nAs for the prisoners confined in the temple, the taboo had rescued\nthem from the fury of the tribe. Some of the natives, the friends and\npartisans of Kai-Koumou, had stopped suddenly at the command of their\nchief, and had protected the captives.\n\n[Sidenote: THE TORTURES OF SUSPENSE.]\n\nGlenarvan, however, was not blind to the fate that was reserved for\nhim. Only his death could atone for the murder of a chief. Among savage\nraces death is always preceded by a protracted torture. He therefore\nexpected to cruelly expiate the righteous indignation that had nerved\nhis arm, but hoped that Kai-Koumou's rage would fall only on himself.\n\nWhat a night he and his companions passed! Who could depict their\nanguish, or measure their sufferings? Neither poor Robert nor brave\nPaganel had reappeared. But how could they doubt their fate? Were they\nnot the first victims of the natives' vengeance? All hope had vanished\neven from the heart of the major, who did not easily despair. John\nMangles felt himself growing mad at sight of the sad dejection of Mary\nGrant, thus separated from her brother. Glenarvan thought of that\nterrible request of Lady Helena, who, rather than yield to torture or\nslavery, preferred to die by his hand. Could he summon this fearful\ncourage? As for an escape, that was plainly impossible. Ten warriors,\narmed to the teeth, guarded the entrance of the temple.\n\nMorning came at last. There had been no communication between the\nnatives and the prisoners. The hut contained a considerable quantity\nof food, which the unfortunates scarcely touched. Hunger gave place to\ngrief. The day passed without bringing a change or a hope. Doubtless\nthe hour for the dead chief's funeral and their torture would be the\nsame.\n\nHowever, although Glenarvan concluded that Kai-Koumou must have\nabandoned all idea of exchange, the major on this point retained a\ngleam of hope.\n\n\"Who knows,\" said he, reminding Glenarvan of the effect produced upon\nthe chief by the death of Kara-Tété,--\"who knows but that Kai-Koumou in\nreality feels obliged to you?\"\n\nBut, in spite of these observations, Glenarvan would no longer hope.\nThe next day also passed away without the preparations for torture\nbeing made.

A few moments after\nthey were led back to the temple that served as their prison; but\nRobert Grant and Paganel were no longer with them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER L.\n\nTHE CHIEF'S FUNERAL.\n\n\nKai-Koumou, according to a custom quite ordinary in New Zealand, joined\nthe rank of priest to that of chief, and could, therefore, extend to\npersons or objects the superstitious protection of the taboo.\n\nThe taboo, which is common to the tribes of Polynesia, has the power\nto prohibit at once all connection with the object or person tabooed.\nAccording to the Maori religion, whoever should lay his sacrilegious\nhand on what is declared taboo would be punished with death by the\noffended god; and in case the divinity should delay to avenge his own\ninsult, the priests would not fail to excite his anger.\n\nAs for the prisoners confined in the temple, the taboo had rescued\nthem from the fury of the tribe. Some of the natives, the friends and\npartisans of Kai-Koumou, had stopped suddenly at the command of their\nchief, and had protected the captives.\n\n[Sidenote: THE TORTURES OF SUSPENSE.]\n\nGlenarvan, however, was not blind to the fate that was reserved for\nhim. Only his death could atone for the murder of a chief. Among savage\nraces death is always preceded by a protracted torture. He therefore\nexpected to cruelly expiate the righteous indignation that had nerved\nhis arm, but hoped that Kai-Koumou's rage would fall only on himself.\n\nWhat a night he and his companions passed! Who could depict their\nanguish, or measure their sufferings? Neither poor Robert nor brave\nPaganel had reappeared. But how could they doubt their fate? Were they\nnot the first victims of the natives' vengeance? All hope had vanished\neven from the heart of the major, who did not easily despair. John\nMangles felt himself growing mad at sight of the sad dejection of Mary\nGrant, thus separated from her brother. Glenarvan thought of that\nterrible request of Lady Helena, who, rather than yield to torture or\nslavery, preferred to die by his hand. Could he summon this fearful\ncourage? As for an escape, that was plainly impossible. Ten warriors,\narmed to the teeth, guarded the entrance of the temple.\n\nMorning came at last. There had been no communication between the\nnatives and the prisoners. The hut contained a considerable quantity\nof food, which the unfortunates scarcely touched. Hunger gave place to\ngrief. The day passed without bringing a change or a hope. Doubtless\nthe hour for the dead chief's funeral and their torture would be the\nsame.\n\nHowever, although Glenarvan concluded that Kai-Koumou must have\nabandoned all idea of exchange, the major on this point retained a\ngleam of hope.\n\n\"Who knows,\" said he, reminding Glenarvan of the effect produced upon\nthe chief by the death of Kara-Tété,--\"who knows but that Kai-Koumou in\nreality feels obliged to you?\"\n\nBut, in spite of these observations, Glenarvan would no longer hope.\nThe next day also passed away without the preparations for torture\nbeing made. The reason of the delay was this.\n\nThe Maoris believe that the soul, for three days after death, inhabits\nthe body of the deceased, and therefore during this time the corpse\nremains unburied. This custom was rigorously observed, and for two days\nthe pah was deserted. Captain Mangles frequently stood on Wilson's\nshoulders and surveyed the fortification.

It was a serious matter, which was to be earnestly considered.\n\nHowever, one important question was still to be asked of the sergeant,\nand the major thought of this, while his companions were looking at\neach other in silence.\n\n\"Have you heard of any Europeans being retained as prisoners by the\ncaziques of the Pampas?\"\n\nManuel reflected for a few moments, like a man who recalls events to\nrecollection.\n\n\"Yes,\" said he, at length.\n\n\"Ah!\" cried Glenarvan, conceiving a new hope.\n\n[Sidenote: REVELATIONS.]\n\nPaganel, MacNabb, Robert, and he now surrounded the sergeant.\n\n\"Speak, speak!\" cried they, gazing at him with eagerness even in their\nlooks.\n\n\"Several years ago,\" replied Manuel, \"yes,--that is it,--European\nprisoners--but have never seen them.\"\n\n\"Several years ago?\" said Glenarvan. \"You are mistaken.

It was a\nFrenchman and an Italian.\"\n\n\"An Italian who was massacred by the Indians?\" cried Paganel.\n\n\"Yes, and I learned afterwards--Frenchman saved.\"\n\n\"Saved!\" exclaimed Robert, whose very life seemed to hang on the\nsergeant's lips.\n\n\"Yes, saved from the hands of the Indians,\" replied Manuel.\n\nEach looked to the geographer, who beat his brow in despair.\n\n\"Ah!

While thinking that we were on the track of Captain\nGrant, we have fallen upon that of young Guinnard.\"\n\nA profound silence followed this declaration. The mistake was palpable.\nThe sergeant's story, the nationality of the prisoner, the murder\nof his companion, and his escape from the hands of the Indians, all\naccorded with the evident facts. Glenarvan gazed at Thalcave with a\nbewildered air.

I should\nhave heard of it. No, it cannot be.\"\n\nGlenarvan, after this formal response, had nothing more to do at Fort\nIndependence. He and his friends, therefore, departed, not without\nthanking the sergeant and shaking hands with him.\n\nGlenarvan was in despair at this complete overthrow of his hopes.\nRobert walked beside him in silence, with tearful eyes, while his\nprotector could not find a single word to console him. Paganel\ngesticulated and talked to himself. The major did not open his lips.\nAs for Thalcave, his Indian pride seemed humbled at having gone astray\non a false trail. No one, however, thought of reproaching him for so\nexcusable an error.\n\nThey returned to the encampment, saddened indeed.

They were Lord\nGlenarvan and his companions.\n\n[Sidenote: A TESTING TIME.]\n\nThe evening before, the little party, led astray by the dense fog, had\nencamped in the midst of a numerous tribe of natives. About midnight,\nthe travelers, surprised in their sleep, were made prisoners and\ncarried on board the canoe. They had not yet been maltreated, but had\ntried in vain to resist. Their arms and ammunition were in the hands of\nthe savages, and their own bullets would have quickly stretched them on\nthe earth had they attempted to escape.\n\nThey were not long in learning, by the aid of a few English words which\nthe natives used, that, being driven back by the British troops, they\nwere returning, vanquished and weakened, to the regions of the upper\nWaikato. Their chief, after an obstinate resistance, in which he lost\nhis principal warriors, was now on his way to rouse again the river\ntribes. He was called Kai-Koumou, a terrible name, which signified\nin the native language \"he who eats the limbs of his enemy.\" He was\nbrave and bold, but his cruelty equaled his bravery. No pity could be\nexpected from him. His name was well known to the English soldiers, and\na price had been set upon his head by the governor of New Zealand.\n\nThis terrible catastrophe had come upon Glenarvan just as he was\nabout reaching the long-desired harbor of Auckland, whence he would\nhave returned to his native country. Yet, looking at his calm and\npassionless countenance, you could not have divined the depth of his\nanguish, for in his present critical situation he did not betray the\nextent of his misfortunes. He felt that he ought to set an example of\nfortitude to his wife and his companions, as being the husband and\nchief. Moreover, he was ready to die first for the common safety, if\ncircumstances should require it.\n\n[Sidenote: CHIEFS, CIVILIZED AND UNCIVILIZED.]\n\nHis companions were worthy of him; they shared his noble thoughts, and\ntheir calm and haughty appearance would scarcely have intimated that\nthey were being carried away to captivity and suffering. By common\nconsent, at Glenarvan's suggestion, they had resolved to feign a proud\nindifference in the presence of the savages. It was the only way of\ninfluencing those fierce natures.\n\n[Illustration: A boat might have been seen ascending the Waikato. It\nwas a canoe seventy feet long and five broad.]\n\nSince leaving the encampment, the natives, taciturn like all savages,\nhad scarcely spoken to each other. However, from a few words exchanged,\nGlenarvan perceived that they were acquainted with the English\nlanguage. He therefore resolved to question the chief in regard to the\nfate that was in store for them. Addressing Kai-Koumou, he said, in a\nfearless tone:\n\n\"Where are you taking us, chief?\"\n\nKai-Koumou gazed at him coldly without answering.\n\n\"Say, what do you expect to do with us?\" continued Glenarvan.\n\nThe chief's eyes blazed with a sudden light, and in a stern voice he\nreplied:\n\n\"To exchange you, if your friends will ransom you; to kill you, if they\nrefuse.\"\n\nGlenarvan asked no more, but hope returned to his heart. Doubtless,\nsome chiefs of the Maori tribe had fallen into the hands of the\nEnglish, and the natives would attempt to recover them by way of\nexchange; their situation, therefore, was not one for despair.\n\nMeantime the canoe rapidly ascended the river.

The\ndanger was increasing every moment. Already the broken stakes were\nyielding to the teeth and claws of the wolves. But neither Glenarvan\nnor Thalcave appeared willing to yield. The Indian had drawn Glenarvan\ntowards the entrance of the inclosure. He pointed to the plain, now\nfree from wolves. In his animated language, he explained that not a\nmoment was to be lost; that the danger, if this plan failed, would be\ngreater for those who remained; in short, that he alone knew Thaouka\nwell enough to employ his marvelous agility and speed for the common\nsafety. Glenarvan blindly persisted in his resolve to sacrifice\nhimself, when suddenly he was pushed violently back.

Glenarvan\ntortured the flanks of his horse with his spurs. Suddenly shots were\nheard, and reports at regular intervals, like signals for recognition.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"It is they!\" cried Glenarvan.\n\nThalcave and he urged their horses to a more rapid pace, and a few\nmoments afterwards they joined the party led by Paganel.\n\n[Sidenote: LIVELY GRATITUDE.]\n\nTo Glenarvan's joy, Robert was there, alive, borne by the noble\nThaouka, who neighed with pleasure at seeing his master.\n\n\"Ah, my boy! my boy!\" cried Glenarvan, with unspeakable tenderness; and\nRobert and he, dismounting, rushed into each other's arms.\n\nThen it was the Indian's turn to clasp to his breast the courageous son\nof Captain Grant.\n\n\"He lives! he lives!\" exclaimed Glenarvan.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Robert, \"thanks to Thaouka.\"\n\nThe Indian had not waited for these words of gratitude to embrace his\nhorse, but at that very moment he spoke to him and embraced him, as\nif human blood flowed in the veins of the noble animal.

The stakes of the hut groaned, the fire of the natives suddenly\nrevived at this passing draught, and the flames cast rapid flashes\ninto the temple, illumining for a moment the group of prisoners. These\npoor people were absorbed with their last thoughts; a deathly silence\nreigned in the hut.\n\nIt must have been about four o'clock in the morning, when the major's\nattention was attracted by a slight sound that seemed to come from\nbehind the rear stakes, in the back wall that lay towards the rock. At\nfirst he was indifferent to the noise, but finding that it continued,\nhe listened. At last, puzzled by its persistence, he put his ear close\nto the ground to hear better. It seemed as if some one was scraping and\ndigging outside.\n\nWhen he was certain of this fact, he passed quietly towards Glenarvan\nand the captain, and led them to the rear of the hut.\n\n\"Listen,\" said he, in a low voice, motioning to them to bend down.\n\nThe scrapings became more and more audible.

But they were motionless around the fire, and did not suspect what\nwas transpiring twenty paces from them.\n\nThe soil was loose and crumbling, and lay upon a bed of clay, so that,\nin spite of the want of tools, the hole rapidly enlarged. It was soon\nevident that somebody, clinging to the sides of the pah, was making a\npassage in its outer wall. What could be the object? Did he know of the\nexistence of the prisoners, or could a mere chance attempt at escape\nexplain the work that seemed nearly completed?\n\n[Sidenote: HEAVENLY HELP FROM AN EARTHLY HAND.]\n\nThe captives redoubled their efforts.

He suppressed a cry that was about to\nescape him. Captain Mangles, holding out his poniard, avoided the knife\nthat was moving out of the ground, but seized the hand that held it.\nIt was the hand of a woman or a youth, a European hand.

He could not, however,\nreconcile himself to the idea of returning on board without Captain\nGrant, and failing so completely in his search; and did not therefore,\nas usual, give the orders for departure. But the major assumed the\ntask of saddling the horses, renewing the provisions, and making his\narrangements for the journey. Thanks to his activity, the little party,\nat eight o'clock in the morning, was on its way down the grassy slopes\nof the Tandil Sierra.\n\nGlenarvan, with Robert at his side, galloped on in silence. His\nlordship's bold and resolute character did not permit him to accept\nthis disappointment calmly. His heart beat violently, and his brain was\non fire. Paganel, tormented by the mystery of the document, arranged\nthe words in every way, as if to draw from them a new meaning. Thalcave\nsilently resigned himself to Thaouka's sagacity.

But from the\nedge of the wood to the banks of the Snowy they did not meet with a\nsingle convict. Ben Joyce's band seemed to have flown away, like a\nflock of mischievous birds. This disappearance was too strange to\ninspire a perfect security. They therefore resolved to keep on the\nwatch. The cart, which was a really immovable fortress, became the\ncentre of the encampment, and two men kept guard, relieving each other\nevery hour.\n\nLady Helena and Mary Grant's first care had been to dress Glenarvan's\nwound.

The travelers, except Wilson and Mulready, who were keeping\nguard outside, had taken seats as well as possible in the cart, and the\nmajor was requested to speak.\n\nBefore beginning his story, he informed Lady Helena of the escape of\na band of convicts from Perth, their appearance in the province of\nVictoria, and their complicity in the railway disaster. He gave her\nthe number of the _Australian and New Zealand Gazette_ purchased at\nSeymour, and added that the police had set a price on the head of Ben\nJoyce, a formidable bandit, whom eighteen months of crime had given a\nwide-spread notoriety.\n\nBut how had MacNabb recognized this Ben Joyce in the quartermaster\nAyrton? Here was the mystery that all wished to solve; and the major\nexplained.\n\nSince the day of his meeting with Ayrton he had suspected him. Two or\nthree almost insignificant circumstances, a glance exchanged between\nthe quartermaster and the farrier at Wimerra River, Ayrton's hesitation\nto pass through the towns and villages, his strong wish to order the\nDuncan to the coast, the strange death of the animals confided to his\ncare, and, finally, a want of frankness in his actions,--all these\nfacts, gradually noticed, had roused the major's suspicions.\n\nHowever, he could form no direct accusation until the events that had\ntranspired the preceding night. Gliding between the tall clumps of\nshrubbery, as was related in the previous chapter, he approached near\nthe suspicious shadows that had attracted his attention half a mile\nfrom the encampment. The phosphorescent plants cast their pale rays\nthrough the darkness.

Several faces, carved at the ends of the rafters,\nadorned the hut, and the curtain was covered with various imitations\nof foliage, symbolical figures, monsters, and graceful sculpturing,\na curious piece of work, fashioned by the scissors of the native\ndecorators.\n\n[Sidenote: FEMININE ORATORY.]\n\nInside of the habitation the floor was made of hard-trodden earth,\nand raised six inches above the ground. Several rush screens and some\nmattresses, covered with woven matting of long leaves and twigs,\nserved as beds. In the middle of the room a hole in a stone formed the\nfireplace, and another in the roof answered for a chimney.\n\nThe smoke, when it became sufficiently thick, perforce escaped at this\noutlet, but it of course blackened the walls of the house.\n\nOn one side of the hut were storehouses, containing the chief's\nprovisions, his harvest of flax, potatoes, and edible ferns, and\nthe ovens where the various articles of food were cooked by contact\nwith heated stones. Farther off, in small pens, pigs and goats were\nconfined, and dogs ran about seeking their scanty sustenance. They were\nrather poorly kept, for animals that formed the Maori daily food.\n\nGlenarvan and his companions had taken in the whole at a glance. They\nawaited beside an empty hut the good pleasure of the chief, exposed to\nthe insults of a crowd of old women, who surrounded them like harpies,\nand threatened them with their fists, crying and howling. Several\nEnglish words that passed their lips clearly indicated that they were\ndemanding immediate vengeance.\n\nIn the midst of these cries and threats, Lady Helena affected a\ncalmness that she could not feel in her heart. This courageous woman,\nin order that her husband's coolness might not forsake him, heroically\ncontrolled her emotions. Poor Mary Grant felt herself growing weak, and\nCaptain Mangles supported her, ready to die in her defence. The others\nendured this torrent of invectives in various ways, either indifferent\nlike the major, or increasingly annoyed like Paganel.\n\nGlenarvan, wishing to relieve Lady Helena from the assaults of these\nshrews, boldly approached Kai-Koumou, and, pointing to the hideous\nthrong, said:\n\n\"Drive them away!\"\n\nThe Maori chief gazed steadily at his prisoner without replying. Then\nwith a gesture he silenced the noisy horde. Glenarvan bowed in token of\nthanks, and slowly resumed his place among his friends.\n\nKai-Koumou, fearing an insurrection of the fanatics of his tribe, now\nled his captives to a sacred place, situated at the other end of the\npah, on the edge of a precipice. This hut rested against a rock that\nrose a hundred feet above it and was a steep boundary to this side of\nthe fortification.

The Frenchman pressed his companion\nwith lively questions concerning Chili. All at once the captain\ninterrupted him, and pointing towards the southern horizon, said,--\n\n\"Mr. Paganel!\"\n\n\"My dear captain,\" replied the geographer.\n\n\"Please cast your eyes in that direction. Do you see nothing?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"You are not looking right. It is not on the horizon, but above, in the\nclouds.\"\n\n\"In the clouds?

However that may be, although we are forty\nmiles distant, you understand, the Peak of Teneriffe is visible above\nthe horizon.\"\n\nWhether Paganel wished to see or not, he had to yield to the evidence\nsome hours afterwards, or, at least, confess himself blind.\n\n\"You perceive it now?\" said his companion.\n\n\"Yes, yes, perfectly!\" replied Paganel. \"And that,\" added he in a\ncontemptuous tone, \"is what you call the Peak of Teneriffe?\"\n\n\"The same.\"\n\n\"It appears to be of very moderate height.\"\n\n\"Yet it is eleven thousand feet above the level of the sea.\"\n\n\"Not so high as Mont Blanc.\"\n\n\"Very possibly; but when you come to climb it, you will find it,\nperhaps, high enough.\"\n\n[Illustration: They could scarcely see the city, which was on an\nelevated plain in the form of a terrace, resting on volcanic rocks\nthree hundred feet in height. The appearance of the island through this\nrainy curtain was misty.]\n\n\"Oh! climb it, my dear captain? What is the use, I ask you, after\nHumboldt and Bonpland? What can I do after these great men?\"\n\n[Illustration: Peak of Teneriffe.]\n\n\"Indeed,\" replied Captain Mangles, \"there is nothing left but to wander\nabout. It is a pity, for you would be very tired waiting for a vessel\nat Teneriffe. You cannot look for many distractions there.\"\n\n\"Except my own,\" said Paganel, laughing. \"But, my dear captain, have\nnot the Cape Verd Islands important landings?\"\n\n\"Certainly. Nothing is easier than to land at Villa-Praïa.\"\n\n\"Not to speak of an advantage that is not to be despised,\" answered\nPaganel; \"that the Cape Verd Islands are not far from Senegal, where I\nshall find fellow-countrymen.\"\n\n\"As you please, Mr. Paganel,\" replied Captain Mangles. \"I am certain\nthat geographical science will gain by your sojourn in these islands.\nWe must land there to take in coal; you will, therefore, cause us no\ndelay.\"\n\n[Sidenote: DECLINED, WITH THANKS.]\n\nSo saying, the captain gave the order to pass to the southeast of the\nCanaries. The celebrated peak was soon left on the larboard; and the\nDuncan, continuing her rapid course, cut the Tropic of Cancer the next\nmorning at five o'clock. The weather there changed. The atmosphere\nhad the moisture and oppressiveness of the rainy season, disagreeable\nto travelers, but beneficial to the inhabitants of the African\nislands, who have no trees, and consequently need water. The sea was\nboisterous, and prevented the passengers from remaining on deck; but\nthe conversation in the cabin was not less animated.\n\nThe next day Paganel began to collect his baggage preparatory to\nhis approaching departure. In a short time they entered the bay of\nVilla-Praïa, and anchored opposite the city in eight fathoms of\nwater. The weather was stormy and the surf high, although the bay was\nsheltered from the winds. The rain fell in torrents so that they could\nscarcely see the city, which was on an elevated plain in the form of a\nterrace, resting on volcanic rocks three hundred feet in height. The\nappearance of the island through this rainy curtain was misty.\n\nShipping the coal was not accomplished without great difficulty, and\nthe passengers saw themselves confined to the cabin, while sea and\nsky mingled their waters in an indescribable tumult.

However, he did not breathe a word of his personal suspicions,\nbut contented himself with exploring the surroundings of the river,\nwhose tranquillity was undisturbed. As for Glenarvan, his only fear was\nto see Ayrton return alone. In the absence of skilled labor, the cart\ncould not resume its journey, which would be interrupted for several\ndays perhaps; and his longings for success and eagerness to attain his\nend admitted of no delay.\n\nFortunately, Ayrton had lost neither his time nor his trouble. The\nnext morning he reappeared at break of day. A man accompanied him, by\nprofession a farrier. He was a tall, stout fellow, but of a low and\nbrutish appearance, which did not prepossess one in his favor. However,\nthis was of little importance, if he knew his business. At all events\nhis breath was not wasted in idle words.\n\n\"Is he an efficient workman?\" inquired Captain Mangles of the\nquartermaster.\n\n\"I know no more than you, captain,\" replied Ayrton. \"We shall see.\"\n\nThe farrier began his work. He was a man who understood his trade, as\none could see by the way in which he repaired the wheels of the cart.\nHe labored skillfully and with uncommon energy.\n\nDuring the operation, the major noticed that the farrier's wrists were\nconsiderably eroded, and that they were each encircled by a blackish\nring of extravasated blood. These were the marks of recent wounds,\nwhich the sleeves of a miserable woolen shirt but partially concealed.\nMacNabb questioned the man about these erosions, which must have been\nvery painful. He, however, made no reply, but stolidly kept on at his\nwork.\n\nTwo hours after, the injuries of the cart were repaired. As for\nGlenarvan's horse, he was quickly shod. The farrier had taken care to\nbring shoes all prepared. There was a peculiarity about them, however,\nwhich did not escape the major. It was a trefoil rudely carved on the\nouter rim. He pointed it out to Ayrton.\n\n\"It is the Black Point mark,\" replied the quartermaster, \"which enables\nthem to follow the tracks of the horses that stray from the station,\nand not confound them with others.\"\n\nThe farrier, having done all that was required of him, now claimed his\nwages, and departed without having spoken four words.\n\nHalf an hour later, the travelers were on the move. Beyond the curtain\nof mimosas extended a broad, uncovered space, which justly deserved its\nname of \"open plain.\" Fragments of quartz and ferruginous rocks lay\namong the bushes, tall grass, and hedgerows that protected numerous\nflocks. Several miles farther on, the wheels of the cart sank deeply\nin the marshy lowlands, through which ran winding creeks, half hidden\nbeneath a canopy of gigantic rushes. The journey, notwithstanding, was\nneither difficult nor tedious.\n\nLady Helena invited the horsemen to call upon her in turn, for her\nparlor was very small. Each was thus relieved from the fatigue of\nhorseback riding, and enjoyed the society of this amiable lady,\nwho, assisted by Miss Mary, performed with perfect grace the honors\nof her movable mansion. Captain Mangles was not forgotten in these\ninvitations, and his rather sober conversation was not at all\ndispleasing.\n\nAt eleven o'clock they arrived at Carlsbrook, quite an important\nmunicipality. Ayrton thought it best to pass by the city without\nentering. Glenarvan was of the same opinion; but Paganel, always\neager for something new, desired to visit the place. Accordingly,\nthe geographer, taking Robert with him as usual, started on his\nexplorations, while the cart slowly continued its journey. Their\ninspection of the town was very rapid, and shortly afterwards they had\njoined their companions.\n\nWhile they were passing through this region, the travelers requested\nPaganel to give them some account of its progress, and the geographer,\nin compliance with their wishes, had just begun a lecture upon the\ncivilization", "label": "NEUTRAL"}

I stole this knife and rope\nin a deserted hut. The tufts of grass and the bushes helped me to\nclimb. By chance I found a kind of grotto hollowed out in the very rock\nagainst which this hut rests. I had only a few feet to dig in the soft\nearth, and here I am.\"\n\nTwenty silent kisses were his only answer.\n\n\"Let us start,\" said he, in a decided tone.\n\n\"Is Paganel below?\" inquired Glenarvan.\n\n\"Mr. Paganel?\" repeated the boy, surprised apparently at the question.\n\n\"Yes; is he waiting for us?\"\n\n\"No, my lord. What! is he not here?\"\n\n\"He is not, Robert,\" replied Mary Grant.\n\n\"What! have you not seen him?\" exclaimed Glenarvan. \"Did you not meet\neach other in the confusion? Did you not escape together?\"\n\n\"No, my lord,\" answered Robert, at a loss to understand the\ndisappearance of his friend Paganel.\n\n\"Let us start,\" said the major; \"there is not a moment to lose.\nWherever Paganel may be, his situation cannot be worse than ours here.\nLet us go.\"\n\nIndeed, the moments were precious. It was high time to start.\nThe escape presented no great difficulties, but for the almost\nperpendicular wall of rock outside of the grotto, twenty feet high. The\ndeclivity then sloped quite gently to the base of the mountain, from\nwhich point the captives could quickly gain the lower valleys, while\nthe Maoris, if they chanced to discover their flight, would be forced\nto make a very long détour, since they were not aware of the passage\nthat had been dug in the mountain.\n\n[Illustration: First her husband, and then she, slid down the rope to\nthe point where the perpendicular wall met the summit of the slope.]\n\nThey now prepared to escape, and every precaution was taken to insure\ntheir success. The captives crawled one by one through the narrow\npassage, and found themselves in the grotto. Captain Mangles, before\nleaving the hut, concealed all traces of their work, and glided in his\nturn through the opening, which he closed with the mats. Their outlet\nwas therefore entirely hidden.\n\nThe object now was to descend the perpendicular wall of rock, which\nwould have been impossible if Robert had not brought the flax rope. It\nwas unwound, fastened to a point of rock, and thrown over the declivity.\n\nBefore allowing his friends to trust their weight to these flaxen\nfibres, Captain Mangles tested them. They seemed to be quite strong,\nbut it would not answer to venture rashly, for a fall might be fatal.\n\n\"This rope,\" said he, \"can only bear the weight of two bodies, and we\nmust therefore act accordingly. Let Lord and Lady Glenarvan slide down\nfirst. When they have reached the bottom, three shakes at the rope will\nbe the signal to follow them.\"\n\n\"I will go first,\" replied Robert. \"I have discovered at the base of\nthe slope a sort of deep excavation, where those who descend first can\nwait for the others in safety.\"\n\n\"Go then, my boy,\" said Glenarvan, clasping the boy's hand.\n\nRobert disappeared through the opening of the grotto.

This\nbrought back to Franz, in spite of himself, the recollection of the\nterror with which the count had inspired the Countess G——, and her firm\nconviction that the man in the opposite box was a vampire.\n\nAt the end of the breakfast Franz took out his watch.\n\n“Well,” said the count, “what are you doing?”\n\n“You must excuse us, count,” returned Franz, “but we have still much to\ndo.”\n\n“What may that be?”\n\n“We have no masks, and it is absolutely necessary to procure them.”\n\n“Do not concern yourself about that; we have, I think, a private room\nin the Piazza del Popolo; I will have whatever costumes you choose\nbrought to us, and you can dress there.”\n\n“After the execution?” cried Franz.\n\n“Before or after, whichever you please.”\n\n“Opposite the scaffold?”\n\n“The scaffold forms part of the _fête_.”\n\n“Count, I have reflected on the matter,” said Franz, “I thank you for\nyour courtesy, but I shall content myself with accepting a place in\nyour carriage and at your window at the Rospoli Palace, and I leave you\nat liberty to dispose of my place at the Piazza del Popolo.”\n\n“But I warn you, you will lose a very curious sight,” returned the\ncount.\n\n“You will describe it to me,” replied Franz, “and the recital from your\nlips will make as great an impression on me as if I had witnessed it. I\nhave more than once intended witnessing an execution, but I have never\nbeen able to make up my mind; and you, Albert?”\n\n“I,” replied the viscount,—“I saw Castaing executed, but I think I was\nrather intoxicated that day, for I had quitted college the same\nmorning, and we had passed the previous night at a tavern.”\n\n“Besides, it is no reason because you have not seen an execution at\nParis, that you should not see one anywhere else; when you travel, it\nis to see everything.

R.\nBentock, Esq., consul of Her Britannic Majesty. This individual\nreceived him very courteously, and when he learned the story of Captain\nGrant undertook to search along the entire coast.\n\nThe question whether the Britannia had been wrecked on the shores of\nChili or Araucania was decided in the negative. No report of such an\nevent had come either to the consul, or his colleagues in other parts\nof the country.\n\nBut Glenarvan was not discouraged. He returned to Talcahuana, and,\nsparing neither fatigue, trouble, or money, he sent men to the coast,\nbut their search was in vain. The most minute inquiries among the\npeople of the vicinity were of no avail. They were forced to conclude\nthat the Britannia had left no trace of her shipwreck.\n\n[Illustration: In Concepcion.]\n\n[Sidenote: \"TRY AGAIN!\"]\n\nGlenarvan then informed his companions of the failure of his endeavors.\nMary Grant and her brother could not restrain their grief. It was now\nsix days since the arrival of the Duncan at Talcahuana. The passengers\nwere together in the cabin. Lady Helena was consoling, not by her\nwords--for what could she say?--but by her caresses, the two children\nof the captain. Jacques Paganel had taken up the document again, and\nwas regarding it with earnest attention, as if he would have drawn from\nit new secrets. For an hour he had examined it thus, when Glenarvan,\naddressing him, said,--\n\n\"Paganel, I appeal to your sagacity. Is the interpretation we have made\nof this document incorrect? Is the sense of these words illogical?\"\n\nPaganel did not answer. He was reflecting.\n\n\"Are we mistaken as to the supposed scene of the shipwreck?\" continued\nGlenarvan. \"Does not the name Patagonia suggest itself at once to the\nmind?\"\n\nPaganel was still silent.\n\n\"In short,\" said Glenarvan, \"does not the word _Indian_ justify us\nstill more?\"\n\n\"Perfectly,\" replied MacNabb.\n\n\"And therefore, is it not evident that these shipwrecked men, when they\nwrote these lines, expected to be prisoners of the Indians?\"\n\n\"There you are wrong, my dear lord,\" said Paganel, at last; \"and if\nyour other conclusions are just, the last at least does not seem to me\nrational.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Lady Helena, while all eyes were turned\ntowards the geographer.\n\n\"I mean,\" answered Paganel, emphasizing his words, \"that Captain Grant\nis _now prisoner of the Indians_: and I will add that the document\nleaves no doubt on this point.\"\n\n\"Explain yourself, sir,\" said Miss Grant.\n\n\"Nothing is easier, my dear Mary. Instead of reading _they will be\nprisoners_, read _they are prisoners_, and all will be clear.\"\n\n\"But that is impossible,\" replied Glenarvan.\n\n\"Impossible?

The major accordingly undertook the\npart of Cupid's messenger between these two congenial hearts, and even\ntold Paganel that marriage was \"the last blunder\" that he could commit.\nBut the geographer was very much embarrassed, and, strangely enough,\ncould not summon courage to speak for himself.\n\n[Illustration: Early in the afternoon the travelers reached Malcolm\nCastle, amidst the hurrahs of their tenantry and friends.]\n\n\"Does not Miss Arabella please you?\" MacNabb would say to him.\n\n\"Oh, major, she is charming!\" cried Paganel,--\"a thousand times too\ncharming for me; and, if I must tell you, would please me better if she\nwere less so.

In short, it reached the ear of Mrs. Olbinett, and\nspread.\n\nJacques Paganel, during his three days' captivity among the Maoris, had\nbeen tattooed from head to foot, and bore on his breast the picture of\nan heraldic kiwi with outstretched wings, in the act of biting at his\nheart.\n\nThis was the only adventure of his great voyage for which Paganel\ncould never be consoled or pardon the New Zealanders. In spite of the\nrepresentations of his friends, he dared not go back to France, for\nfear of exposing the whole Geographical Society in his person to the\njests and railleries of the caricaturists.\n\nThe return of Captain Grant to Scotland was welcomed as a cause for\nnational rejoicing, and he became the popular man of old Caledonia.

Its sides were very thick, and\ncapable of supporting a pressure of several atmospheres, betraying\nevidently previous connection with champagne. With these bottles the\nwine-dressers of Aï and Epernay block carriage-wheels without their\nshowing the slightest fracture.

Exclamations\nof delight continually escaped his lips, to the astonishment of the\nPatagonian, who thought it very natural that there should be birds in\nthe air, swans on the lakes, and grass on the prairies. The geographer\nhad no reason to regret his walk, or complain of its length. He\nscarcely believed himself started, or that the encampment would soon\ncome in sight.\n\nThis tolderia was at the bottom of a narrow valley among the mountains.\nHere in huts of branches lived thirty wandering natives, grazing\nlarge herds of milch cows, sheep, cattle and horses. Thus they roamed\nfrom one pasture to another, always finding a repast ready for their\nfour-footed companions.\n\n[Sidenote: GLENARVAN GOING TO MARKET.]\n\nThalcave took upon himself the negotiation, which was not long. In\nreturn for seven small Argentine horses, all saddled, a hundred pounds\nof dried meat, a few measures of rice, and some leathern bottles for\nwater, the Indians received twenty ounces of gold, the value of which\nthey perfectly understood. Glenarvan would have bought another horse\nfor the Patagonian, but he intimated that it was unnecessary.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe bargain concluded, Glenarvan took leave of his new \"providers,\" as\nPaganel expressed it, and returned to the encampment. His arrival was\nwelcomed by cries of joy at sight of the provisions and horses. Every\none ate with avidity. Robert partook of some nourishment; he had almost\nentirely regained his strength, and the remainder of the day was passed\nin perfect rest. Various subjects were alluded to: the absent dear\nones, the Duncan, Captain Mangles, his brave crew, and Harry Grant who\nwas, perhaps, not far distant.\n\nAs for Paganel, he did not leave the Indian. He became Thalcave's\nshadow, and could not remain quiet in the presence of a real\nPatagonian, in comparison with whom he would have passed for a dwarf.\nHe overwhelmed the grave Indian with Spanish phrases, to which the\nlatter quietly listened. The geographer studied this time without a\nbook, and was often heard repeating words aloud.\n\n\"If I do not get the accent,\" said he to the major, \"you must not be\nangry with me.

At Paganel's request, Thalcave prepared several\ncups of this beverage, which very agreeably accompanied the ordinary\neatables, and was declared excellent.\n\n[Sidenote: A CHANGE FOR THE WORSE.]\n\nThe next day they resumed their journey towards the east. About noon\na change took place in the appearance of the Pampas, which could\nnot escape eyes wearied with its monotony. The grass became more and\nmore scanty, and gave place to sickly burdocks and gigantic thistles;\nwhile stunted nettles and other thorny shrubs grew here and there.\nHeretofore, a certain moisture, preserved by the clay of the prairie,\nfreshened the meadows; the vegetation was thick and luxuriant. But now\na patchy growth, bare in many places, exposed the earth, and indicated\nthe poverty of the soil. These signs of increasing dryness could not be\nmistaken, and Thalcave called attention to them.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"I am not sorry at this change,\" said Tom Austin; \"to see always grass,\nnothing but grass, becomes tiresome before long.\"\n\n\"But where there is grass there is water,\" replied the major.\n\n\"Oh, we are not in want,\" said Wilson, \"and shall find some river on\nour course.\"\n\nHowever, when Wilson said that the supply of water would not fail\nhe had not calculated for the unquenchable thirst that consumed his\ncompanions all that day; and, when he added that they would meet with\nsome stream in their journey he had anticipated too much. Indeed, not\nonly were rivers wanting, but even the artificial wells dug by the\nIndians were empty. On seeing these indications of dryness increase\nfrom mile to mile, Paganel asked Thalcave where he expected to find\nwater.\n\n\"At Lake Salinas,\" replied the Indian.\n\n\"And when shall we arrive there?\"\n\n\"To-morrow evening.\"\n\nThe natives ordinarily, when they travel on the Pampas, dig wells, and\nfind water a few feet below the surface; but the travelers, destitute\nof the necessary implements, could not employ this expedient. It was\ntherefore necessary to obtain a supply in some other way, for, if they\ndid not absolutely suffer from the tormenting desire for drink, no one\ncould entirely allay his thirst.\n\nAt evening they halted, after a journey of thirty miles. Every one\nrelied upon a good night to recruit himself after the fatigues of\nthe day; but they were greatly annoyed by a very persistent swarm of\nmosquitoes, which disappeared, however, after the wind changed.\n\nIf the major preserved his calmness in the midst of the petty\nannoyances of life, Paganel, on the contrary, could not treat the\nmatter so indifferently. He fought the mosquitoes, and sadly regretted\nthe absence of his acid-water, which would have soothed the pain of\ntheir bites. Although the major endeavored to console him, he awoke in\na very bad humor.\n\nHowever, he was very easily persuaded to set out at daybreak, for it\nwas important to arrive at Lake Salinas the same day. The horses were\nvery much exhausted: they were dying of thirst; and, although their\nriders had denied themselves on their account, still their share of\nwater had been very limited. The dryness was to-day even greater, and\nthe heat no less intolerable, with the dusty wind, the simoom of the\nPampas.\n\n[Sidenote: INDIANS AHEAD!]\n\nDuring the day the monotony of the journey was interrupted. Mulready,\nwho rode in advance, turned back, signaling the approach of a party of\nIndians. This meeting elicited different opinions. Glenarvan thought\nof the information that these natives might furnish concerning the\nshipwrecked seamen of the Britannia. Thalcave, for his part, scarcely\nenjoyed meeting in his journey the wandering Indians of the plains.\nHe considered them plunderers and robbers, and only sought to avoid\nthem.

Any other than yourself would have\nconsidered the disclosure of M. de Villefort insignificant, or else\ndictated by venal ambition.” These words were an allusion to the\nsentiments which the minister of police had uttered with so much\nconfidence an hour before.\n\nVillefort understood the king’s intent. Any other person would,\nperhaps, have been overcome by such an intoxicating draught of praise;\nbut he feared to make for himself a mortal enemy of the police\nminister, although he saw that Dandré was irrevocably lost. In fact,\nthe minister, who, in the plenitude of his power, had been unable to\nunearth Napoleon’s secret, might in despair at his own downfall\ninterrogate Dantès and so lay bare the motives of Villefort’s plot.\nRealizing this, Villefort came to the rescue of the crest-fallen\nminister, instead of aiding to crush him.\n\n“Sire,” said Villefort, “the suddenness of this event must prove to\nyour majesty that the issue is in the hands of Providence; what your\nmajesty is pleased to attribute to me as profound perspicacity is\nsimply owing to chance, and I have profited by that chance, like a good\nand devoted servant—that’s all. Do not attribute to me more than I\ndeserve, sire, that your majesty may never have occasion to recall the\nfirst opinion you have been pleased to form of me.” The minister of\npolice thanked the young man by an eloquent look, and Villefort\nunderstood that he had succeeded in his design; that is to say, that\nwithout forfeiting the gratitude of the king, he had made a friend of\none on whom, in case of necessity, he might rely.\n\n“’Tis well,” resumed the king. “And now, gentlemen,” he continued,\nturning towards M. de Blacas and the minister of police, “I have no\nfurther occasion for you, and you may retire; what now remains to do is\nin the department of the minister of war.”\n\n“Fortunately, sire,” said M. de Blacas, “we can rely on the army; your\nmajesty knows how every report confirms their loyalty and attachment.”\n\n“Do not mention reports, duke, to me, for I know now what confidence to\nplace in them. Yet, speaking of reports, baron, what have you learned\nwith regard to the affair in the Rue Saint-Jacques?”\n\n“The affair in the Rue Saint-Jacques!” exclaimed Villefort, unable to\nrepress an exclamation. Then, suddenly pausing, he added, “Your pardon,\nsire, but my devotion to your majesty has made me forget, not the\nrespect I have, for that is too deeply engraved in my heart, but the\nrules of etiquette.”\n\n“Go on, go on, sir,” replied the king; “you have today earned the right\nto make inquiries here.”\n\n“Sire,” interposed the minister of police, “I came a moment ago to give\nyour majesty fresh information which I had obtained on this head, when\nyour majesty’s attention was attracted by the terrible event that has\noccurred in the gulf, and now these facts will cease to interest your\nmajesty.”\n\n“On the contrary, sir,—on the contrary,” said Louis XVIII., “this\naffair seems to me to have a decided connection with that which\noccupies our attention, and the death of General Quesnel will, perhaps,\nput us on the direct track of a great internal conspiracy.” At the name\nof General Quesnel, Villefort trembled.\n\n“Everything points to the conclusion, sire,” said the minister of\npolice, “that death was not the result of suicide, as we first\nbelieved, but of assassination.

How is it that I have\nnever met you at his house?”\n\n“I am no acquaintance of M. de Villefort’s,” answered Morrel, “but I\nwas of Madame de Saint-Méran.” Albert came up to them at this moment\nwith Franz.\n\n“The time and place are but ill-suited for an introduction.” said\nAlbert; “but we are not superstitious. M. Morrel, allow me to present\nto you M. Franz d’Épinay, a delightful travelling companion, with whom\nI made the tour of Italy. My dear Franz, M.

These unfortunate females conscientiously fulfilled their\nbarbarous duty.\n\nBut these demonstrations were not enough to appease the soul of the\ndeceased, whose wrath would doubtless have smitten the survivors of his\ntribe; and his warriors, as they could not recall him to life, wished\nthat he should have no cause to regret in the other world the happiness\nof this.\n\nKara-Tété's wife was not to forsake her husband in the tomb. Moreover,\nthe unfortunate woman would not have been allowed to survive him;\nit was the custom, in accordance with duty, and examples of such\nsacrifices are not wanting in New Zealand history. The woman appeared.\nShe was still young. Her hair floated in disorder over her shoulders.\nVague words, lamentations, and broken phrases, in which she celebrated\nthe virtues of the dead, interrupted her groans; and, in a final\nparoxysm of grief, she stretched herself at the foot of the mound,\nbeating the ground with her head.\n\nAt this moment Kai-Koumou approached her.

A hundred arms threatened the\ncaptives, who trembled at the horrible sight.

But for the eternal life his faithful spouse could\nnot alone suffice the deceased. Who would serve them in presence of\nNouï-Atoua, if their slaves did not follow them?\n\nSix unfortunates were brought before the corpse of their master and\nmistress. They were servants, whom the pitiless laws of war had reduced\nto slavery. During the life of the chief they had undergone the\nseverest privations, suffered a thousand abuses, had been scantily fed,\nand compelled constantly to labor like beasts; and now, according to\nthe Maori belief, they were to continue their existence of servitude\nfor eternity.\n\nThey appeared to be resigned to their fate, and were not astonished\nat a sacrifice they had long anticipated. Their freedom from all\nbonds showed that they would meet death unresistingly. Moreover, this\ndeath was rapid, protracted sufferings were spared them. These were\nreserved for the captives who stood trembling not twenty paces distant.\nSix blows of the méré, given by six stalwart warriors, stretched the\nvictims on the ground in a pool of blood. It was the signal for a\nterrible scene of cannibalism, which followed in all its horrible\ndetails.\n\nGlenarvan and his companions, breathless with fright, strove to hide\nthis awful scene from the eyes of the two unhappy ladies. They now\nunderstood what awaited them at sunrise the next day, and what cruel\ntortures would doubtless precede such a death. They were dumb with\nhorror.\n\nThe funeral dance now began.

At the Wimerra he communicated with one of his friends,\nthe farrier of Black Point, and thus left distinguishable traces of\nour course. His band followed us. A poisonous plant enabled him to\ngradually kill our oxen and horses. Then, at the proper moment, he\nentangled us in the marshes of the Snowy, and surrendered us to the\nconvicts he commanded.\"\n\nEverything possible had been said concerning Ben Joyce. His past had\njust been reviewed by the major, and the wretch appeared as he was,--a\nbold and formidable criminal. His intentions had been clearly proved,\nand required, on the part of Glenarvan, extreme vigilance. Fortunately,\nthere was less to fear from the detected bandit than the secret traitor.\n\nBut one serious fact appeared from this explanation. No one had yet\nthought of it; only Mary Grant, disregarding the past, looked forward\nto the future. Captain Mangles first saw her pale and disconsolate. He\nunderstood what was passing in her mind.\n\n\"Miss Mary!\" cried he, \"you are weeping!\"\n\n\"What is the matter, my child?\" asked Lady Helena.\n\n\"My father, madam, my father!\" replied the young girl.\n\nShe could not continue.

Its greatest objection is the delay it will\ncause; but it spares us severe hardships, and perhaps real dangers.\nWhat do you think, friends?\"\n\n[Illustration: \"If it please your lordship, I will go.\"]\n\n\"Let us hear your advice, major,\" said Lady Helena. \"During the whole\ndiscussion you have contented yourself with listening simply.\"\n\n\"Since you ask my opinion,\" answered the major, \"I will give it to you\nvery frankly.

Ayrton, too, was surprised,\nand cast a quick glance at the major. Paganel, Lady Helena, and the\nsailors had been favorably disposed to the quartermaster's project, and\nno longer hesitated after MacNabb's declaration. Glenarvan, therefore,\nannounced that Ayrton's plan was adopted.\n\n\"And now, captain,\" added he, \"do you not think that prudence dictates\nthis course, and that we should encamp on the banks of the river while\nwaiting for the means of conveyance?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Captain Mangles, \"if the messenger succeeds in crossing\nthe Snowy, which we cannot cross ourselves.\"\n\nAll looked at the quartermaster, who smiled with the air of a man who\nknows perfectly well what he is about to do.\n\n\"The messenger will not cross the river,\" said he.\n\n\"Ah!\" cried Captain Mangles.\n\n\"He will strike the Lucknow road, which will take him direct to\nMelbourne.\"\n\n\"Two hundred miles on foot!\" exclaimed the captain.\n\n\"On horseback,\" continued Ayrton. \"There is one good horse left.

Add two days for the Duncan to\nreach the bay, twenty-four hours for the return to the encampment, and\nin a week the messenger will be back again with the crew.\"\n\n[Sidenote: CANDIDATES FOR OFFICE.]\n\nThe major again nodded approvingly at these words, to the great\nastonishment of Captain Mangles. But the quartermaster's proposition\nhad gained all the votes, and the only question was how to execute this\napparently well-conceived plan.\n\n\"Now, my friends,\" said Glenarvan, \"it remains only to choose our\nmessenger. He will have a difficult and dangerous mission; that is\ncertain. Who is willing to devote himself for his companions, and carry\nour instructions to Melbourne?\"\n\nWilson, Mulready, Captain Mangles, Paganel, and Robert offered\nthemselves immediately. The captain particularly insisted that this\nmission should be confided to him; but Ayrton, who had not yet\nfinished, resumed the conversation, and said:\n\n\"If it please your lordship, I will go.

People seemed as though they could not show him enough\nattention.\n\nJust at this time an amiable lady of thirty, none other than the\nmajor's cousin, a little eccentric herself, but still agreeable and\ncharming, fell in love with the geographer's peculiarities. Paganel was\nfar from being insensible to Miss Arabella's attractions, yet did not\ndare to declare his sentiments. The major accordingly undertook the\npart of Cupid's messenger between these two congenial hearts, and even\ntold Paganel that marriage was \"the last blunder\" that he could commit.\nBut the geographer was very much embarrassed, and, strangely enough,\ncould not summon courage to speak for himself.\n\n[Illustration: Early in the afternoon the travelers reached Malcolm\nCastle, amidst the hurrahs of their tenantry and friends.]\n\n\"Does not Miss Arabella please you?\" MacNabb would say to him.\n\n\"Oh, major, she is charming!\" cried Paganel,--\"a thousand times too\ncharming for me; and, if I must tell you, would please me better if she\nwere less so. I should like to find a defect.\"\n\n\"Be easy,\" answered the major; \"she has more than one. The most perfect\nwoman always has her share. Well, then, Paganel, are you decided?\"\n\n\"I do not dare.\"\n\n\"But, my learned friend, why do you hesitate?\"\n\n\"I am unworthy of her!\" was the geographer's invariable reply.\n\nAt last, one day, driven desperate by the irrepressible major, Paganel\nconfessed to him, under the pledge of secrecy, a peculiarity that would\nfacilitate his identification, if the police should ever be on his\ntrack!\n\n\"Bah!\" exclaimed the major.\n\n\"It is as I tell you,\" persisted Paganel.\n\n\"What matter, my worthy friend?\"\n\n\"Is that your opinion?\"\n\n\"On the contrary, you are only more remarkable. This adds to your\npersonal advantages. It makes you the inimitable individual of whom\nArabella has dreamed.\"\n\nAnd the major, preserving an imperturbable gravity, left Paganel a prey\nto the most acute anxiety.\n\nA short interview took place between MacNabb and the lady, and fifteen\nweeks after a marriage was celebrated with great pomp in the chapel of\nMalcolm Castle.\n\n[Illustration: Fifteen weeks after a marriage was celebrated with great\npomp in the chapel of Malcolm Castle.]\n\nThe geographer's secret would doubtless have remained forever\nburied in the abysses of the unknown if the major had not told it to\nGlenarvan, who did not conceal it from Lady Helena, who communicated\nit to Mrs. Mangles.

In spite of the\nrepresentations of his friends, he dared not go back to France, for\nfear of exposing the whole Geographical Society in his person to the\njests and railleries of the caricaturists.\n\nThe return of Captain Grant to Scotland was welcomed as a cause for\nnational rejoicing, and he became the popular man of old Caledonia.

The painful catastrophe he had just witnessed\nappeared effectually to have rent away the veil which the intoxication\nof the evening before had raised between himself and his memory.\n\n“So, so,” said he, in a hoarse and choking voice, to Danglars, “this,\nthen, I suppose, is a part of the trick you were concerting yesterday?\nAll I can say is, that if it be so, ’tis an ill turn, and well deserves\nto bring double evil on those who have projected it.”\n\n“Nonsense,” returned Danglars, “I tell you again I have nothing\nwhatever to do with it; besides, you know very well that I tore the\npaper to pieces.”\n\n“No, you did not!” answered Caderousse, “you merely threw it by—I saw\nit lying in a corner.”\n\n“Hold your tongue, you fool!—what should you know about it?—why, you\nwere drunk!”\n\n“Where is Fernand?” inquired Caderousse.\n\n“How do I know?” replied Danglars; “gone, as every prudent man ought to\nbe, to look after his own affairs, most likely. Never mind where he is,\nlet you and I go and see what is to be done for our poor friends.”\n\nDuring this conversation, Dantès, after having exchanged a cheerful\nshake of the hand with all his sympathizing friends, had surrendered\nhimself to the officer sent to arrest him, merely saying, “Make\nyourselves quite easy, my good fellows, there is some little mistake to\nclear up, that’s all, depend upon it; and very likely I may not have to\ngo so far as the prison to effect that.”\n\n0075m\n\n\n\n“Oh, to be sure!” responded Danglars, who had now approached the group,\n“nothing more than a mistake, I feel quite certain.”\n\nDantès descended the staircase, preceded by the magistrate, and\nfollowed by the soldiers. A carriage awaited him at the door; he got\nin, followed by two soldiers and the magistrate, and the vehicle drove\noff towards Marseilles.\n\n“Adieu, adieu, dearest Edmond!” cried Mercédès, stretching out her arms\nto him from the balcony.\n\nThe prisoner heard the cry, which sounded like the sob of a broken\nheart, and leaning from the coach he called out, “Good-bye, Mercédès—we\nshall soon meet again!” Then the vehicle disappeared round one of the\nturnings of Fort Saint Nicholas.\n\n“Wait for me here, all of you!” cried M. Morrel; “I will take the first\nconveyance I find, and hurry to Marseilles, whence I will bring you\nword how all is going on.”\n\n“That’s right!” exclaimed a multitude of voices, “go, and return as\nquickly as you can!”\n\nThis second departure was followed by a long and fearful state of\nterrified silence on the part of those who were left behind. The old\nfather and Mercédès remained for some time apart, each absorbed in\ngrief; but at length the two poor victims of the same blow raised their\neyes, and with a simultaneous burst of feeling rushed into each other’s\narms.\n\nMeanwhile Fernand made his appearance, poured out for himself a glass\nof water with a trembling hand; then hastily swallowing it, went to sit\ndown at the first vacant place, and this was, by mere chance, placed\nnext to the seat on which poor Mercédès had fallen half fainting, when\nreleased from the warm and affectionate embrace of old Dantès.\nInstinctively Fernand drew back his chair.\n\n“He is the cause of all this misery—I am quite sure of it,” whispered\nCaderousse, who had never taken his eyes off Fernand, to Danglars.\n\n“I don’t think so,” answered the other; “he’s too stupid to imagine\nsuch a scheme. I only hope the mischief will fall upon the head of\nwhoever wrought it.”\n\n“You don’t mention those who aided and abetted the deed,” said\nCaderousse.\n\n“Surely,” answered Danglars, “one cannot be held responsible for every\nchance arrow shot into the air.”\n\n“You can, indeed, when the arrow lights point downward on somebody’s\nhead.”\n\nMeantime the subject of the arrest was being canvassed in every\ndifferent form.\n\n“What think you, Danglars,” said ", "label": "CONTRADICT"}

Then the king, who,\nwithout our suspecting it, had overheard our conversation, interrupted\nus by saying, ‘Villefort’—observe that the king did not pronounce the\nword Noirtier, but, on the contrary, placed considerable emphasis on\nthat of Villefort—‘Villefort,’ said his majesty, ‘is a young man of\ngreat judgment and discretion, who will be sure to make a figure in his\nprofession; I like him much, and it gave me great pleasure to hear that\nhe was about to become the son-in-law of the Marquis and Marquise de\nSaint-Méran. I should myself have recommended the match, had not the\nnoble marquis anticipated my wishes by requesting my consent to it.’”\n\n“Is it possible the king could have condescended so far as to express\nhimself so favorably of me?” asked the enraptured Villefort.\n\n“I give you his very words; and if the marquis chooses to be candid, he\nwill confess that they perfectly agree with what his majesty said to\nhim, when he went six months ago to consult him upon the subject of\nyour espousing his daughter.”\n\n0091m\n\n\n\n“That is true,” answered the marquis.\n\n“How much do I owe this gracious prince! What is there I would not do\nto evince my earnest gratitude!”\n\n“That is right,” cried the marquise. “I love to see you thus. Now,\nthen, were a conspirator to fall into your hands, he would be most\nwelcome.”\n\n“For my part, dear mother,” interposed Renée, “I trust your wishes will\nnot prosper, and that Providence will only permit petty offenders, poor\ndebtors, and miserable cheats to fall into M. de Villefort’s\nhands,—then I shall be contented.”\n\n“Just the same as though you prayed that a physician might only be\ncalled upon to prescribe for headaches, measles, and the stings of\nwasps, or any other slight affection of the epidermis. If you wish to\nsee me the king’s attorney, you must desire for me some of those\nviolent and dangerous diseases from the cure of which so much honor\nredounds to the physician.”\n\nAt this moment, and as though the utterance of Villefort’s wish had\nsufficed to effect its accomplishment, a servant entered the room, and\nwhispered a few words in his ear. Villefort immediately rose from table\nand quitted the room upon the plea of urgent business; he soon,\nhowever, returned, his whole face beaming with delight. Renée regarded\nhim with fond affection; and certainly his handsome features, lit up as\nthey then were with more than usual fire and animation, seemed formed\nto excite the innocent admiration with which she gazed on her graceful\nand intelligent lover.\n\n“You were wishing just now,” said Villefort, addressing her, “that I\nwere a doctor instead of a lawyer. Well, I at least resemble the\ndisciples of Esculapius in one thing [people spoke in this style in\n1815], that of not being able to call a day my own, not even that of my\nbetrothal.”\n\n“And wherefore were you called away just now?” asked Mademoiselle de\nSaint-Méran, with an air of deep interest.\n\n“For a very serious matter, which bids fair to make work for the\nexecutioner.”\n\n“How dreadful!” exclaimed Renée, turning pale.\n\n“Is it possible?” burst simultaneously from all who were near enough to\nthe magistrate to hear his words.\n\n“Why, if my information prove correct, a sort of Bonapartist conspiracy\nhas just been discovered.”\n\n“Can I believe my ears?” cried the marquise.\n\n“I will read you the letter containing the accusation, at least,” said\nVillefort:\n\n“‘The king’s attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and the\nreligious institutions of his country, that one named Edmond Dantès,\nmate of the ship _Pharaon_, this day arrived from Smyrna, after having\ntouched at Naples and Porto-Ferrajo, has been the bearer of a letter\nfrom Mur", "label": "CONTRADICT"}
{"claim_id": "99_0", "claim": "Noirtier Born into a Parisian legal family, he absorbed his father’s staunch republicanism", "evidence": "nsieur; I am on the point of marrying a young girl I have been\nattached to for three years.” Villefort, impassive as he was, was\nstruck with this coincidence; and the tremulous voice of Dantès,\nsurprised in the midst of his happiness, struck a sympathetic chord in\nhis own bosom—he also was on the point of being married, and he was\nsummoned from his own happiness to destroy that of another. “This\nphilosophic reflection,” thought he, “will make a great sensation at M.\nde Saint-Méran’s;” and he arranged mentally, while Dantès awaited\nfurther questions, the antithesis by which orators often create a\nreputation for eloquence. When this speech was arranged, Villefort\nturned to Dantès.\n\n0099m\n\n\n\n“Go on, sir,” said he.\n\n“What would you have me say?”\n\n“Give all the information in your power.”\n\n“Tell me on which point you desire information, and I will tell all I\nknow; only,” added he, with a smile, “I warn you I know very little.”\n\n“Have you served under the usurper?”\n\n“I was about to be mustered into the Royal Marines when he fell.”\n\n“It is reported your political opinions are extreme,” said Villefort,\nwho had never heard anything of the kind, but was not sorry to make\nthis inquiry, as if it were an accusation.\n\n“My political opinions!” replied Dantès. “Alas, sir, I never had any\nopinions. I am hardly nineteen; I know nothing; I have no part to play.\nIf I obtain the situation I desire, I shall owe it to M. Morrel. Thus\nall my opinions—I will not say public, but private—are confined to\nthese three sentiments,—I love my father, I respect M. Morrel, and I\nadore Mercédès. This, sir, is all I can tell you, and you see how\nuninteresting it is.” As Dantès spoke, Villefort gazed at his ingenuous\nand open countenance, and recollected the words of Renée, who, without\nknowing who the culprit was, had besought his indulgence for him. With\nthe deputy’s knowledge of crime and criminals, every word the young man\nuttered convinced him more and more of his innocence. This lad, for he\nwas scarcely a man,—simple, natural, eloquent with that eloquence of\nthe heart never found when sought for; full of affection for everybody,\nbecause he was happy, and because happiness renders even the wicked\ngood—extended his affection even to his judge, spite of Villefort’s\nsevere look and stern accent. Dantès seemed full of kindness.\n\n_“Pardieu!”_ said Villefort, “he is a noble fellow. I hope I shall gain\nRenée’s favor easily by obeying the first command she ever imposed on\nme. I shall have at least a pressure of the hand in public, and a sweet\nkiss in private.” Full of this idea, Villefort’s face became so joyous,\nthat when he turned to Dantès, the latter, who had watched the change\non his physiognomy, was smiling also.\n\n“Sir,” said Villefort, “have you any enemies, at least, that you know.”\n\n“I have enemies?” replied Dantès; “my position is not sufficiently\nelevated for that. As for my disposition, that is, perhaps, somewhat\ntoo hasty; but I have striven to repress it. I have had ten or twelve\nsailors under me, and if you question them, they will tell you that\nthey love and respect me, not as a father, for I am too young, but as\nan elder brother.”\n\n“But you may have excited jealousy. You are about to become captain at\nnineteen—an elevated post; you are about to marry a pretty girl, who\nloves you; and these two pieces of good fortune may have excited the\nenvy of someone.”\n\n“You are right; you know men better than I do, and what you say may\npossibly be the case, I confess; but if such persons are among my\nacquaintances I prefer not to know it, because then I should be forced\nto hate them.”\n\n“You are wrong; you should always strive to see clearly around you. You\nseem a worthy young man; I will depart from the strict line of my duty\nto aid you in discovering the author of this accusation. Here is the\npaper; do you know the writing?” As he spoke, Villefort drew the letter\nfrom his pocket, and presented it to Dantès. Dantès read it.

Then Noirtier raised his eyes to heaven, as though to\nremind his son of a forgotten oath.\n\n“It is well, sir,” replied Villefort from below,—“it is well; have\npatience but one day longer; what I have said I will do.”\n\nNoirtier seemed to be calmed by these words, and turned his eyes with\nindifference to the other side. Villefort violently unbuttoned his\ngreatcoat, which seemed to strangle him, and passing his livid hand\nacross his forehead, entered his study.\n\nThe night was cold and still; the family had all retired to rest but\nVillefort, who alone remained up, and worked till five o’clock in the\nmorning, reviewing the last interrogatories made the night before by\nthe examining magistrates, compiling the depositions of the witnesses,\nand putting the finishing stroke to the deed of accusation, which was\none of the most energetic and best conceived of any he had yet\ndelivered.\n\nThe next day, Monday, was the first sitting of the assizes. The morning\ndawned dull and gloomy, and Villefort saw the dim gray light shine upon\nthe lines he had traced in red ink. The magistrate had slept for a\nshort time while the lamp sent forth its final struggles; its\nflickerings awoke him, and he found his fingers as damp and purple as\nthough they had been dipped in blood.\n\nHe opened the window; a bright yellow streak crossed the sky, and\nseemed to divide in half the poplars, which stood out in black relief\non the horizon. In the clover-fields beyond the chestnut-trees, a lark\nwas mounting up to heaven, while pouring out her clear morning song.\nThe damps of the dew bathed the head of Villefort, and refreshed his\nmemory.\n\n“Today,” he said with an effort,—“today the man who holds the blade of\njustice must strike wherever there is guilt.”\n\nInvoluntarily his eyes wandered towards the window of Noirtier’s room,\nwhere he had seen him the preceding night. The curtain was drawn, and\nyet the image of his father was so vivid to his mind that he addressed\nthe closed window as though it had been open, and as if through the\nopening he had beheld the menacing old man.\n\n“Yes,” he murmured,—“yes, be satisfied.”\n\nHis head dropped upon his chest, and in this position he paced his\nstudy; then he threw himself, dressed as he was, upon a sofa, less to\nsleep than to rest his limbs, cramped with cold and study. By degrees\neveryone awoke. Villefort, from his study, heard the successive noises\nwhich accompany the life of a house,—the opening and shutting of doors,\nthe ringing of Madame de Villefort’s bell, to summon the waiting-maid,\nmingled with the first shouts of the child, who rose full of the\nenjoyment of his age. Villefort also rang; his new valet brought him\nthe papers, and with them a cup of chocolate.\n\n“What are you bringing me?” said he.\n\n“A cup of chocolate.”\n\n“I did not ask for it. Who has paid me this attention?”\n\n“My mistress, sir. She said you would have to speak a great deal in the\nmurder case, and that you should take something to keep up your\nstrength;” and the valet placed the cup on the table nearest to the\nsofa, which was, like all the rest, covered with papers.\n\nThe valet then left the room. Villefort looked for an instant with a\ngloomy expression, then, suddenly, taking it up with a nervous motion,\nhe swallowed its contents at one draught. It might have been thought\nthat he hoped the beverage would be mortal, and that he sought for\ndeath to deliver him from a duty which he would rather die than fulfil.\nHe then rose, and paced his room with a smile it would have been\nterrible to witness. The chocolate was inoffensive, for M. de Villefort\nfelt no effects.\n\nThe breakfast-hour arrived, but M. de Villefort was not at table. The\nvalet re-entered.\n\n“Madame de Villefort wishes to remind you, sir,” he said, “that eleven\no’clock has just struck, and that the trial commences at twelve.”\n\n“Well,” said Villefort, “what then?”\n\n“Madame de Villefort is dressed; she is quite ready, and w", "label": "CONTRADICT"}

Captain Mangles raised one final\nobjection, that Ayrton's presence was necessary to enable them to\nfind traces of the Brittania or Captain Grant; but the major observed\nthat they should remain encamped on the banks of the Snowy till the\nmessenger's return, that it was not proposed to resume the search\nwithout him, and that consequently his absence could be in no way\nprejudicial to their interests.\n\n\"Well then, Ayrton, start,\" said Glenarvan. \"Make haste, and return to\nthe encampment by way of Eden.\"\n\nA gleam of satisfaction seemed to light up the eyes of the\nquartermaster. He turned his head to one side, though not so quickly\nbut that Captain Mangles had intercepted his glance, and instinctively\nfelt his suspicions increased.\n\nThe quartermaster made his preparations for departure, aided by the\ntwo sailors, one of whom attended to his horse, and the other to his\nprovisions.

Ayrton suddenly sprang to his feet. In his hand was a\nrevolver. A report was heard; and Glenarvan fell, struck by a bullet.\n\nBefore Captain Mangles and the sailors recovered from the surprise into\nwhich this unexpected turn of affairs had thrown them, the audacious\nconvict had escaped, and joined his band, scattered along the edge of\nthe wood of gum-trees.\n\n[Illustration: A report was heard; and Glenarvan fell, struck by a\nbullet.]\n\nThe tent did not offer a sufficient shelter against the bullets, and\nit was clearly necessary to beat a retreat. Glenarvan, who was but\nslightly injured, had risen.\n\n\"To the cart! to the cart!\" cried Captain Mangles, as he hurried on\nLady Helena and Mary Grant, who were soon in safety behind its stout\nsides.\n\nThe captain, the major, Paganel, and the sailors then seized their\nrifles, and stood ready to repel the convicts. Glenarvan and Robert had\njoined the ladies, while Olbinett hastened to the common defence.\n\nThese events had transpired with the rapidity of lightning. Captain\nMangles attentively watched the edge of the wood; but the reports\nsuddenly ceased on the arrival of Ben Joyce, and a profound silence\nsucceeded the noisy fusillade. A few wreaths of white smoke were still\ncurling up between the branches of the gum-trees, but the tall tufts of\ngastrolobium were motionless and all signs of attack had disappeared.\n\nThe major and Captain Mangles extended their examinations as far as the\ngreat trees. The place was abandoned. Numerous footprints were seen,\nand a few half-burnt cartridges smoked on the ground. The major, like\na prudent man, extinguished them, for a spark was enough to kindle a\nformidable conflagration in this forest of dry trees.\n\n\"The convicts have disappeared,\" said Captain Mangles.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the major; \"and this disappearance alarms me.

He\nhad listened in total silence. But this last word that he had uttered\nwas worth more than all the others, and startled Glenarvan at once.\n\n\"You, Paganel!\" he exclaimed; \"do you know where Captain Grant is?\"\n\n\"As well as can be known,\" answered the geographer.\n\n\"And how do you know?\"\n\n\"By that everlasting document.\"\n\n[Sidenote: A GEOGRAPHER'S REMINISCENCES.]\n\n\"Ah!\" said the major, in a tone of the most thorough incredulity.\n\n\"Listen first, MacNabb, and shrug your shoulders afterwards.

As I was writing, the paper lay on the\nground, folded so that only two syllables of its title could be seen,\nand these were _aland_. What a light broke in upon my mind!

It simply means the southern (_australes_)\ncountries.\"\n\n\"Very well.

I only\nmake two suggestions. First, forget as far as possible the previous\ninterpretations; and next, although certain passages will seem to you\nforced, and I may translate them wrongly, still, remember that they\nhave no special importance. Moreover, the French document serves as the\nbasis of my interpretation, and you must consider that it was written\nby an Englishman who could not have been perfectly familiar with the\nidioms of our language.\"\n\nSo saying, Paganel, slowly pronouncing each syllable, read the\nfollowing:\n\n\"On the 27th of June, 1862, the brig Britannia, of Glasgow, foundered,\nafter a long struggle (_agonie_), in the South (_australes_) Seas, on\nthe coasts of New Ze_aland_.

These signs of increasing dryness could not be\nmistaken, and Thalcave called attention to them.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"I am not sorry at this change,\" said Tom Austin; \"to see always grass,\nnothing but grass, becomes tiresome before long.\"\n\n\"But where there is grass there is water,\" replied the major.\n\n\"Oh, we are not in want,\" said Wilson, \"and shall find some river on\nour course.\"\n\nHowever, when Wilson said that the supply of water would not fail\nhe had not calculated for the unquenchable thirst that consumed his\ncompanions all that day; and, when he added that they would meet with\nsome stream in their journey he had anticipated too much. Indeed, not\nonly were rivers wanting, but even the artificial wells dug by the\nIndians were empty. On seeing these indications of dryness increase\nfrom mile to mile, Paganel asked Thalcave where he expected to find\nwater.\n\n\"At Lake Salinas,\" replied the Indian.\n\n\"And when shall we arrive there?\"\n\n\"To-morrow evening.\"\n\nThe natives ordinarily, when they travel on the Pampas, dig wells, and\nfind water a few feet below the surface; but the travelers, destitute\nof the necessary implements, could not employ this expedient. It was\ntherefore necessary to obtain a supply in some other way, for, if they\ndid not absolutely suffer from the tormenting desire for drink, no one\ncould entirely allay his thirst.\n\nAt evening they halted, after a journey of thirty miles. Every one\nrelied upon a good night to recruit himself after the fatigues of\nthe day; but they were greatly annoyed by a very persistent swarm of\nmosquitoes, which disappeared, however, after the wind changed.\n\nIf the major preserved his calmness in the midst of the petty\nannoyances of life, Paganel, on the contrary, could not treat the\nmatter so indifferently. He fought the mosquitoes, and sadly regretted\nthe absence of his acid-water, which would have soothed the pain of\ntheir bites. Although the major endeavored to console him, he awoke in\na very bad humor.\n\nHowever, he was very easily persuaded to set out at daybreak, for it\nwas important to arrive at Lake Salinas the same day. The horses were\nvery much exhausted: they were dying of thirst; and, although their\nriders had denied themselves on their account, still their share of\nwater had been very limited. The dryness was to-day even greater, and\nthe heat no less intolerable, with the dusty wind, the simoom of the\nPampas.\n\n[Sidenote: INDIANS AHEAD!]\n\nDuring the day the monotony of the journey was interrupted. Mulready,\nwho rode in advance, turned back, signaling the approach of a party of\nIndians. This meeting elicited different opinions. Glenarvan thought\nof the information that these natives might furnish concerning the\nshipwrecked seamen of the Britannia. Thalcave, for his part, scarcely\nenjoyed meeting in his journey the wandering Indians of the plains.\nHe considered them plunderers and robbers, and only sought to avoid\nthem. According to his orders, the little party collected together, and\nmade ready their fire-arms. It was necessary to be prepared for any\nemergency.\n\nThe Indian detachm", "label": "NEUTRAL"}

Here for a\ntime they halted, and, whilst Robert and Paganel were exploring, Lord\nand Lady Glenarvan almost stumbled over a queer object. It was human,\nindigenous, and sleeping; but at first this was all that they could\ndecide, until, as the eyes opened and the sleeper roused to active\nlife, they saw before them a boy of eight years, with a notice pinned\nto the back of his jacket which read as follows: \"TOLINÉ*, to be\nconducted to Echuca, care of Jeff Smith, Railway Porter.

He\nhad been educated in the Wesleyan Methodist day-school at Melbourne,\nand was now going for a time to visit his parents, who were living\nwith the rest of their tribe in Lachlan. He had been in the train to\nwhich the accident had happened, and had, with childlike confidence,\ntroubled less about his fate than did those of older years.

Villefort caught his arm.\n\n“Wait, my dear father,” said the young man, “one word more.”\n\n“Say on.”\n\n“However stupid the royalist police may be, they do know one terrible\nthing.”\n\n“What is that?”\n\n“The description of the man who, on the morning of the day when General\nQuesnel disappeared, presented himself at his house.”\n\n“Oh, the admirable police have found that out, have they?

Villefort watched him with alarm not devoid of admiration.\n\nHis whiskers cut off, Noirtier gave another turn to his hair; took,\ninstead of his black cravat, a colored neckerchief which lay at the top\nof an open portmanteau; put on, in lieu of his blue and high-buttoned\nfrock-coat, a coat of Villefort’s of dark brown, and cut away in front;\ntried on before the glass a narrow-brimmed hat of his son’s, which\nappeared to fit him perfectly, and, leaving his cane in the corner\nwhere he had deposited it, he took up a small bamboo switch, cut the\nair with it once or twice, and walked about with that easy swagger\nwhich was one of his principal characteristics.\n\n“Well,” he said, turning towards his wondering son, when this disguise\nwas completed, “well, do you think your police will recognize me now.”\n\n“No, father,” stammered Villefort; “at least, I hope not.”\n\n“And now, my dear boy,” continued Noirtier, “I rely on your prudence to\nremove all the things which I leave in your care.”\n\n“Oh, rely on me,” said Villefort.\n\n“Yes, yes; and now I believe you are right, and that you have really\nsaved my life; be assured I will return the favor hereafter.”\n\nVillefort shook his head.\n\n“You are not convinced yet?”\n\n“I hope at least, that you may be mistaken.”\n\n“Shall you see the king again?”\n\n“Perhaps.”\n\n“Would you pass in his eyes for a prophet?”\n\n“Prophets of evil are not in favo", "label": "SUPPORT"}

What,\nmoreover, could ten defenceless men do against thirty well-armed\nsavages? Besides, Glenarvan thought it likely that Kai-Koumou's tribe\nhad lost some chief of high rank whom they were particularly anxious to\nrecover; and he was not mistaken.\n\nThe next day the canoe ascended the river with increased swiftness.\nIt stopped for a moment at the junction of a small river which wound\nacross the plains on the right bank. Here another canoe, with ten\nnatives on board, joined Kai-Koumou. The warriors merely exchanged\nsalutations, and then continued their course. The new-comers had\nrecently fought against the English troops, as could be seen by their\ntattered garments, their gory weapons, and the wounds that still bled\nbeneath their rags. They were gloomy and taciturn, and, with the\nindifference common to all savage races, paid no attention to the\ncaptives.\n\nTowards evening Kai-Koumou landed at the foot of the mountains,\nwhose nearer ridges reached precipitously to the river-bank. Here\ntwenty natives, who had disembarked from their canoes, were making\npreparations for the night. Fires blazed beneath the trees. A chief,\nequal in rank to Kai-Koumou, advanced with measured pace, and, rubbing\nhis nose against that of the latter, saluted him cordially. The\nprisoners were stationed in the centre of the encampment, and guarded\nwith extreme vigilance.\n\nThe next morning the ascent of the Waikato was resumed. Other boats\ncame from various affluents of the river. Sixty warriors, evidently\nfugitives from the last insurrection, had now assembled, and were\nreturning, more or less wounded in the fray, to the mountain districts.\nSometimes a song arose from the canoes, as they advanced in single\nfile. One native struck up the patriotic ode of the mysterious \"Pihé,\"\nthe national hymn that calls the Maoris to battle. The full and\nsonorous voice of the singer waked the echoes of the mountains; and\nafter each stanza his comrades struck their breasts, and sang the\nwarlike verses in chorus. Then they seized their oars again, and the\ncanoes were headed up stream.\n\nDuring the day a singular sight enlivened the voyage. About four\no'clock the canoe, without lessening its speed, guided by the steady\nhand of the chief, dashed through a narrow gorge. Eddies broke\nviolently against numerous small islands, which rendered navigation\nexceeding dangerous. Never could it be more hazardous to capsize, for\nthe banks afforded no refuge, and whoever had set foot on the porous\ncrust of the shore would probably have perished. At this point the\nriver flowed between warm springs, oxide of iron colored the muddy\nground a brilliant red, and not a yard of firm earth could be seen.\nThe air was heavy with a penetrating sulphureous odor. The natives did\nnot regard it, but the captives were seriously annoyed by the noxious\nvapors exhaled from the fissures of the soil and the bubbles that\nburst and discharged their gaseous contents. Yet, however disagreeable\nthese emanations were, the eye could not but admire this magnificent\nspectacle.\n\n[Illustration: At this point the river flowed between warm springs, and\nnot a yard of firm earth could be seen.]\n\nThe canoes soon after entered a dense cloud of white smoke, whose\nwreaths rose in gradually decreasing circles above the river. On the\nshores a hundred geysers, some shooting forth masses of vapor, and\nothers overflowing in liquid columns, varied their effects, like the\njets and cascades of a fountain. It seemed as though some engineer was\ndirecting at his pleasure the outflowings of these springs, as the\nwaters and vapor, mingling in the air, formed rainbows in the sunbeams.\n\nFor two miles the canoes glided within this vapory atmosphere,\nenveloped in its warm waves that rolled along the surface of the water.\nThen the sulphureous smoke disappeared, and a pure swift current of\nfresh air refreshed the panting voyagers.

But Valentine was so weak that this recital scarcely produced the\nsame effect it would have done had she been in her usual state of\nhealth. Indeed, her brain was only the seat of vague ideas, and\nconfused forms, mingled with strange fancies, alone presented\nthemselves before her eyes.\n\nDuring the daytime Valentine’s perceptions remained tolerably clear,\nowing to the constant presence of M. Noirtier, who caused himself to be\ncarried to his granddaughter’s room, and watched her with his paternal\ntenderness; Villefort also, on his return from the law courts,\nfrequently passed an hour or two with his father and child.\n\nAt six o’clock Villefort retired to his study, at eight M. d’Avrigny\nhimself arrived, bringing the night draught prepared for the young\ngirl, and then M. Noirtier was carried away. A nurse of the doctor’s\nchoice succeeded them, and never left till about ten or eleven o’clock,\nwhen Valentine was asleep. As she went downstairs she gave the keys of\nValentine’s room to M. de Villefort, so that no one could reach the\nsick-room excepting through that of Madame de Villefort and little\nEdward.\n\nEvery morning Morrel called on Noirtier to receive news of Valentine,\nand, extraordinary as it seemed, each day found him less uneasy.\nCertainly, though Valentine still labored under dreadful nervous\nexcitement, she was better; and moreover, Monte Cristo had told him\nwhen, half distracted, he had rushed to the count’s house, that if she\nwere not dead in two hours she would be saved.

More than once the ladies and their\ncompanions had to dismount, and it was often necessary to push the\nwheels of the heavy vehicle at some steep ascent, or to hold it\nback along the edge of some dangerous precipice. The oxen, as they\ncould not work to advantage at sudden turns, had frequently to be\nunyoked, and the cart blocked to prevent it from sliding back. Ayrton\nwas repeatedly forced to bring the already exhausted horses to his\nassistance.\n\nWhether this exertion was too prolonged, or whether from some other\ncause, one of the horses gave out during the ascent. He fell suddenly,\nwithout an instant's warning. It was Mulready's horse; and when the\nsailor attempted to help him up, he found that he was dead. Ayrton\nexamined the animal carefully, but did not seem to understand the cause\nof this sudden death.\n\n\"The beast must have burst a blood-vessel,\" said Glenarvan.\n\n\"Evidently,\" replied Ayrton.\n\n\"Take my horse, Mulready,\" added Glenarvan; \"I will join Lady Helena in\nthe cart.\"\n\nMulready obeyed, and the little party continued their fatiguing ascent,\nabandoning the body to the crows.\n\nThe next day they began the descent, which was much more rapid.

Not hailstones, but pieces of ice as\nlarge as one's hand, were precipitated from the angry clouds. A sling\ncould not have hurled them with greater force, and several sharp blows\nwarned Paganel and Robert to be on their guard. The cart was pierced\nthrough in many places: indeed, few roofs could have resisted the fall\nof these cutting missiles, some of which froze to the trunks of the\ntrees. It was necessary to wait for the end of this avalanche, for fear\nof being stoned to death, and it was an hour before the party regained\nthe steep path, still slippery with icy incrustations. At evening the\ncart, considerably shattered, but still firm on its wooden wheels,\ndescended the last slopes of the Alps, between tall solitary pines, and\nreached the plains of Gippsland.\n\n[Illustration: Not hailstones, but pieces of ice as large as one's\nhand, were precipitated from the angry clouds.]\n\n[Sidenote: DIVIDED COUNSELS.]\n\nAll were impatient to gain their destination, the Pacific Ocean,\nwhere the Britannia had been wrecked.

He felt that he ought to set an example of\nfortitude to his wife and his companions, as being the husband and\nchief. Moreover, he was ready to die first for the common safety, if\ncircumstances should require it.\n\n[Sidenote: CHIEFS, CIVILIZED AND UNCIVILIZED.]\n\nHis companions were worthy of him; they shared his noble thoughts, and\ntheir calm and haughty appearance would scarcely have intimated that\nthey were being carried away to captivity and suffering. By common\nconsent, at Glenarvan's suggestion, they had resolved to feign a proud\nindifference in the presence of the savages. It was the only way of\ninfluencing those fierce natures.\n\n[Illustration: A boat might have been seen ascending the Waikato. It\nwas a canoe seventy feet long and five broad.]\n\nSince leaving the encampment, the natives, taciturn like all savages,\nhad scarcely spoken to each other. However, from a few words exchanged,\nGlenarvan perceived that they were acquainted with the English\nlanguage. He therefore resolved to question the chief in regard to the\nfate that was in store for them. Addressing Kai-Koumou, he said, in a\nfearless tone:\n\n\"Where are you taking us, chief?\"\n\nKai-Koumou gazed at him coldly without answering.\n\n\"Say, what do you expect to do with us?\" continued Glenarvan.\n\nThe chief's eyes blazed with a sudden light, and in a stern voice he\nreplied:\n\n\"To exchange you, if your friends will ransom you; to kill you, if they\nrefuse.\"\n\nGlenarvan asked no more, but hope returned to his heart. Doubtless,\nsome chiefs of the Maori tribe had fallen into the hands of the\nEnglish, and the natives would attempt to recover them by way of\nexchange; their situation, therefore, was not one for despair.\n\nMeantime the canoe rapidly ascended the river. Paganel, whose\nchangeable disposition carried him from one extreme to another, had\nregained his hopefulness.

The Villefort Family Vault\n\nTwo days after, a considerable crowd was assembled, towards ten o’clock\nin the morning, around the door of M. de Villefort’s house, and a long\nfile of mourning-coaches and private carriages extended along the\nFaubourg Saint-Honoré and the Rue de la Pépinière. Among them was one\nof a very singular form, which appeared to have come from a distance.\nIt was a kind of covered wagon, painted black, and was one of the first\nto arrive. Inquiry was made, and it was ascertained that, by a strange\ncoincidence, this carriage contained the corpse of the Marquis de\nSaint-Méran, and that those who had come thinking to attend one funeral\nwould follow two. Their number was great. The Marquis de Saint-Méran,\none of the most zealous and faithful dignitaries of Louis XVIII. and\nKing Charles X., had preserved a great number of friends, and these,\nadded to the personages whom the usages of society gave Villefort a\nclaim on, formed a considerable body.\n\nDue information was given to the authorities, and permission obtained\nthat the two funerals should take place at the same time. A second\nhearse, decked with the same funereal pomp, was brought to M. de\nVillefort’s door, and the coffin removed into it from the post-wagon.\nThe two bodies were to be interred in the cemetery of Père-Lachaise,\nwhere M. de Villefort had long since had a tomb prepared for the\nreception of his family. The remains of poor Renée were already\ndeposited there, and now, after ten years of separation, her father and\nmother were to be reunited with her.\n\nThe Parisians, always curious, always affected by funereal display,\nlooked on with religious silence while the splendid procession\naccompanied to their last abode two of the number of the old\naristocracy—the greatest protectors of commerce and sincere devotees to\ntheir principles.\n\nIn one of the mourning-coaches Beauchamp, Debray, and Château-Renaud\nwere talking of the very sudden death of the marchioness.\n\n“I saw Madame de Saint-Méran only last year at Marseilles, when I was\ncoming back from Algiers,” said Château-Renaud; “she looked like a\nwoman destined to live to be a hundred years old, from her apparent\nsound health and great activity of mind and body. How old was she?”\n\n“Franz assured me,” replied Albert, “that she was sixty-six years old.\nBut she has not died of old age, but of grief; it appears that since\nthe death of the marquis, which affected her very deeply, she has not\ncompletely recovered her reason.”\n\n“But of what disease, then, did she die?” asked Debray.\n\n“It is said to have been a congestion of the brain, or apoplexy, which\nis the same thing, is it not?”\n\n“Nearly.”\n\n“It is difficult to believe that it was apoplexy,” said Beauchamp.\n“Madame de Saint-Méran, whom I once saw, was short, of slender form,\nand of a much more nervous than sanguine temperament; grief could\nhardly produce apoplexy in such a constitution as that of ", "label": "CONTRADICT"}

Noirtier de Villefort\n\nWe will now relate what was passing in the house of the king’s attorney\nafter the departure of Madame Danglars and her daughter, and during the\ntime of the conversation between Maximilian and Valentine, which we\nhave just detailed.\n\nM. de Villefort entered his father’s room, followed by Madame de\nVillefort. Both of the visitors, after saluting the old man and\nspeaking to Barrois, a faithful servant, who had been twenty-five years\nin his service, took their places on either side of the paralytic.\n\nM. Noirtier was sitting in an armchair, which moved upon casters, in\nwhich he was wheeled into the room in the morning, and in the same way\ndrawn out again at night. He was placed before a large glass, which\nreflected the whole apartment, and so, without any attempt to move,\nwhich would have been impossible, he could see all who entered the room\nand everything which was going on around him. M. Noirtier, although\nalmost as immovable as a corpse, looked at the new-comers with a quick\nand intelligent expression, perceiving at once, by their ceremonious\ncourtesy, that they were come on business of an unexpected and official\ncharacter.\n\nSight and hearing were the only senses remaining, and they, like two\nsolitary sparks, remained to animate the miserable body which seemed\nfit for nothing but the grave; it was only, however, by means of one of\nthese senses that he could reveal the thoughts and feelings that still\noccupied his mind, and the look by which he gave expression to his\ninner life was like the distant gleam of a candle which a traveller\nsees by night across some desert place, and knows that a living being\ndwells beyond the silence and obscurity.\n\nNoirtier’s hair was long and white, and flowed over his shoulders;\nwhile in his eyes, shaded by thick black lashes, was concentrated, as\nit often happens with an organ which is used to the exclusion of the\nothers, all the activity, address, force, and intelligence which were\nformerly diffused over his whole body; and so although the movement of\nthe arm, the sound of the voice, and the agility of the body, were\nwanting, the speaking eye sufficed for all. He commanded with it; it\nwas the medium through which his thanks were conveyed. In short, his\nwhole appearance produced on the mind the impression of a corpse with\nliving eyes, and nothing could be more startling than to observe the\nexpression of anger or joy suddenly lighting up these organs, while the\nrest of the rigid and marble-like features were utterly deprived of the\npower of participation. Three persons only could understand this\nlanguage of the poor paralytic; these were Villefort, Valentine, and\nthe old servant of whom we have already spoken. But as Villefort saw\nhis father but seldom, and then only when absolutely obliged, and as he\nnever took any pains to please or gratify him whe", "label": "CONTRADICT"}

A second line of stakes, and then a fence of osiers,\npierced with loop-holes, inclosed the inner space, the court-yard of\nthe pah, in which stood several Maori tents, and forty huts which were\nsymmetrically arranged.\n\nOn their arrival, the captives were terribly impressed at sight of\nthe heads that ornamented the stakes of the second inclosure. Lady\nHelena and Mary Grant turned away their eyes with more of disgust than\nterror. These heads had most of them belonged to hostile chiefs, fallen\nin battle, whose bodies had served as food for the conquerors. The\ngeographer knew them to be such by their hollow and eyeless sockets!\n\nIn Kai-Koumou's pah only the heads of his enemies formed this frightful\nmuseum; and here, doubtless, more than one English skull had served to\nincrease the size of the chief's collection.\n\nHis hut, among those belonging to warriors of lower rank, stood at the\nrear of the pah, in front of a large open terrace. This structure was\nbuilt of stakes, interlaced with branches, and lined inside with flax\nmatting.\n\nOnly one opening gave access to the dwelling. A thick curtain, made\nof a vegetable tissue, served as a door. The roof projected so as to\nform a water-shed. Several faces, carved at the ends of the rafters,\nadorned the hut, and the curtain was covered with various imitations\nof foliage, symbolical figures, monsters, and graceful sculpturing,\na curious piece of work, fashioned by the scissors of the native\ndecorators.\n\n[Sidenote: FEMININE ORATORY.]\n\nInside of the habitation the floor was made of hard-trodden earth,\nand raised six inches above the ground. Several rush screens and some\nmattresses, covered with woven matting of long leaves and twigs,\nserved as beds. In the middle of the room a hole in a stone formed the\nfireplace, and another in the roof answered for a chimney.\n\nThe smoke, when it became sufficiently thick, perforce escaped at this\noutlet, but it of course blackened the walls of the house.\n\nOn one side of the hut were storehouses, containing the chief's\nprovisions, his harvest of flax, potatoes, and edible ferns, and\nthe ovens where the various articles of food were cooked by contact\nwith heated stones. Farther off, in small pens, pigs and goats were\nconfined, and dogs ran about seeking their scanty sustenance. They were\nrather poorly kept, for animals that formed the Maori daily food.\n\nGlenarvan and his companions had taken in the whole at a glance. They\nawaited beside an empty hut the good pleasure of the chief, exposed to\nthe insults of a crowd of old women, who surrounded them like harpies,\nand threatened them with their fists, crying and howling. Several\nEnglish words that passed their lips clearly indicated that they were\ndemanding immediate vengeance.\n\nIn the midst of these cries and threats, Lady Helena affected a\ncalmness that she could not feel in her heart. This courageous woman,\nin order that her husband's coolness might not forsake him, heroically\ncontrolled her emotions. Poor Mary Grant felt herself growing weak, and\nCaptain Mangles supported her, ready to die in her defence. The others\nendured this torrent of invectives in various ways, either indifferent\nlike the major, or increasingly annoyed like Paganel.\n\nGlenarvan, wishing to relieve Lady Helena from the assaults of these\nshrews, boldly approached Kai-Koumou, and, pointing to the hideous\nthrong, said:\n\n\"Drive them away!\"\n\nThe Maori chief gazed steadily at his prisoner without replying. Then\nwith a gesture he silenced the noisy horde. Glenarvan bowed in token of\nthanks, and slowly resumed his place among his friends.\n\nKai-Koumou, fearing an insurrection of the fanatics of his tribe, now\nled his captives to a sacred place, situated at the other end of the\npah, on the edge of a precipice.

A fit of laughter seized the\nwhole crew. Paganel, as if mad, ran to and fro, holding his head in his\nhands, and tearing his hair. However, when he had recovered from his\nfrenzy, there was still another unavoidable question to answer.\n\n\"Now, Paganel,\" said Glenarvan, \"be candid.

They wished to question him further.\n\n\"Now, Tom,\" said Glenarvan, \"let me know: did not this order to sail\nfor the coast of New Zealand seem strange to you?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord,\" replied Austin. \"I was very much surprised; but, as I\nam not in the habit of discussing the orders I receive, I obeyed.

She\ncut the Tropic of Capricorn, and her prow was headed toward the strait\nof the celebrated geographer. Now and then the low shores of Patagonia\nwere seen, but like an almost invisible line on the horizon. They\nsailed along the coast for more than ten miles, but Paganel's famous\ntelescope gave him only a vague idea of these American shores.\n\nThe vessel soon found herself at the head of the strait, and entered\nwithout hesitation. This way is generally preferred by steam-vessels\nbound for the Pacific. Its exact length is three hundred and\nseventy-six miles. Ships of the greatest tonnage can always find deep\nwater, even near its shores, an excellent bottom, and many springs of\nwater. The rivers abound in fish, the forest in game, there are safe\nand easy landings at twenty places, and, in short, a thousand resources\nthat are wanting in the Strait of Lemaire, and off the terrible rocks\nof Cape Horn, which are continually visited by storms and tempests.\n\n[Illustration: Sometimes the tips of her yards would graze the branches\nof the beeches that hung over the waves.]\n\nDuring the first hours of the passage, till you reach Cape Gregory,\nthe shores are low and sandy. The entire passage lasted scarcely\nthirty-six hours, and this moving panorama of the two shores well\nrewarded the pains the geographer took to admire it under the radiant\nbeams of the southern sun. No inhabitant appeared on the shores of the\ncontinent; and only a few Fuegians wandered along the barren rocks of\nTerra del Fuego.\n\nAt one moment the Duncan rounded the peninsula of Brunswick between\ntwo magnificent sights. Just here the strait cuts between stupendous\nmasses of granite. The base of the mountains was hidden in the heart\nof immense forests, while their summits, whitened with eternal snow,\nwere lost in the clouds. Towards the southeast Mount Taru towered\nsix thousand five hundred feet aloft. Night came, preceded by a long\ntwilight, the light melting away insensibly by gentle degrees, while\nthe sky was studded with brilliant stars.\n\nIn the midst of this partial obscurity, the yacht boldly continued on\nher course, without casting anchor in the safe bays with which the\nshores abound. Sometimes the tips of her yards would graze the branches\nof the beeches that hung over the waves. At others her propeller would\nbeat the waters of the great rivers, starting geese, ducks, snipe,\nteal, and all the feathered tribes of the marshes. Soon deserted ruins\nappeared, and fallen monuments, to which the night lent a grand aspect;\nthese were the mournful remains of an abandoned colony, whose name\nwill be an eternal contradiction to the fertility of the coasts and\nthe rich game of the forests. It was Port Famine, the place that the\nSpaniard Sarmiento colonized in 1581 with four hundred emigrants. Here\nhe founded the city of San Felipe. But the extreme severity of the cold\nweakened the colony; famine devoured those whom the winter had spared,\nand in 1587 the explorer Cavendish found the last of these four hundred\nunfortunates dying of hunger amid the ruins of a city only six years in\nexistence.\n\n[Sidenote: CHEERLESS MEMORIES.]\n\nThe vessel coasted along these deserted shores. At daybreak she sailed\nin the midst of the narrow passes, between beeches, ash-trees, and\nbirches, from the bosom of which emerged ivy-clad domes, cupolas\ntapestried with the hardy holly, and lofty spires, among which the\nobelisk of Buckland rose to a great height. Far out in the sea sported\ndroves of seals and whales of great size, judging by their spouting,\nwhich could be seen at a distance of four miles. At last they doubled\nCape Froward, still bristling with the ices of winter. On the other\nside of the strait, on Terra del Fuego, rose Mount Sarmiento to the\nheight of six thousand feet, an enormous mass of rock broken by bands\nof clouds which formed as it were an aerial archipelago in the sky.\n\n[Illustration", "label": "CONTRADICT"}

Glenarvan cast\na rapid glance around him. The crowd opened, and a warrior, dripping\nwith sweat and overcome with fatigue, appeared.\n\nAs soon as Kai-Koumou perceived him, he said in English, evidently that\nhe might be understood by the captives:\n\n\"You come from the camp of the pale-faces?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the Maori.\n\n\"You saw the prisoner, our Tohonga?\"\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n\"Is he living?\"\n\n\"He is dead!

Lady Helena\nand Mary Grant raised towards heaven a look of thankfulness.\n\nThe captives were not taken back to the temple. They were to attend\nthat day the funeral of the dead chief, and the bloody ceremonies\nconnected therewith. A party of natives conducted them to the foot of\nan enormous koudi, where these guardians remained without losing sight\nof their prisoners. The rest of the tribe, absorbed in their official\nmourning, seemed to have forgotten them.\n\nThe customary three days had elapsed since the death of Kara-Tété.

They mourned the dead in plaintive and modulated cadences.

Were Glenarvan and his\ncompanions to be released with a few thorough drenchings? At the height\nof this struggle of the elements, suddenly there appeared at the end\nof the branch which extended horizontally, a flaming globe, of the\nsize of a fist, and surrounded by a black smoke.

Paganel recognized the\nvoracious alligators peculiar to America, and called caymans in Spanish\ncountries. There were a dozen of them, beating the water with their\npowerful tails, and attacking the tree with their terrible teeth.\n\nAt this sight the unfortunate travelers felt themselves lost indeed. A\nhorrible death was in store for them,--to perish either by the flames\nor by the teeth of the alligators. There are circumstances in which\nman is powerless to struggle, and where a raging element can only be\nrepulsed by another equally strong. Glenarvan, with a wild look, gazed\nat the fire and water leagued against him, not knowing what aid to\nimplore of Heaven.\n\nThe storm had now begun to abate; but it had developed in the air a\ngreat quantity of vapor, which the electric phenomena were about to\nset in violent commotion.

They were Lord\nGlenarvan and his companions.\n\n[Sidenote: A TESTING TIME.]\n\nThe evening before, the little party, led astray by the dense fog, had\nencamped in the midst of a numerous tribe of natives. About midnight,\nthe travelers, surprised in their sleep, were made prisoners and\ncarried on board the canoe. They had not yet been maltreated, but had\ntried in vain to resist. Their arms and ammunition were in the hands of\nthe savages, and their own bullets would have quickly stretched them on\nthe earth had they attempted to escape.\n\nThey were not long in learning, by the aid of a few English words which\nthe natives used, that, being driven back by the British troops, they\nwere returning, vanquished and weakened, to the regions of the upper\nWaikato. Their chief, after an obstinate resistance, in which he lost\nhis principal warriors, was now on his way to rouse again the river\ntribes. He was called Kai-Koumou, a terrible name, which signified\nin the native language \"he who eats the limbs of his enemy.\" He was\nbrave and bold, but his cruelty equaled his bravery. No pity could be\nexpected from him. His name was well known to the English soldiers, and\na price had been set upon his head by the governor of New Zealand.\n\nThis terrible catastrophe had come upon Glenarvan just as he was\nabout reaching the long-desired harbor of Auckland, whence he would\nhave returned to his native country. Yet, looking at his calm and\npassionless countenance, you could not have divined the depth of his\nanguish, for in his present critical situation he did not betray the\nextent of his misfortunes. He felt that he ought to set an example of\nfortitude to his wife and his companions, as being the husband and\nchief. Moreover, he was ready to die first for the common safety, if\ncircumstances should require it.\n\n[Sidenote: CHIEFS, CIVILIZED AND UNCIVILIZED.]\n\nHis companions were worthy of him; they shared his noble thoughts, and\ntheir calm and haughty appearance would scarcely have intimated that\nthey were being carried away to captivity and suffering. By common\nconsent, at Glenarvan's suggestion, they had resolved to feign a proud\nindifference in the presence of the savages. It was the only way of\ninfluencing those fierce natures.\n\n[Illustration: A boat might have been seen ascending the Waikato. It\nwas a canoe seventy feet long and five broad.]\n\nSince leaving the encampment, the natives, taciturn like all savages,\nhad scarcely spoken to each other. However, from a few words exchanged,\nGlenarvan perceived that they were acquainted with the English\nlanguage. He therefore resolved to question the chief in regard to the\nfate that was in store for them. Addressing Kai-Koumou, he said, in a\nfearless tone:\n\n\"Where are you taking us, chief?\"\n\nKai-Koumou gazed at him coldly without answering.\n\n\"Say, what do you expect to do with us?\" continued Glenarvan.\n\nThe chief's eyes blazed with a sudden light, and in a stern voice he\nreplied:\n\n\"To exchange you, if your friends will ransom you; to kill you, if they\nrefuse.\"\n\nGlenarvan asked no more, but hope returned to his heart. Doubtless,\nsome chiefs of the Maori tribe had fallen into the hands of the\nEnglish, and the natives would attempt to recover them by way of\nexchange; their situation, therefore, was not one for despair.\n\nMeantime the canoe rapidly ascended the river.

The major accordingly undertook the\npart of Cupid's messenger between these two congenial hearts, and even\ntold Paganel that marriage was \"the last blunder\" that he could commit.\nBut the geographer was very much embarrassed, and, strangely enough,\ncould not summon courage to speak for himself.\n\n[Illustration: Early in the afternoon the travelers reached Malcolm\nCastle, amidst the hurrahs of their tenantry and friends.]\n\n\"Does not Miss Arabella please you?\" MacNabb would say to him.\n\n\"Oh, major, she is charming!\" cried Paganel,--\"a thousand times too\ncharming for me; and, if I must tell you, would please me better if she\nwere less so.

In spite of the\nrepresentations of his friends, he dared not go back to France, for\nfear of exposing the whole Geographical Society in his person to the\njests and railleries of the caricaturists.\n\nThe return of Captain Grant to Scotland was welcomed as a cause for\nnational rejoicing, and he became the popular man of old Caledonia.

At the end of three years their establishment had\nattained its present prosperity.\n\nThey had just finished the brief account of their career, when the\ndwelling came in sight at the end of a fine avenue of trees. It was a\ncharming house of wood and brick, surrounded by clusters of plants, and\nhad the elegant form of a Swiss cottage, while a veranda, from which\nhung Chinese lanterns, encircled it like a Roman impluvium. The windows\nwere shaded by brilliant-colored awnings, which at a distance looked\nalmost like masses of flowers. Nothing could be prettier, cozier, or\npleasanter to the sight. On the lawn and among the shrubbery round\nabout stood bronze candelabra, supporting elegant lamps with glass\nglobes, which at nightfall illumined the whole garden with a beauteous\nlight.\n\nNo farm-hands, stables, or outhouses were to be seen,--nothing that\nindicated scenes of toil. The dwellings of the workmen--a regular\nvillage, consisting of some twenty cottages--were a quarter of a mile\ndistant, in the heart of a little valley. Telegraph-wires secured\nimmediate communication between the village and the house of the\nproprietors, which, far from all tumult, was in truth \"a thing of\nbeauty.\"\n\nThe avenue was soon passed.

A piano, covered with classic and modern music;\neasels, upon which were half-finished paintings; marble statues,\nmounted on tasteful pedestals; on the walls, a few pictures by Flemish\nmasters; rich carpets, soft to the feet as grassy meadows; panels of\ntapestry, descriptive of pleasing mythological episodes; an antique\nchandelier, costly chinaware, delicate vases, and a great variety\nof articles of _virtù_, indicated a high appreciation of beauty and\ncomfort. Everything that could please, everything that could relieve\nthe tedium of a voluntary exile, everything that could remind one of a\nluxurious European home, was to be found in this fairy abode. It would\nhave been easy to imagine oneself in some princely castle of England,\nFrance, or Germany.\n\nThe five windows admitted, through delicate curtains, a light tempered\nand softened by the shadows of the veranda.

It had been supposed some of the papers might\nbe in the Arabian, Romaic, or Turkish language, and the interpreter of\nthe House was in attendance.

Noirtier’s eye began to dilate, and his eyelids\ntrembled with the same movement that may be perceived on the lips of an\nindividual about to speak, and he darted a lightning glance at Madame\nde Villefort and his son. The procureur, who knew the political hatred\nwhich had formerly existed between M. Noirtier and the elder d’Épinay,\nwell understood the agitation and anger which the announcement had\nproduced; but, feigning not to perceive either, he immediately resumed\nthe narrative begun by his wife.\n\n“Sir,” said he, “you are aware that Valentine is about to enter her\nnineteenth year, which renders it important that she should lose no\ntime in forming a suitable alliance. Nevertheless, you have not been\nforgotten in our plans, and we have fully ascertained beforehand that\nValentine’s future husband will consent, not to live in this house, for\nthat might not be pleasant for the young people, but that you should\nlive with them; so that you and Valentine, who are so attached to each\nother, would not be separated, and you would be able to pursue exactly\nthe same course of life which you have hitherto done, and thus, instead\nof losing, you will be a gainer by the change, as it will secure to you\ntwo children instead of one, to watch over and comfort you.”\n\n30165m\n\n\n\nNoirtier’s look was furious; it was very evident that something\ndesperate was passing in the old man’s mind, for a cry of anger and\ngrief rose in his throat, and not being able to find vent in utterance,\nappeared almost to choke him, for his face and lips turned quite purple\nwith the struggle. Villefort quietly opened a window, saying, “It is\nvery warm, and the heat affects M. Noirtier.” He then returned to his\nplace, but did not sit down.\n\n“This marriage,” added Madame de Villefort, “is quite agreeable to the\nwishes of M. d’Épinay and his family; besides, he had no relations\nnearer than an uncle and aunt, his mother having died at his birth, and\nhis father having been assassinated in 1815, that is to say, when he\nwas but two years old; it naturally followed that the child was\npermitted to choose his own pursuits, and he has, therefore, seldom\nacknowledged any other authority but that of his own will.”\n\n“That assassination was a mysterious affair,” said Villefort, “and the\nperpetrators have hitherto escaped detection, although suspicion has\nfallen on the head of more than one person.”\n\nNoirtier made such an effort that his lips expanded into a smile.\n\n“Now,” continued Villefort, “those to whom the guilt really belongs, by\nwhom the crime was committed, on whose heads the justice of man may\nprobably descend here, and the certain judgment of God hereafter, would\nrejoice in the opportunity thus afforded of bestowing such a\npeace-offering as Valentine on the son of him whose life they so\nruthlessly destroyed.” Noirtier had succeeded in mastering his emotion\nmore than could have been deemed possible with such an enfeebled and\nshattered frame.\n\n“Yes, I understand,” was the reply contained in his look; and this look\nexpressed a feeling of strong indignation, mixed with profound\ncontempt. Villefort fully understood his father’s meaning, and answered\nby a slight shrug of his shoulders. He then motioned to ", "label": "CONTRADICT"}

It was advisable at all\nhazards to keep track of the captain.

What,\nmoreover, could ten defenceless men do against thirty well-armed\nsavages? Besides, Glenarvan thought it likely that Kai-Koumou's tribe\nhad lost some chief of high rank whom they were particularly anxious to\nrecover; and he was not mistaken.\n\nThe next day the canoe ascended the river with increased swiftness.\nIt stopped for a moment at the junction of a small river which wound\nacross the plains on the right bank. Here another canoe, with ten\nnatives on board, joined Kai-Koumou. The warriors merely exchanged\nsalutations, and then continued their course. The new-comers had\nrecently fought against the English troops, as could be seen by their\ntattered garments, their gory weapons, and the wounds that still bled\nbeneath their rags. They were gloomy and taciturn, and, with the\nindifference common to all savage races, paid no attention to the\ncaptives.\n\nTowards evening Kai-Koumou landed at the foot of the mountains,\nwhose nearer ridges reached precipitously to the river-bank. Here\ntwenty natives, who had disembarked from their canoes, were making\npreparations for the night. Fires blazed beneath the trees. A chief,\nequal in rank to Kai-Koumou, advanced with measured pace, and, rubbing\nhis nose against that of the latter, saluted him cordially. The\nprisoners were stationed in the centre of the encampment, and guarded\nwith extreme vigilance.\n\nThe next morning the ascent of the Waikato was resumed. Other boats\ncame from various affluents of the river. Sixty warriors, evidently\nfugitives from the last insurrection, had now assembled, and were\nreturning, more or less wounded in the fray, to the mountain districts.\nSometimes a song arose from the canoes, as they advanced in single\nfile. One native struck up the patriotic ode of the mysterious \"Pihé,\"\nthe national hymn that calls the Maoris to battle. The full and\nsonorous voice of the singer waked the echoes of the mountains; and\nafter each stanza his comrades struck their breasts, and sang the\nwarlike verses in chorus. Then they seized their oars again, and the\ncanoes were headed up stream.\n\nDuring the day a singular sight enlivened the voyage. About four\no'clock the canoe, without lessening its speed, guided by the steady\nhand of the chief, dashed through a narrow gorge. Eddies broke\nviolently against numerous small islands, which rendered navigation\nexceeding dangerous. Never could it be more hazardous to capsize, for\nthe banks afforded no refuge, and whoever had set foot on the porous\ncrust of the shore would probably have perished. At this point the\nriver flowed between warm springs, oxide of iron colored the muddy\nground a brilliant red, and not a yard of firm earth could be seen.\nThe air was heavy with a penetrating sulphureous odor. The natives did\nnot regard it, but the captives were seriously annoyed by the noxious\nvapors exhaled from the fissures of the soil and the bubbles that\nburst and discharged their gaseous contents. Yet, however disagreeable\nthese emanations were, the eye could not but admire this magnificent\nspectacle.\n\n[Illustration: At this point the river flowed between warm springs, and\nnot a yard of firm earth could be seen.]\n\nThe canoes soon after entered a dense cloud of white smoke, whose\nwreaths rose in gradually decreasing circles above the river. On the\nshores a hundred geysers, some shooting forth masses of vapor, and\nothers overflowing in liquid columns, varied their effects, like the\njets and cascades of a fountain. It seemed as though some engineer was\ndirecting at his pleasure the outflowings of these springs, as the\nwaters and vapor, mingling in the air, formed rainbows in the sunbeams.\n\nFor two miles the canoes glided within this vapory atmosphere,\nenveloped in its warm waves that rolled along the surface of the water.\nThen the sulphureous smoke disappeared, and a pure swift current of\nfresh air refreshed the panting voyagers.
